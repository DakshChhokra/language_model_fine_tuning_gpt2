you have to be like that.”And then Draco Malfoy went back to his seat at the Slytherin benchand sat down like he hadn’t—he hadn’t just—he’d just—Hermione went to the nearest empty place at the Ravenclaw benchand sat down.A number of other people, rather slowly, sat down.“Daphne?” said Tracey. “Are you all right?”Draco’s heart was hammering in his chest so hard he worried it mightexplode right out of his chest in a shower of blood, like that curse AmycusCarrow had used once on a puppy.Draco’s face stayed completely controlled, because he knew (it’d beendrilled into him over and over) that if he showed the slightest sign of thefear he was feeling, his Housemates would rip him apart like a swarm ofAcromantulas.There’d been no time to check with Harry Potter, no time to plot, notime to think, just the instant of realizing that the time to start rescuingSlytherin’s reputation was right then.From all sides of the long Slytherin table, angry faces stared at Draco.But they were outnumbered by the faces that just looked puzzled.“All right, I give up,” said a sixth-year boy that Draco didn’t recognize,sitting across from him and two places to his right. “Why did you do that,Malfoy?”Although his mouth was very dry, Draco didn’t swallow. That wouldhave been a sign of fear. Instead he took a bite of carrots, which hadthe most moisture of anything on his plate, and chewed and swallowed,thinking as rapidly as he could.“You know,” Draco said, making his voice as cutting as he could—as his heart thumped even harder in his chest, as everyone around himstopped talking to listen—“there’s probably some way to make Slytherinlook even worse than attacking eight first-year girls from all four Houseswho are working together to stop bullies, but I can’t think of how. Thisway we get the benefit of what Greengrass is doing.”The puzzled faces stayed puzzled.“What?” said the sixth-year boy, and “Wait, what benefit?” said a fifthyear girl sitting to his right.“It makes Slytherin House look better,” said Draco.The Slytherins around him were giving him quizzical gazes like he’djust tried to explain algebra.“Look better to who?” said the sixth-year boy.“But you just helped a mudblood,” said the fifth-year girl. “How’s thatsupposed to look good?”Draco’s throat closed up. His brain was experiencing a hideous malfunction during which it couldn’t think of anything to say except thetruth—Then, “It’s probably some kind of tremendously clever scheme Malfoy’s got going,” said a fifth-year boy. “You know, like in The Tragedy ofLight, where everything that looks like a setback is part of the plot. Andit ends with Granger’s head on a stick and nobody suspecting that it washim.”“That makes sense,” someone said from further down the table, andthere was a lot of nodding.“Do you know what the boss’s up to?” Vincent muttered in an undertone.Gregory Goyle didn’t reply. In his mind he could hear very clearly hismaster’s voice, saying, I can’t believe I believed every word of that, the day therumor had started about Salazar Slytherin showing Potter and Grangerwhere to find bullies.“Mr. Goyle?” whispered Vincent.Gregory Goyle’s lips shaped the words, Oh no, but no sound came out.Hermione had left lunch early that day, for some reason she hadn’t felthungry. Those few seconds of horrible humiliation had kept burningthrough her mind, over and over, the feeling of her face squishing intothe mashed potatoes and then being thrown through the air and thenthe Slytherin’s boy’s voice saying ‘Apologize to me’… it might have beenthe first time in her whole life that she’d felt like hating someone. The boywho’d thrown her (Marcus Flint, they’d said his name was) and whoeverhad cast the tripping Jinx on her in the first place… she’d felt it, for onehorrible instant she’d wanted to go tell Harry that if he started gettingcreative on her behalf, she wouldn’t object.She hadn’t been a minute out of the Great Hall before she’d heard thesound of running feet behind, and turned to see Daphne racing towardher.And listened to what her Sunshine Soldier had to say…“Don’t you understand?” Daphne’s voice was barely below a shriek.“Just because someone’s nice to you doesn’t mean they’re your friend!He’s Draco Malfoy! His father’s a Death Eater, all the parents of all hisfriends are Death Eaters—Nott, Goyle, Crabbe, everyone around him, doyou get it? They all despise Muggleborns, they want everyone like youto die, they think you’re good for nothing but being a sacrifice in horribleDark rituals! Draco is the next Lord Malfoy, he’s been raised from birthto hate you and he’s been raised from birth to lie!” Daphne’s gray-greeneyes stared fiercely at her, demanding assent and understanding.“He—” Hermione said falteringly. She remembered the rooftop, theawful jolt as she started to fall, Draco Malfoy’s hand grabbing hers andholding it so hard that she’d had bruises afterward. She’d had to tell himtwice before he finally let her fall. “Maybe Draco Malfoy isn’t like them—”Daphne’s whisper was almost a scream. “If he doesn’t end up doingyou ten times as hard as he just helped you, his life is over, do you understand? I mean Lucius Malfoy would literally disinherit him! D’you knowwhat the chance is that he’s not up to something?”“Tiny?” said Hermione in a small voice.“Zero!” hissed Daphne. “I mean none! I mean less than zero! I meanthe chance is so small that you couldn’t find it with three MagnifyingCharms and a Point-Me spell and—and—and an ancient map and a centaur prophet! Everyone in Slytherin knows he’s plotting to do somethingto you and doesn’t want to be suspected, I heard someone say he was seenpointing his wand at you just before you tripped—don’t you see? This is allpart of Malfoy’s plan!”Draco sat eating his steak with roasted cauliflower florets and Ashwindersauce (it wasn’t made from real Ashwinder eggs, it just tasted like fire),trying not to laugh and trying not to cry.He’d heard about plausible deniability, but hadn’t realized how muchit mattered until he found that Malfoys didn’t have any.“You want to know my plot?” said Draco. “Here’s my plot. I’m not going to do anything and then the next time people think I’m plotting something, they won’t be sure.”“Huh…” said the fifth-year boy. “I don’t think I believe you, thatdoesn’t sound cunning enough to be really it—”“That’s what he wants you to think,” said the fifth-year girl.“Albus,” Minerva said dangerously, “did you plan all this?”“Well, if I did snap my fingers under the table, I wouldn’t just tell youthat—”The Defense Professor’s quavering hand dropped his spoon into the soupagain.“What do you mean, set you up?” said Millicent. The two of them weresitting cross-legged on Daphne’s bed, having come there straight fromthe Great Hall after lunch. “With my Seer’s eyes that stare through TimeItself, I saw you winning.”Daphne stared at Millicent, her own merely mortal eyes rather narrowed at the moment. “That boy was expecting us.”1118 *“Well, yeah!” said Millicent. “Everyone knows you’re hunting bullies!”“Hannah got hit by a really painful hex,” Daphne said. “She had tovisit a healer, Millicent! If we’re friends you should’ve warned me!”“Look, Daphne, I told you—” The Slytherin girl paused, as if trying toremember something, and then said, “I mean, I told you, what I See hasto come to pass. If I try to change it, if anyone tries to change it, reallyterrible, awful, no good, extremely bad things will happen. And then it’llcome to pass anyway. If I See you getting beaten up, I can’t tell you that,because then you’d try to not go, and then—” Millicent stopped.“And then?” Daphne said skeptically. “I mean, what happens if wejust don’t go?”“I don’t know!” said Millicent. “But it probably makes being eaten byLethifolds look like a tea party!”“Look, even I know that’s not how prophecies work,” Daphne said,then paused. “At least prophecies don’t work like that in plays…” Admittedly, there were all sorts of tragedies where trying to avoid a prophecymade it happen, or where, on the other hand, trying to go along witha prophecy was the only reason why it happened. But you could makeprophecies happen your own way if you were clever enough; or someonewho loved you enough could take your place; or with enough effort it waspossible to break a prophecy outright… Then again, in plays the Seersnever remembered what they Saw, either…Millicent must have seen Daphne’s hesitation, because the other girlstarted looking a little more confident. “Well,” Millicent said sharply,“this isn’t a play! Look, I’ll tell you if I See it being a hard battle or an easyone. But that’s all I can do, you understand? And if I say ‘hard’ you can’tnot show up! Or—or—” Millicent’s eyes rolled back in her head, and sheintoned hollowly, “Those who try to cheat their destinies will come to sad andgloomy ends—”Professor Sprout shook her head, her face looking tight.“But—” said Susan. “But you helped Harry Potter that one time—”1119 *“And it was made quite clear to me,” Professor Sprout said in a voicethat sounded like someone was using a Shrinking Charm to squeeze herthroat, “that it was Professor Snape’s job, and not mine, to keep order inSlytherin House—Miss Bones, please, you don’t have to do this if—”“Yes, I do have to,” Susan said unhappily. “I’m a Hufflepuff, we haveto be loyal.”“A mysterious parchment under your pillow?” said Harry Potter, lookingup from where he was sitting, in the Quieted nook where they were studying. Then the boy’s green eyes narrowed. “It wasn’t from Santa Claus,was it?”Pause.“Okay,” said Hermione. “I’m not going to ask, and you’re not going totell me, and we’re both going to pretend you never said that and I don’tknow anything about it—”Susan approached the table as soon as the older girl was alone, glancingaround the Hufflepuff common room to make sure nobody was watching(the way Auntie had taught her to do it, so that it wouldn’t be obvious thatshe was looking).“Hey, Susie,” said the seventh-year Hufflepuff. “Do you already needmore—”“Can I please talk to you privately for a bit?” Susan said.Jaime Astorga, seventh-year of Slytherin, and until recently considered apromising upstart on the youth dueling circuit, stood ramrod straight inProfessor Snape’s office, with his teeth clenched tight and sweat tricklingdown his spine.“I distinctly recall,” said the Head of his House in a sardonic drawl,“that I warned you, and a number of others this very morning, that there1120 *were certain first-year girls who might prove annoying, if a fighter wereincautious and allowed himself to be taken by surprise.”Professor Snape stalked in a slow circle around him.“I—” said Jaime, as more sweat beaded on his forehead. He knew howridiculous it sounded, how much of a pathetic excuse. “Sir, they shouldn’thave been able to—” One first-year-girl shouldn’t have been able to breakhis Protego, no matter what sort of ancient Charm she used—Greengrassmust have had help—But it was very clear that his Head of House wouldn’t believe that.“Oh, I quite agree,” murmured Snape in a low tone, instinct withmenace. “They shouldn’t have. I begin to wonder if Mr. Malfoy, whatever his plotting, has a point, Astorga. It cannot be good for the reputeof Slytherin’s House if our fighters, rather than demonstrating theirstrength, lose to little girls!” Snape’s voice had risen. “It is well that youhad the good taste to be defeated by a little girl who is a fellow Slytherinof a Noble House, Astorga, or I would deduct points from you myself!”Jaime Astorga’s fists clenched at his side, but he couldn’t think of athing to say.It was some time before Jaime Astorga was allowed to leave the presence of his Head of House.And afterward, only the walls, the floor, and the ceiling saw SeverusSnape’s smile.That evening Draco was visited by his father’s owl, Tanaxu, who wasn’tgreen but only because there weren’t such things as green owls. The bestFather had been able to find was an owl of the purest silver feathers, withgreat luminous green eyes, and a beak as sharp and cruel as any snake’sfang. The parchment wrapped around Tanaxu’s leg was short and to thepoint:What are you doing, my son?The parchment that Draco sent back was equally short, and it said,I am trying to stop harm done to Slytherin’s reputation, father.In as much time as it took for an owl to fly from Hogwarts to MalfoyManor and back again, the family owl bore another message to Draco,and this one said only:What are you really doing?Draco stared at the parchment he’d unwrapped from the owl’s leg.His hands trembled, as he held up the parchment to the light of his fireplace. Five words, carved in black ink, shouldn’t have been scarier thandeath.There wasn’t very much time to think. Father knew exactly how long ittook for a message to go from Malfoy Manor to Hogwarts and back again;he would know if Draco delayed to compose a careful lie.But Draco still waited until his hand stopped trembling, before hewrote his reply, the only answer he’d thought of that Father might accept.I am preparing for the next war.Draco wrapped that parchment around the owl’s leg and tied it, andthen sent Tanaxu winging out from his room, through the halls of Hogwarts, into the night.He waited, but no reply came.1122 *he red jet of fire took Hannah full in the face, flipping her end-over-heels andsmacking her head straight into the stone wall, where her pale face seemedto linger for an instant, framed by flying strands of brown-golden hair, before shecollapsed to the ground in a heap of robes, as the third and final volley of blazinggreen spirals brought down their foe’s Shield Charm.The March days marched by, filled with lectures and study and homework, breakfast and lunch and dinner.The Gryffindor boy stared at the eight of them, tension in every line of hisbody’s frame, his face working soundlessly; and then his hands released theirclenched grasp on the Slytherin boy’s lapels, and he walked away without anyonesaying a word. (Well, Lavender almost said a word—her mouth was just openingin indignation, maybe because she hadn’t gotten a chance to declaim her speech—but luckily Hermione spotted it and made the gesture that meant SHUT UP.)Then there was sleeping, of course. You wouldn’t want to forget aboutsleeping just because it seemed so normal.“Innervate!” said the young voice of Susan Bones, and Hermione’s eyes flewopen and her lips drew in air with a gasp, her lungs feeling heavy like there wasa huge weight resting on her chest. Beside her, Hannah was already sitting up,holding her head in her hands and grimacing. Daphne had warned them that this1123 *would be a ‘hard’ fight, creating a certain trepidation in Hermione, and indeed inall of them. Except maybe Susan, who’d just shown up at the appointed meetingtime, and walked alongside them without speaking, and fought the seventh-yearbully until she was the last girl standing. Maybe the Gryffindor had been reluctantto fight the last daughter of Bones, or maybe Susan had just gotten very lucky; atany rate, when Hermione had tried to sit up again, she’d realized that her chesthad felt heavy because there was, in fact, a rather large body sprawled on top ofher.And you wouldn’t want to forget about magic either, even if the actualmoment of casting a spell only formed a very small part of your day. It wasthe whole point of Hogwarts, after all.“Okay, how about if we all ride around on skateboards?” said Lavender. “Wecould get places faster than walking. And we’d look really awesome on skateboards,Muggle artifacts may not be as fast as broomsticks but they look cooler—we shouldvote on it—”As for the remaining fractions of time, you would fill that accordingto your nature: gossip about upper-year romances, or books and studysessions.Hermione reached out a trembling hand to grasp her copy of Hogwarts: AHistory from where it had fallen, the ever-comforting book only a pace distantfrom where she herself had ended up on the floor, after the red-robed upper-yeargirl had “bumped” her into a wall. And then the older Gryffindor witch had walkedaway without a look back, only a whispered “Salazar’s—” and a word that hurther more than anything the Slytherins said about mudbloods, ‘mudblood’ was justa strange wizarding word but Hermione knew the word the Gryffindor had said.She couldn’t get used to it, she just couldn’t get used to being hated. It still hurtjust as much every time it happened, and somehow it hurt even more coming fromthe Gryffindors who were supposed to be the good ones.Harry had divided up eight of his soldiers among the other armies,as ordered; he’d voluntarily given up two Chaotic Lieutenants, sendingDean Thomas to Dragon Army and then trading Seamus Finnigan to herfor Blaise Zabini, who Harry had said was being “underutilized” in Sunshine. Lavender had elected to join most of sphew in Sunshine; Traceyhad decided to stay with Chaos.“So you can work your charms on General Potter?” said Lavender, as Hermi*1124 *one ignored both of them as hard as she could. “I’ve got to say, Traces, I think ourSunshine General has him pretty well sewn up by now—you’d have better luckconvincing Hermione that the three of you should have one of those, you know,arrangements—”Nobody had figured out yet what Draco Malfoy was plotting.“Certain?” said Harry Potter, sounding rather reluctant. “You know a rationalist isn’t ever certain of anything, Hermione, not even that two and two makefour. I can’t actually read Malfoy’s mind, and if I could, I couldn’t be certain hewasn’t a perfect Occlumens. All I can say is that based on what I’ve seen of Malfoy,it’s a lot more plausible than Daphne Greengrass thinks, that he actually is tryingto show the Slytherins a better way. We should… we really should try to go alongwith that, Hermione.”(Well, Harry seemed to think Draco Malfoy was a good guy. But thenthe trouble was that Harry also tended to trust people like ProfessorQuirrell.)“Professor Quirrell,” Harry said, “I’m worried about the hatred SlytherinHouse seems to be developing for Hermione Granger.”They were sitting in the Defense Professor’s office, Harry sitting farback from the teacher’s desk (and the sense of pending disaster was stillnoticeable, even then), the empty bookcase still framing Professor Quirrell’s balding head. The cup balanced on Harry’s thigh was filled withProfessor Quirrell’s obscure, probably-expensive Chinese tea, and it saidsomething about the way Harry had been thinking lately that he’d neededto make a conscious decision to drink it.“And this concerns me for what reason?” said Professor Quirrell, sipping his tea.“Yes, well,” said Harry, “I’m just going to ignore that—oh, stop that,Professor Quirrell, you’ve been plotting to restore Slytherin House’s reputation since at least the first Friday of this year.”There might have been a tiny crack of a smile, at the edges of thosethin pale lips; and then again, there might not have been. “I thinkSlytherin’s House will do well enough in the end, Mr. Potter, regardless1125 *of the fate of one girl. But I do agree that the present outlook is notfavorable for your little friend. The bullies of two Houses, many of themwith powerful and well-connected families, see Miss Granger as a threatto their reputation and a shame to their pride. As powerful a motive asthat is to hurt her, it pales compared to the raw envy of the Gryffindors,who see an outsider gaining the laurels of heroism which they havedreamed of since childhood.” Now the smile on Professor Quirrell’s lipswas definite, though slight. “And then there are those of Slytherin Housewho hear that Salazar Slytherin’s ghost has abandoned them to favor amudblood. I wonder if you can even conceive, Mr. Potter, of how suchas they would react? Those who do not believe it would cheerfully killMiss Granger for the insult. And as for those Slytherins who wonderdeep down, in some quiet place within themselves, if it might perhapsbe true… their inner panic is something scarcely to be contemplated.”Professor Quirrell sipped his tea equably. “When you are more experienced, Mr. Potter, you will see such consequences in advance of yourplotting. As it stands, you are being ill-served by your willful ignoranceof all human nature you deem unpleasant.”Harry sipped his own tea.“Ah…” said Harry. “Professor Quirrell… help?”“I already offered Miss Granger my help,” said Professor Quirrell, “assoon as I foresaw what would develop. My student told me, in politeterms, to stay out of her business. Nor would she tell you anything different, I expect. As I have little to truly gain or lose in this matter, I hardlyintend to press the point.” The Defense Professor shrugged, his teacupheld steady in the exactly-right polite grip, so that the surface of the liquiddid not even ripple as Professor Quirrell leaned back within his chair. “Donot worry too much, Mr. Potter. Emotions run high around Miss Granger, but she is in less danger than you might imagine. When you are older,you will learn that the first and foremost thing which any ordinary persondoes is nothing.”1126 *The envelope which the Slytherin System had delivered to Daphne atlunch was unsigned, as always; the parchment within named a time anda place and said, simply, “Hard.”That wasn’t what had concerned Daphne. What had concernedDaphne was that Millicent didn’t seem to be looking in her or Tracey’sdirection at lunch that day. She’d just stared straight ahead at her plateand eaten. Millicent had looked up just once that Daphne saw, in the direction of the Hufflepuff table, and then looked quickly back down again;though Daphne was too far away to see the expression on Millicent’s face,since Millicent had sat down far away from her and Tracey.Daphne had thought about that during lunch, with a sick feeling inher stomach unlike anything she’d felt before, and which had caused herto stop eating halfway through her first plate.What I See has to come to pass… it probably makes being eaten by Lethifoldslook like a tea party…It wasn’t any conscious decision that Daphne made, nothing likeSlytherins were supposed to do, no weighing of the benefits to herself.Instead—Daphne told Hannah and Susan and everyone, that her informanthad warned her that the next bully was going to target Hufflepuffs inparticular, and that the bully planned to risk the teachers’ wrath in orderto really hurt either Hannah or Susan, like seriously, and the two of themneeded to stay out of this one.Hannah had agreed to stay out of it.Susan had—“What are you doing here?” yelled General Granger, though it was sort of ayell and a whisper at the same time.Susan’s round face didn’t change, like the Hufflepuff girl had suddenly developed the sort of experienced blankness that Daphne’s ownMother used. “Am I here, really?” Susan said calmly.“You said you wouldn’t come!”1127 *“Did I say that?” said Susan. She flipped her wand casually in onehand, leaning against the stone wall of the corridor where they werewaiting, her reddish-brown hair somehow arranging itself in perfectorder against the yellow trim of her witch’s robes. “I wonder why. MaybeI didn’t want Hannah to get any strange ideas. Hufflepuff loyalty, youknow.”“If you don’t leave,” said the Sunshine General, “I’ll call a missionabort, and we’ll all go back to our study halls, Miss Bones!”“Hey!” said Lavender. “We didn’t vote on—”“That’s fine by me,” said Susan, who was keeping a steady gaze on theother end of the corridor where it merged into the tiled hallway wherethey’d been told to expect the bully. “I’ll just stay here myself, then.”“Why—” said Daphne. Her heart was in her throat. If I try to change it,if anyone tries to change it, really terrible, awful, no good, extremely bad thingswill happen. And then it’ll come to pass anyway… “Why are you doing this?”“It’s not like me,” said Susan. “I know. But—” Susan shrugged. “People don’t always behave like themselves, you know.”They pleaded.They begged.Susan didn’t even say anything anymore, she just kept watching, waiting.Daphne was nearly crying, she kept wondering if she’d caused this, iftrying to change Fate was making this happen worse—“Daphne,” said Hermione, her voice sounding much higher thanusual, “go get a teacher. Run.”Daphne spun on her heels and started to pelt down the other directionof the stony corridor, and then she realized, and she turned back to whereall the other girls except Susan were watching her go, and Daphne, feelinglike she was about to throw up, said, “I can’t…”“What?” said Hermione.“I think it gets worse every time you try to fight it,” said Daphne. Thatwas how it worked in plays, sometimes.Hermione stared at her, and then Hermione said, “Padma.”The other Ravenclaw girl just tore right out of there without arguing.Daphne watched her go, knowing that Padma wasn’t as good a runner as1128 *her, and now wondering if maybe that would turn out to be the only reasonwhy help would come too late…“Bullies are here,” Susan said laconically. “Huh, they’ve got a hostage.”They all whirled, and looked, and saw—Three older bullies, Daphne’s eyes recognized Reese Belka who was atop lieutenant in one of the seventh-year armies, and Randolph Lee whowas number two in the Hogwarts dueling club, and worst of all, RobertJugson III, in his sixth year, whose father was almost certainly a DeathEater.All three were surrounded by Shielding Charms, blue hazes thatglowed beneath the surface in ribbons of other color and showed occasional faceting above, multi-layered shields like the three of themthought they were fighting serious duelists and had expended energyaccordingly.And behind them, bound and supported by glowing ropes, was Hannah Abbott. Her eyes were wide and panicked and her mouth was moving, though they couldn’t hear anything through the Quietus they’d put upearlier.Then Jugson made an offhand gesture with his wand, and the glowing ropes flung Hannah at them, there was a small pop as Hannah’s bodyblew through the Quieting barrier, Susan’s wand was instantly pointingat Hannah and Susan’s voice muttered “Wingardium Leviosa”—“Run!” screamed Hannah, as she was gently lowered to the ground.But the corridor behind them and in front of them was now blockedwith a glowing gray field, a barrier spell that Daphne didn’t recognize.“Do I need to explain what this is about?” Lee said with false joviality. The seventh-year duelist was sporting a smile that didn’t reach hiseyes. “Well, just in case, you little inconveniences, and that includes youMiss Greengrass, you’ve been quite enough trouble and you’ve told quiteenough lies. We brought your little friend just to make sure everyoneknew we got all of you—though I suppose the other Ravenclaw girl ishiding around a corner or clinging to the ceiling somewhere? Well, nomatter. This is your—”“Enough talk,” said Robert Jugson III, “time for pain,” and raised hiswand. “Cluthe!”1129 *Simultaneously Susan pointed her wand and said “Prismatis!” and asmall rainbow sphere formed in midair almost instantly, the miniaturebarrier so condensed and bright that it stayed intact even as Jugson’s hexhit it and bounced off toward Belka, whose wand flashed to swat awaythe dark bolt; and then a moment later the many-colored blaze was gone.Daphne’s eyes went wide for a moment; she’d never thought of usinga Prismatic Sphere like that—“Jugsy, honey?” said Belka. Her lips widened in a vicious smile. “Ithought we discussed this. First we beat them, then we play.”“P-please,” said Hermione Granger in a faltering voice, “let them go—I, I, I promise I’ll—”“Oh, really,” said Lee in an annoyed tone. “Are you about to offer toturn yourself over if we let the others go? We’ve got all of you, now.”Jugson smiled, then. “It could be funny,” said the sixth-year juniorDeath Eater, softly and with menace. “How about if you lick my shoes,mudblood, and one of your friends can go? Pick whichever one you likebest, leave the others to get hurt.”“Nope,” said the young voice of Susan Bones, “not going to happen,”and with a blindingly fast motion the Hufflepuff girl leapt leftward justas a red stunbolt erupted from Belka’s wand, Daphne could hardly seethe movement as Susan seemed to hit the corridor wall and then bounceoff it like she was a rubber ball and her legs smashed into Jugson’s face,it didn’t go through the shield but the sixth-year went sprawling backward with the impact and Susan followed him downward and her footstamped down on the boy’s wand arm, again being repelled by the shield,“Elmekia!” shouted Lee and Parvati shouted “Prismatis!” and the rainbowwall formed but the fiery blue blast passed right through it like it wasn’teven there, the bolt missed Susan by inches, there was a whirlwind ofmotion that Daphne couldn’t follow during which Belka had her feetknocked out from under her, but the older witch just rolled back to astand and then—Daphne saw it coming, and her lips started to mouth “Pris—” but itwas already too late.Three blasts of brilliance slammed into Susan at once, she had herwand raised as though she could counter them and there was a white flashas the hexes struck the magical wood, but then Susan’s legs convulsed andsent her flying into a corridor wall. Her head hit with a strange crackingsound, and then Susan fell down and lay motionless with her head at anodd-seeming angle, her wand still clutched in one outstretched hand.There was a moment of frozen silence.Parvati scrambled over to where Susan lay, pressed a thumb over thepulse point on Susan’s wrist, and then—then slowly, tremblingly, Parvatirose to her feet, her eyes huge—“Vitalis revelio,” said Lee just as Parvati opened her mouth, and Susan’sbody was surrounded by a warm red glow. Now the seventh-year boy really was grinning. “Probably just a broken collarbone, I’d say. Nice try,though.”“Merlin, they are tricky,” said Jugson.“You had me going for a second there, dearies.” The seventh-year girlwasn’t smiling at all.“Tonare!” screamed Daphne, raising her wand above her head and focusing harder than she ever had in her life. “Rava calvaria! Lucis—”She didn’t even see the hex that got her.Hermione felt the jolt of Innervation bringing her awake, and out of someintuitive strategism she didn’t roll to her feet right away; it had been a completely hopeless battle and she didn’t know what she could do but someinstinct told her that leaping to her feet wasn’t it.Just a crack, Hermione opened her eyes, and the thin rays of light thatentered them showed Parvati backing away from all three bullies, the lastgirl standing that Hermione could see.And her eyes also showed Tracey fallen not far away from her, andHermione’s wand was still in her hand; and so, desperately hoping theSlytherin girl would show more sense than she usually did, Hermionemade the wand movements as subtly as she could, and hardly movingher lips, whispered, “Innervate.”Hermione felt the spell working, but Tracey didn’t move. Hermionehoped it was because Tracey was being cunning, and waiting to…What could they do?Hermione didn’t know, and the panic that had waited through themoments of fighting was starting to eat her up inside now that she wasstill, now that she was trying to think, now that she could see that it wasall absolutely hopeless.That was when Hermione heard a thud, and though it was out of herfield of vision now, she knew that Parvati had fallen.A moment of silence came, and passed.“Now what?” said the voice of the scary-soft boy.“Now we wake up the mudblood,” said the precise voice of thescary-formal boy, “and find out who’s really behind them, not SalazarSlytherin’s ghost.”“No, dears,” said the voice of the scary-sweet girl, “first we bind themall very securely—”And then there was a sound like lightning and thunder and Hermione’s eyes widened in shock before she could stop herself, and in herwidened field of vision she saw the scary-soft boy convulsing as yellowarcs of energy crawled over him like giant blazing worms. His wandflew out of his hand as he collapsed to the ground, twitching, and then amoment later he lay still.“Is everyone else asleep now?” said a voice. “Good.”Susan Bones rose from the floor near where the scary-soft boy hadstood, neck still oddly bent. Then she rolled her head around her shoulders, a casual loose motion, and her head was straight again.The round-faced first-year girl stood facing the remaining two bullieswith one hand cocked on her hip.Grinning.And surrounded by faceted blue haze.“Polyjuice!” spat the bully-girl.“Polyfluis Reverso!” roared the remaining boy bully.Something like the form of a mirrored scarf spat out of his wand—Passed without resistance through the haze surrounding Susan—1132 *For an instant, she glowed in a strange mirror-color, like a reflectionof herself—And then the glow faded.The young girl still stood there, hand on her hip.“Wrong,” said Susan.“And this is the truth,” said Susan. “In case nobody ever told you—”In her small hand a wand rose up, blurred by the blue haze surrounding it.“You don’t mess with the ‘Puffs,” said Susan, and with a grey flash sobright it hurt Hermione’s half-closed eyes, the real battle started.It went on for a while.Some of the ceiling got melted.The girl-bully tried to cry a truce, that they would leave and take Jugson with them, and Susan roared out the syllables of a curse Hermionerecognized as Abi-Dalzim’s Horrid Wilting which was illegal in sevencountries.Eventually the girl-bully lay unconscious and unawakenable on theground, and the last boy-bully had fled leaving his companions’ bodiesbehind, and Susan was leaned over against one wall, covered in sweat andher scorched robes soaked through with wet spots, gasping for breath,and clutching at her right shoulder using her left hand.After a while Susan straightened up, and turned to look back at whereher fellow witches were sleeping on the floor.Well, they should’ve been sleeping on the floor.Lavender was already sitting up with eyes as wide as watermelons.“That…” said Lavender.“Was…” said Tracey.“What?” said Hermione.“I mean, what?” said Parvati.“Cool!” said Lavender.“Oh, hell,” said Susan Bones. Her face had already looked a little palebeneath the sweat, and now it was getting paler, looking almost frighteningly white. “Ah… could I convince you that you hallucinated all that?”There was a rapid exchange of glances. Hermione looked at Parvati,Parvati looked at Lavender, Lavender briefly locked gazes with Tracey.1133 *The four of them looked back at Susan and shook their heads.“Oh, hell,” said Susan again. “Look I’ll be back in a few minutes butI’ve really got to go now please don’t say anything bye!”And Susan ran out into the hallway, moving surprisingly fast, beforeanyone could say another word.“No, seriously, what?” said Parvati.“Innervate,” said Hermione, pointing her wand at Daphne, whosebody she hadn’t been able to see before; and Lavender pointed her wandat Hannah’s body and said the same.Hannah’s eyes opened and she tried frantically to roll to her feet, butcollapsed to the ground halfway through.“It’s okay, Hannah!” said Lavender. “We won.”“We what?” said Hannah from her little heap on the floor.Daphne hadn’t stirred, but Hermione could see her chest rising andfalling, and the breathing rhythm looked normal enough. “I think she’sokay,” said Hermione, “but—” She took a moment to swallow, her mouthwas still dry. This had all gotten way, way, way out of hand. “I think weought to take Daphne to Madam Pomfrey’s…”“Sure, sure, just give me a second here and I’ll probably be fine,” said Parvati.“Excuse me,” Hannah said in a tone that was polite, but firm. “Howdid we win? And why does the ceiling look all melty?”There was a pause.“Susan did it,” said Tracey.“Yeah,” said Parvati, voice only slightly shaky as she stood up andstarted to brush off her red-trimmed robes, “it turns out that SusanBones is the Heir of Hufflepuff and she’s opened up the long-lost entrance to Helga Hufflepuff’s Chamber of Hard Work and Practice.”“Huh?” said Hannah, who was feeling over herself as if to make sureall her body parts were still there. “I thought that was just something Professor Sprout says to teach us an Important Moral Lesson—Susan is?”Slowly, Hermione was beginning to feel a bit more together. It hadn’treally been more than thirty seconds of extreme terror, at least not theparts she’d been conscious for. “Actually,” Hermione said carefully, asher mind started to work again, “I’m pretty sure that is just something1134 *Professor Sprout says, it wasn’t in Hogwarts: A History or anywhere elseI’ve read—”“She’s a double witch!” shouted Tracey, her voice so high it cracked.“She is! She’s one of them! She’s been this whole time!”“What?” yelled Parvati, twisting around to look at Tracey. “That is thelooniest thing—”“Of course!” said Lavender, now all the way on her feet and starting tobounce up and down with excitement. “I should’ve realized!”“Susan’s a what?” said Hermione.“A double witch!” said Tracey.“You see,” said Lavender, speaking very rapidly, “There’ve always beenstories, about these children who are born as super magicians who cancast spells no one else can, and there’s a whole secret school hidden insideHogwarts with classes that only they can see and go to—”“Those are just stories!” yelled Parvati. “That’s not how real life works!I mean, sure, I read those books too—”“Just a minute, please,” said Hermione. Maybe her mind was feelinga little slow after all. “You mean even though you already get to go to amagical school and everything, you still want to go to a double magicalschool?”Lavender looked at her, puzzled. “What?” said Lavender. “Whowouldn’t want to have super extra magical powers? It would be like thiswhole amazing destiny and everything! It’d mean you were special!”Hannah nodded to that, looking up from where she’d crawled toDaphne’s side and was checking the girl for broken bones. “I wish I was adouble witch,” Hannah said, and then, sounding a little sadder, “thoughI don’t believe there is any such thing, really… what did you see Susan do,exactly? I mean, are you sure you weren’t just seeing things after gettingstunned?”Hermione truly, truly couldn’t find any words at this point.“Oh, no,” said Tracey. The Slytherin girl spun around to look at theentrance to the corridor, her robes fluttering around her. “Oh no! We’vegot to get out of here! We’ve got to get away before Susan comes backwith someone who can Super-Memory-Charm us!”“Susan wouldn’t do that!” said Parvati. “I mean, if there even was—”1135 *“WHAT’S GOING ON HERE?” roared a high-pitched squeaky voice, asProfessor Flitwick stormed into the partially melted corridor like a small,dangerously compressed package of pure academic fury, an ashen-facedPadma gasping along behind him.“What happened?” Susan blurted to the girl who looked exactly like her,except for the scorched robes damp with sweat.“Ooh, great question!” said the other Susan Bones as she rapidlyskinned off what was left of her borrowed clothes. A moment later thegirl began to Metamorphose back into her more accustomed form ofNymphadora Tonks. “Sorry but I couldn’t think of anything myself soyou’ve got about three minutes to decide on an answer to that—”As Daphne Greengrass observed afterward with some acidity, the flawin Hermione’s cunning plan to make sure that House points were takenevenly from all four Houses if they got caught, was that it didn’t work ondetentions.They’d all agreed to keep their mouths shut about Susan’s mysteriouspowers—even Tracey, after Susan threatened to have her Super-MemoryCharmed if she didn’t promise. Unfortunately, they discovered at dinnertime that someone had forgotten to tell the bullies about their agreement,and also that Susan Bones had sacrificed her soul to dreadful forbiddenpowers which now inhabited the hulk of her body and that was why they’dall gotten detention.“Hermione?” Harry Potter said to her from beside her at the dinnertable, his voice very tentative. “Please don’t take offense, and I’ll understand if you say it’s none of my business, but I think all this is starting tospin out of control.”Hermione went on mashing the slice of chocolate cake on her plateinto a seamless mush of cake and icing. “Yes,” Hermione said, her voice1136 *might have been a little acerbic, “that was what I said to Professor Flitwickwhile I was apologizing to him, that I knew things had gotten out of hand,and he yelled: Really, Miss Granger? Do you think? in a squeak so loud thatmy ears caught on fire. I mean my ears actually caught on fire. ProfessorFlitwick had to put them out again.”Harry had put his hand to his forehead. “Excuse me,” Harry said. Hisface was perfectly straight. “Sometimes I still have a little trouble getting used to that sort of thing. Hey, Hermione, remember when we wereyoung and naive and we still thought the world was a relatively understandable place?”Hermione put her fork down and looked at him for a moment. “Doyou sometimes wish you were a Muggle, Harry?”“Huh?” said Harry. “Well, of course not! I mean, even if I was a Muggle, I’d probably have tried someday to take over the worrrrlllll—” as Hermione gave him a look and the boy hastily swallowed the word and said,“I mean optimize of course, you know that’s what I really mean, Hermione!My point is, it’s not like my goals would change one way or another. Butwith magic it’s going to be a lot easier to get things done than if I had todo stuff using only the Muggle capability set. If you think about it logically, that’s why I’m going to Hogwarts instead of just ignoring all thisand studying for a career in nanotechnology.”Hermione, having finished hand-crafting her Chocolate Cake Sauce,began to dip her carrots in it and eat them.“Why do you ask?” said Harry. “Do you wish you were back in theMuggle world?”“Not exactly,” Hermione said, as she crunched into both the carrotand the chocolate. “I was just, well, feeling strange about having wantedto be a witch… Did you want to be a wizard when you were little?”“Of course,” Harry said promptly. “I also wanted psychic powers andsuper-strength and adamantium-reinforced bones and my own flyingcastle and sometimes I felt sad that I might have to settle for just being afamous scientist and an astronaut.”Hermione nodded. “You know,” she said softly, “I think the witchesand wizards who grow up here don’t really appreciate magic properly…”1137 *“Well, of course they don’t,” Harry said, “that’s what gives us our advantage. Isn’t that obvious? I mean seriously, that was bloody obvious tome within five minutes of walking into Diagon Alley.” There was a puzzled look on the boy’s face, like he couldn’t understand why she was paying attention to something so ordinary.1138 *arry walked forward a step, then another step, until a sense of uneasebegan to pervade him, a disquiet in his nerves.He said nothing, lifted no hand; the pervading sense of unease wouldsay it for him.From behind the closed door of the office came a whisper, carryingthrough the door as though no door were present.“It is not my office hours,” said that cold whisper, “nor yet the timeof our meeting. I take ten Quirrell points from you, and be glad it is notmore.”Harry stayed calm. Going through Azkaban had recalibrated his scaleof emotional disturbances; and losing a House point, which had formerlyrated five out of ten, now lay somewhere around zero point three. Harry’svoice was likewise level, as he said, “You made a testable prediction andit was falsified, Professor. I only wished to note that.”As Harry turned to go, he heard the door opening behind him, and heswung back around in some surprise.Professor Quirrell was leaning back in his chair, his head lolling backagainst its rest, as a parchment floated before him. Both the Defense Professor’s hands rested limply on the desk, as though nerveless. He might1139 *have been a corpse, excepting that the ice-blue eyes still moved, back andforth, back and forth.The parchment vanished, and was replaced by another so quickly itwas like the material had only flickered.Then the lips moved as well. “And from this,” whispered the lips, “youinfer what, Mr. Potter?”Harry was shaken by the sight, but his voice stayed even as he said,“That ordinary people do not always do nothing, and that Hermione Granger is in more danger from Slytherin House than you thought.”The lips curved, ever so barely. “So you think I have failed in my graspof human nature. But that is hardly the only possibility, boy. Do you seethe other?”Harry furrowed his brows as he stared at the Defense Professor.“I tire of this,” the Defense Professor whispered. “You will stand thereuntil you see it for yourself, or else leave.” As though Harry had stoppedexisting, the Defense Professor’s eyes looked back to the parchment, oncemore scanning back and forth.It was six parchments later that Harry saw it, and said out loud, “Youthink your prediction failed because there was some other factor at workwhich was not in your model. Some reason why Slytherin House hatesHermione more than you realized. Like when the orbital calculations forUranus were wrong, and the problem wasn’t in Newton’s Laws, it wasthat they didn’t know about Neptune—”The parchment vanished, and was not replaced. The head rose fromits lolling position then, facing Harry more directly, and the voice whichissued forth was quiet, but not toneless. “I think, boy,” Professor Quirrell said softly, but in something approaching his normal voice, “that ifall Slytherin House hated her so much, I would have seen it. And yetthree formidable fighters of that House did something rather than nothing, at risk and at cost to themselves. What force could have moved them,or willed their motion?” The icy blue glitter of the Defense Professor’seyes met Harry’s own gaze. “Some hand possessed of influence withinSlytherin, perhaps. Then how would that hand have benefited itself byharm done to the girl and her followers?”“Um…” said Harry. “It would have to be someone threatened by Hermione somehow, or someone who would get the credit if she was hurt?I don’t know anyone who fits that profile, but then I don’t know muchabout anyone in Slytherin outside first-year.” The thought was also coming to Harry that deducing a hidden mastermind from a single mildlyunexpected attack seemed like insufficient evidence to support the priorimprobability of the theory; but then it was Professor Quirrell who wasdoing the deducing…The Defense Professor was just looking at Harry, eyelids slightly lowered as though in impatience.“And yes,” said Harry, “I am sure that Draco Malfoy isn’t behind it.”A hiss of outward air like a sigh. “He is the son of Lucius Malfoy,trained to the most exacting standards. Whatever you have seen of him,even in what seem to be unguarded moments when his mask slips andyou trust that you have seen the truth beneath, even that may all be partof the face he chooses to show you.”Only if Draco successfully cast the Patronus Charm as part of keeping up theact. But Harry didn’t say that, of course; instead he just grinned slightly,and said, “So either you’ve really never read Draco’s mind, or that’s justwhat you want me to think.”There was a pause. One of the hands turned over, beckoned a finger.Harry stepped into the room. The door closed behind him.“That was not something you should have said aloud in humanspeech,” said Professor Quirrell’s soft voice. “Legilimency, on Malfoy’sheir? Did Lucius Malfoy learn of it, he would have me assassinatedoutright.”“He would try,” Harry said. It should have won a crinkle of Professor Quirrell’s eyes, but the Defense Professor’s face was unmoving. “Butsorry.”When the Defense Professor spoke again, his voice had once more become a cold whisper. “I suppose I could, and pity the assassin.” His headfell back against the chair, lolled to one side, the eyes no longer meetingHarry’s. “But these small games hardly hold my interest as they stand.Add Legilimency, and it ceases to be a game at all.”Harry hardly knew what to say. He’d seen Professor Quirrell in anangry mood once or twice before, but this seemed emptier, and Harrydidn’t know what to say to it. What’s bothering you, Professor Quirrell? hecould not ask.“What does hold your interest?” Harry said a few moments later, afterhe’d worked it out as a safer-seeming strategy for redirecting ProfessorQuirrell’s attention to positive things. Citing experimental results aboutkeeping a gratitude journal as a strategy for improving life happinessdidn’t seem like it would be taken well.“I will tell you what does not hold my interest,” said that icy whisper.“Grading Ministry-mandated essays does not hold my interest, Mr. Potter. But I have undertaken the position of Defense Professor at Hogwarts,and I will see it through to its end.” Another parchment appeared in frontof Professor Quirrell’s head, and his eyes began to scan it. “Reese Belkaheld a high position in my armies before her folly. I will offer her thechance to stay rather than being expelled, if she tells me exactly of theforces which moved her. And I shall make clear to her what will happenif she lies. I do permit myself to read faces.”The Defense Professor’s finger pointed past Harry, toward the door.“But whether you were wrong about human nature,” Harry said, “orwhether there’s some extra force at work in Slytherin House—either way,Hermione Granger is in more danger than you predicted. Last time itwas three strong fighters, so what happens after—”“She wishes not my help, nor yours,” said a soft cold voice. “I no longerfind your concerns so entertaining as I once did, Mr. Potter. Go.”Somehow, even though they were all equals and she definitely wasn’t incharge, it was always Hermione who ended up speaking first in this sortof situation.The four tables of Hogwarts, the four Houses having breakfast, wereglancing over at where they, the eight members of sphew, had gatheredoff to one side.1142 *Professor Flitwick was also staring sternly at all of them from theHead Table. Hermione wasn’t looking there, but she could feel ProfessorFlitwick’s gaze on the back of her neck. Literally feel it. It was reallycreepy.“Why’d you tell Tracey you wanted to talk to us, Mr. Potter?” said Hermione, her tone crisp.“Professor Quirrell expelled Reese Belka from her army last night,”Harry Potter said. “And from all her other after-school Defense activities.Do any of you see the significance of that? Miss Greengrass? Padma?”Harry’s eyes swept over them, as Hermione exchanged a puzzledglance with Padma, and Daphne shook her head.“Well,” Harry said quietly, “I wouldn’t actually expect you to. But whatit means is that you’re in danger, and I don’t know how much danger.”The boy squared his shoulders, looking straight into Hermione’s eyes. “Iwasn’t going to say this, but… I just wanted to offer to put you under whatever protection I could give. Make it clear to everyone that anyone whomesses with you, is messing with the Boy-Who-Lived.”“Harry!” said Hermione sharply. “You know I don’t want—”“Some of them are my friends too, Hermione.” Harry didn’t take hiseyes from hers. “And it’s their decision, not yours. Padma? You told methat I owed you no debt for what I did, and that’s the sort of thing a friendwould say.”Hermione broke her gaze from Harry, to look at where Padma wasshaking her head.“Lavender?” Harry said. “You fought well in my army, and I’ll fight foryou if you wish it.”“Thank you, General!” Lavender said crisply. “I mean Mr. Potter. No,though. I’m a heroine and a Gryffindor, and I can fight for myself.”There was a pause.“Parvati?” Harry said. “Susan? Hannah? Daphne? I don’t know anyof you so well, but it’s something I would offer anyone who came to ask itof me, I think.”One by one, the other four girls shook their heads.Hermione realized what was coming, then, but she didn’t see a singlething she could do about it.1143 *“And my loyal soldier, Chaotic Tracey?” said Harry Potter.“Really?” gasped Tracey, oblivious to the stabbing glares that Hermione and every other girl were directing at her. Tracey’s hands flew artfullyto her cheeks, though she didn’t actually manage to blush, not that Hermione could see; and her brown eyes were, if not shining, at least openedvery wide. “You’d do that? For me? I mean—I mean, of course, absolutely,General Chaos—”And so it was on that very morning that Harry Potter went over to theGryffindor table, and then the Slytherin table, and told both Houses thatanyone who hurt Tracey Davis, regardless of what she was doing at thetime, would, quote, learn the true meaning of Chaos, unquote.It was with considerable restraint that Draco Malfoy managed to prevent himself from slamming his head repeatedly into his plate of toast.They weren’t exactly scientists, the bullies of Hogwarts.But even they, Draco knew, were going to want to test it.The Society for the Promotion of Heroic Equality for Witches hadn’t announced it, it didn’t seem like it would do any good to announce it. But theyhad all quietly decided (or, in the case of Lavender, been shouted into itby all seven other girls) to take a break from fighting bullies for a while, atleast until their Heads of House weren’t looking at them quite so sharplyanymore, and older students had stopped bumping Hermione into walls.Daphne had told Millicent that they were taking a break.And so it was with some puzzlement, a few days later, that Daphnelooked at the parchment delivered to her at lunch, drawn in a hand soshaky it was almost unreadable, saying:2 this afternoon at the top of the stairs going up from the library REALLYIMPORTANT everyone has to be there—MillicentDaphne looked around, but she couldn’t see Millicent anywhere in theGreat Hall.1144 *“A message from your informant?” said Hermione, when Daphne toldher. “That’s odd— I didn’t—”“You didn’t what?” said Daphne, after the Ravenclaw girl had stoppedin mid-sentence.The Sunshine General shook her head and said, “Listen, Daphne, Ithink we need to know where these messages come from before we keepfollowing them. Look at what happened last time, how could anyone haveknown where those three bullies would be, unless they were in on it?”“I can’t say—” Daphne said. “I mean, I can’t say anything, but I knowwhere the messages come from, and I know how anyone can know.”Hermione gave Daphne a look that, for a moment, made the Ravenclaw girl look scarily like Professor McGonagall.“Uh huh,” said Hermione. “And do you know how Susan suddenlyturned into Supergirl?”Daphne shook her head, and said, “No, but I think it might be reallyimportant that if we get a message saying we should be somewhere, everyone has to be there.” Daphne hadn’t seen what had happened with Susan,after Daphne had tried to avert the prophecy by keeping Susan away. Butshe’d been told about it afterward, and now Daphne was afraid that…She might have possibly…Might possibly have Broken Something…“Uh huh,” said Hermione, who was doing the McGonagall Stare again.Nobody seemed to know where it had started, who had started it. If you’dtried tracing it afterward, tracked it back word by word and mutter bymutter, you probably would have found it all going in a huge circle.Peregrine Derrick was tapped on his shoulder as he left Potions thatmorning.Jaime Astorga heard a whisper in his ear at lunch.Robert Jugson III discovered a tiny folded note under his plate.Carl Sloper overheard two older Gryffindors whispering about it, andthey gave him significant glances as they walked past.1145 *Nobody seemed to know where the word began, or who had first spoken it, but it named the place, and it named the time, and it said that thecolor would be white.“Every single one of you had better be absolutely clear on this,” said SusanBones. The Hufflepuff girl, or whatever strange power had possessed her,wasn’t even pretending to act normal anymore. The round-faced girl wasstriding through the halls with a firm, confident gait. “If we get there andit’s just one bully, that’s fine, you can fight them the regular way. My mysterious superpowers won’t activate if there are no innocents in danger.But if five seventh-year bullies jump out of a closet, you know what youdo? That’s right, you run away and let me fight them. Finding a teacheris optional, the important thing is that you run away as soon as I createan opening. In a fight like that you are liabilities. You are civilian targets Ihave to worry about protecting. So you will get away as fast as possibleand you will not try to do anything heroic or so help me, the hour you getout of your healer’s beds I will personally show up and kick your asses rightback in. Are we all clear on that?”“Yes,” squeaked most of the girls, though in Hannah’s case it came out,“Yes, Lady Susan!”“Don’t call me that,” snapped Susan. “And I don’t think I heard you, MissBrown! I’m warning you, I have friends who write plays and if you doanything dumb, posterity will remember you as Lavender, the AmazingStupid Hostage.”(Hermione was beginning to worry about just how many other Hogwarts students besides Harry had mysterious dark sides, and whether shewas likely to develop one if she kept hanging out with them.)“Alright, Captain Bones,” said Lavender in an unusually respectfultone, as they turned another corner along the shortest way to the library,passing through a rather large corridor studded with six sets of doubledoors, three sets on either side. “Can I ask if there’s any way for me tobecome a double witch?”1146 *“Sign up for the Auror preparation program in your sixth year,” saidSusan. “It’s the next best thing. Oh, and if a famous Auror offers to oversee your summer internship, just ignore anyone who warns you that he’sa terrible influence or that you’re almost certainly going to die.”Lavender was nodding rapidly. “Got it, got it.”(Padma, who hadn’t actually been there last time, was giving Susanvery skeptical looks.)Then Susan suddenly stopped in place and her wand snapped up andshe said, “Protego Maximus!”A jolt of adrenaline went through Hermione, she was instantly drawing her wand and spinning around—But she couldn’t see anything wrong, through the greater blue hazenow surrounding them all.The other girls, who had likewise pulled into formation, were alsolooking puzzled.“Sorry!” said Susan. “Sorry, girls. Give me a moment to check thisplace out. Thinking of a certain person has just reminded me that thishall we’re in right now, with all those doors, would be an excellent placefor an ambush.”There was a moment of silence.“Now,” said a harsh male voice, blurred into unidentifiability by abuzzing undertone.All six sets of double doors slammed open.White robes filed silently forward, all-concealing white robes withoutmarks of House affiliation and white cloth hiding the faces beneath thehoods. They marched out, and marched out, crowding the great corridor in numbers too high to count easily. Less than fifty robes, probably.Certainly more than thirty. All of them already surrounded by blue haze.Susan said some Extremely Bad Words, so awful that at almost anyother time, Hermione would have noticed.“That message!” Daphne cried in sudden horror. “It wasn’t from—”“Millicent Bulstrode?” said the voice and its buzzing undertone. “No,it wasn’t. You see, Miss Greengrass, if the same girl sends off a Slytherinmessage every day you fight a bully, pretty soon someone else will notice.We’ll have a talk with her after we’re done with you.”1147 *“Miss Susan,” said Hannah in a voice just starting to quaver, “can yoube super enough to—”Wands rose in many hands. There came a series of blinding flashesof green light, a massive volley of shieldbreakers, at the end of whichthere was no more protective blue dome surrounding them, and Susanhad fallen to her knees, clutching her head.Barriers of solid blackness had sprung into being at both ends of thecorridor. Behind the double doors that Hermione could see into, therewere only unused classrooms, very dead ends.“No,” said the male voice with that buzz overlaid, “she can’t. In caseyou haven’t noticed, you’ve gotten quite a lot of people very angry at youand we have no intention of losing this time. All right everyone, prepareto fire.”The wands around the perimeter aimed again, low enough that theirenemies wouldn’t hit each other if they missed.And then another male voice, with a similar buzz accompanying it,suddenly said “Homenum Revelio!”An instant later there was another massive volley of shieldbreakersand hexes, fired on reflex at the suddenly revealed figure, shattering theshields which had almost immediately begun to form around it—And then, as that same figure fell to the ground, a stunned silence.“Professor Snape?” said the second voice. “He’s the one who’s been interfering?”It was the Potions Master of Hogwarts who now lay unconscious onthe stone floor, the dirt-spotted robes stirring for a final moment beforethey settled in place, his fallen hand outstretched toward where his wandwas slowly rolling away.“No,” said the first male voice, now sounding a bit more uncertain.Then it rallied, “No, that can’t possibly be it. He heard us passing the word,of course, and came along to make sure nobody screwed it up again. We’llwake him up afterward and apologize and he’ll Memory-Charm the children so they don’t remember, he’s a Professor so he can do that. Anyway,we should make sure we’re really alone now. Veritas Oculum!”Fully two dozen different Charms must have been spoken, then, butno more invisible people showed up. One of them in particular made Her*1148 *mione’s heart sink; she recognized it as the Charm which had been listedalongside the description of the True Cloak of Invisibility, which wouldnot reveal the Cloak, but would tell you whether it or certain other artifacts were nearby.“Girls?” whispered Susan. She was slowly pushing herself to her feet,though Hermione could see her limbs swaying and quivering. “Girls, I’msorry for what I said before. If you’ve got anything clever and heroic totry, you might as well try it.”“Oh, yeah,” Tracey Davis said then, her voice trembling. “I almost forgot.” The Slytherin girl raised her voice, and spoke.“Hey, all of you!” yelled Tracey in a high-pitched shaky shout. “Hey,are you planning to hurt me too?”“Yes, actually,” said the buzzing voice of the leader. “We are.”“I’m under Harry Potter’s protection, you know! Anyone who tries tohurt me will learn the true meaning of Chaos! So are you going to let mego?” It should have sounded defiant. It came out sounding terrified.There was a pause. Some of the hoods of the robes turned to face eachother, then turned back to face the girls.“Hm…” said the buzzing male voice. “Hm… no.”Tracey Davis put her wand away into her robes.Slowly, deliberately, she raised her right hand high in the air, andpressed her thumb and forefingers together.“Go ahead,” said that voice.Tracey Davis snapped her fingers.There was a long, awful pause.Nothing happened.“Yes, well,” said the voice—Tracey said, her voice sounding even higher and shakier, “Acathla,mundatus sum.” Her hand, stretching up still further, snapped its fingersa second time.A nameless chill went down Hermione’s spine then, a frisson of fearand disorientation like she’d just felt the floor tilt beneath her, threatening to spill her into some darkness lying beneath.“What’s she—” began a buzzing female voice.1149 *Tracey’s face looked pale, twisted with fear, but her lips moved, spilledforth sound in a high chant, “Mabra, brahoring, mabra…”A chill wind seemed to spring up within the confines of the corridor,a dark breath that caressed their faces and touched their hands with ice.“Fire at her on my count!” shouted the leading voice. “One, two, three!”and maybe-forty voices roared spells, creating a huge concentric array offiery bolts that lit the wide corridor brighter than the Sun——for the short moment before the bolts struck and vanished upona dark red octagon that appeared in the air around the girls, and thendisappeared a moment later.Hermione saw it, she saw it but she still couldn’t imagine it; shecouldn’t imagine a Shielding Charm that powerful, a spell that wouldwithstand an army.And Tracey’s voice went on chanting, her voice sounding louder andmore confident, and her face screwed up like she was trying to remembersomething very exactly.“Shuffle, duffle, muzzle, muff.Fista, wista, mista-cuff.”Now all those present could feel it, heroines and bullies alike, the sensation of some dark will pressing down on them, a tingling in the air assomething built and built and built. All the blue hazes around the whiterobes, all the shielding spells, had died out without any visible hex touching them. There were more flashes of light as more desperate spells werefired, but they fizzled out in midair like candle-flames touching water.The black barriers at the two ends of the corridor had dissipated likesmoke beneath the growing pressure, but their evaporation revealed theexits sealed, blocked by tiled slats of dark metal that looked stained asthough with blood; and as Tracey chanted “Lemarchand, Lament, Lemarchand,” a dreadful blue light began to shine out from beneath the metalslats and between them; and the six sets of double doors slammed shutall at once, as panicked white-robed bullies began to pound on them andhowl.Then Tracey’s hand slashed to her left, and she cried “Khornath!”, thenher hand pointed below her and “Slaaneth!”, above her “Nurgolth!”, andthen, to her right, “TZINTCHI!”1150 *Tracey paused, took a deep breath; and Hermione found her voice andcried, “Stop! Tracey, stop!”But there was a strange wild smile on Tracey’s face. She raised herhand still higher, and snapped her fingers a third time; and when shespoke again, beneath her high girlish voice there was an undertone asthough some lower chorus were chanting along with her.“Darkness beyond darkness, deeper than pitchest black.Buried beneath the flow of time…From darkness to darkness, your voice echoes in the emptiness,Unknown to death, nor known to life.”“What are you doing?” shrieked Parvati, and the Gryffindor girlstretched out a hand as though to pull down the Slytherin, who wasnow starting to float upward into the air; and both Daphne and Susangrabbed Parvati’s arm at the same time and Daphne cried out, “Don’t, wedon’t know what will happen if the ritual is interrupted!”“Well what happens if it gets COMPLETED?” screamed Hermione, asclose as she’d ever come to total brain meltdown.Susan’s face was white as chalk, and she whispered, “I’m sorry, MadEye…”And Tracey spoke on, her body floating higher and higher off the floor,her black hair whipping wildly around her in the chill winds.“You who know the gate, who are the gate, the key and guardian of the gate:I bid you open the way for him, and manifest his power before me!”The corridor was plunged then into utter darkness and silence, so thatonly Tracey could be seen and heard, like there was nothing left in theuniverse except her and the light illuminating her from some namelesssource.The shining girl raised her hand one final time, and with dreadfulgravity, pressed her thumb and forefinger together.And within the darkness Hermione looked at Tracey’s face and sawthat the Slytherin girl’s eyes were now, to the exact shade, the green ofHarry Potter’s.“Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres!Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres!There was a snap like thunder, and then—Harry had chosen to assume a rather relaxed posture, as he sat in a lowchair before the mighty desk of the Headmaster of Hogwarts: one legcocked over his knee, and his arms sprawling casually to either side.Harry was doing his best to disregard the noise from the surroundingdevices, although the one directly behind him that sounded like an owlhooting desperately as it was put through a woodchipper was prettydifficult to ignore.“Harry,” the old wizard said from behind the desk, the aged voice levelas the blue eyes stared out at him from beneath the shining half-moonspectacles. Headmaster Dumbledore had garbed himself in robes of midnight purple; not true formal black, but dark enough to come close indeedto deadly seriousness, as the wizarding world counted the meaning offashions. “Were you… responsible for this?”“I cannot deny that my influence was at work,” Harry said.The old wizard took off his glasses, leaned forward to stare at Harrydirectly, blue eyes to green. “I will ask you one question,” the Headmaster said in a quiet voice. “Do you think that what you did todaywas—appropriate?”“They were bullies and they came to that hallway with the direct intentof hurting Hermione Granger and seven other first-year children,” Harrysaid levelly. “If I am not too young for moral judgment, then neither arethey. No, Headmaster, they didn’t deserve to die. But they did deserve tobe stripped naked and glued to the ceiling.”The old wizard put his glasses back on. For the first time that Harryhad seen of him, the Headmaster seemed to be at a loss for words. “AsMerlin himself is my witness,” said Dumbledore, “I haven’t the faintestnotion of how I ought to react to this.”“That’s pretty much the effect I was aiming for,” said Harry. He feltlike he ought to be whistling a merry tune, but unfortunately he had neverlearned how to whistle reliably.1152 *“I need not ask you who is directly responsible,” said the Headmaster.“Only three wizards within Hogwarts might be powerful enough. I myself did not do it. Severus has assured me he was not involved. And thethird…” The Headmaster shook his head in some dismay. “You loaned theDefense Professor your Cloak, Harry. I do not think that was wise. Fornow that he has escaped detection by simple Charms, he surely knowsthat it is a Deathly Hallow—if, indeed, he did not know from its firsttouch upon his flesh.”“Professor Quirrell had already deduced my possession of an invisibility cloak,” Harry said. “And knowing him, he has probably guessed thatit is a Deathly Hallow. But in this case, Headmaster, it so happens thatProfessor Quirrell was under one of those face-concealing white robes.”There was another pause.“How very cunning,” said the Headmaster. He leaned back in histhrone and sighed. “I have spoken to the Defense Professor. Just beforeyou, indeed. I did not quite know what to say. I told him that this wasnot the approved Hogwarts policy for dealing with infractions of hallwaydiscipline, and that I did not feel it was appropriate for a Hogwartsprofessor to do what he had done.”“And what did Professor Quirrell say to that?” said Harry, who wasnot impressed with Hogwarts’s current policies for enforcing hallway discipline.The Headmaster wore a look of resignation. “He said: Fire me.”Somehow Harry managed not to cheer out loud.The Headmaster frowned. “But why did he do it, Harry?”“Because Professor Quirrell doesn’t like school bullies and I asked verypolitely,” said Harry. And he was feeling bored and I thought this might cheerhim up. “Either that or it’s part of some incredibly deep plot.”The Headmaster rose up from behind the desk, began to pace backand forth before the hatstand that held the Sorting Hat and the red slippers. “Harry, do you not feel that all of this has gotten a bit…”“Awesome?” offered Harry.“Utterly and completely out of hand would say it better,” said Dumbledore. “I am not sure there has ever been a time in the whole history ofthis school when things have become so, so… I don’t have a word for this,1153 *Harry, because things have never become like this before, and so no onehas ever needed to invent a word for it.”Harry would have tried to invent words to express how deeply complimented he felt, if he hadn’t been snerkling too hard to speak.The Headmaster was regarding him with increasing graveness.“Harry, do you understand at all why I find these events concerning?”“Honestly?” said Harry. “No, not really. I mean, of course ProfessorMcGonagall would object to anything that breaks up the dull monotonyof the Hogwarts school experience. But then Professor McGonagallwouldn’t set a chicken on fire.”The frown lines deepened on Dumbledore’s wrinkled face. “That,Harry, is not what disturbs me,” the Headmaster said quietly. “Therewas a full battle fought in these halls!”“Headmaster,” Harry said, trying to keep his voice carefully respectful,“Professor Quirrell and I did not choose for that battle to happen. Thebullies did that. We just decided to have the Light side win. I know thereare times where the boundaries of morality are uncertain, but in this casethe line separating the villains and the heroines was twenty meters talland drawn in white fire. Our intervention may have been weird, but itcertainly wasn’t wrong—”Dumbledore had gone back to his desk, sat down in his padded thronewith a dull thump, and was now covering his face with both his hands.“Am I missing something here?” Harry said. “I thought you’d be secretly on our side, Headmaster. It was the Gryffindor thing to do. TheWeasley twins would approve, Fawkes would approve—” Harry glanced atthe golden perch, but it was empty; either the phoenix had more important things to do, or the Headmaster hadn’t invited him to today’s meeting.“That,” said the Headmaster in an old and tired and somewhat muffled voice, “is precisely the problem, Harry. There is a reason why courageous young heroes are not put in charge of schools.”“All right,” Harry said. He couldn’t quite keep the skepticism out ofhis voice. “What am I missing this time?”The old wizard lifted his head, his face now solemn, and calmer. “Listen, Harry,” said Dumbledore, “hear me well; for all who wield power1154 *must learn this in time. Some things in this world are, indeed, truly simple. If you pick up a stone and drop it again, the earth will be no heavier for it, the stars will not move from their paths. I say this, Harry, sothat you know I am not pretending to be wise, when I tell you that evenas some things are simple, others are complex. There are greater wizardries which leave marks upon the world, and marks upon those whowield them, as a simple Charm would not. Those wizardries demand hesitation, consideration of consequence, a moment to weigh the meaningof their marks. And yet the most intricate magics known to me are simpler than the simplest soul. People, Harry, people are always marked, bywhat they do and by what is done to them. Do you, then, understand howto say, ‘Here is the line between hero and villain!’ is not enough to saythat what you did was right?”“Headmaster,” Harry said evenly, “this is not a decision I made at random. No, I don’t know what exact effect this will have on every singleone of the bullies present. But if I always waited for perfect informationbefore I acted, I would never do anything. When it comes to the futurepsychological development of, say, Peregrine Derrick, beating up eightfirst-year girls probably wouldn’t have been good for him. And it wasn’tenough to just stop them quietly and quickly, since then they would justtry again later; they had to see that there was a protective power worthfearing.” Harry’s voice stayed level. “But of course, since I am a good guy,I didn’t want to permanently injure them or even cause them any pain;and yet the penalty had to be enough to weigh on the minds of anyonethinking about trying it again. So, after weighing the expected outcomesas best I could with my boundedly rational intellect, I thought it would bewisest to strip the bullies naked and glue them to the ceiling.”The young hero stared directly into the old wizard’s gaze, unflinchinggreen eyes locked with the blue behind the spectacles.And since I wasn’t there and didn’t do anything personally, there’s no lawfulway to punish me under the Hogwarts school rules; the only one who acted wasProfessor Quirrell, and he’s fireproof. And just breaking the rules to get at mewouldn’t be a wise thing to do to the hero you’re grooming to fight Lord Voldemort…This time Harry actually had tried to think through all the ramifications inadvance, before he’d made the suggestion to Professor Quirrell; and for1155 *once the Defense Professor hadn’t called him a fool, just slowly smiledand then begun to laugh.“I understand your intentions, Harry,” the old wizard said. “You thinkyou have taught the bullies of Hogwarts a lesson. But if Peregrine Derrickcould learn that lesson, he would not be Peregrine Derrick. He will only beprovoked more by what you do—it is not fair, it is not right, but that is theway it is.” The old wizard closed his eyes, as though in brief pain, and thenopened them again. “Harry, the most painful truth any hero must learnis that the right cannot, should not, must not win every battle. All of thisbegan when Miss Granger fought three older enemies and won. If shehad been content with this, the echoes of her deed would have died awayin time. Yet instead she banded together with her classmates and raisedher wand in open challenge to Peregrine Derrick and all his kind; andhis kind cannot but raise their own wands in answer. So Jaime Astorgawent hunting her, and in the natural course he would have beaten her; itwould have been a sad day, but it would have ended there. There is notenough magic in eight first-year witches all together to defeat such a foe.But you could not accept that, Harry, could not let Miss Granger learn herown lessons; and so you sent the Defense Professor to watch over theminvisibly, and pierce Astorga’s shields when Daphne Greengrass struck athim—”What? thought Harry.The old wizard went on speaking. “Each time you intervened, Harry,it escalated matters further and yet further. Soon Miss Granger was facing Robert Jugson himself, the son of a Death Eater, with two strong alliesat his side. Painful indeed it would have been for her, if Miss Granger hadlost that battle. And yet again by your will and Quirinus’s hand, this timeshown more openly, she won.”Harry was still struggling with the notion of the Defense Professorwatching invisibly over sphew, guarding the heroines from harm.“And so,” the old wizard finished, “that is how we came to today,Harry, to forty-four students attacking eight first-year witches. A fullbattle in these halls! I know it was not your intent, but you must acceptsome measure of responsibility. Such things did not happen before youcame to this school, not through all my decades in Hogwarts; neither1156 *when I was a student nor when I was a Professor.”“Thank you very much,” Harry said evenly. “Though I think ProfessorQuirrell deserves more credit than me.”The blue eyes widened. “Harry…”“Those bullies were attacking victims long before this year,” Harrysaid. Despite his best efforts, his voice was starting to rise. “But nobodyseems to have taught the students that they’re allowed to fight back. Iknow it’s much harder to ignore a two-sided fight than some helpless victims getting hexed or almost pushed out of windows, but it’s not exactlyworse, is it? I wish I’d read more of Godric Gryffindor’s writings so I couldquote him, there’s got to be something in there about this. Open battlemay be louder than the victims suffering in silence, it may be harder topretend that nothing is happening, but the final result is better—”“No, it is not,” Dumbledore said. “It is not, Harry. To always fightthe darkness, to never let evil pass unchallenged—that is not heroism,but simple pride. Even Godric Gryffindor did not think that every warwas worth fighting, though he went his whole life from one battle to another.” The old wizard’s voice went quieter. “In truth, Harry, the wordsyou speak—they are not evil. No, not evil, and yet they have frightenedme. You are one who might someday wield great power, over wizardry,over your fellow wizards. And if, come that day, you still think that evilmust never pass unchallenged—” Now a note of real worry had enteredthe Headmaster’s voice. “The world has grown more fragile since theage when Hogwarts was raised; I fear it cannot bear the fury of anotherGodric Gryffindor. And he was slower to his wrath than you.” The oldwizard shook his head. “You are too ready to fight, Harry. Much tooready to fight, and Hogwarts itself is becoming a more violent placearound you.”“Well,” Harry said carefully, after weighing his words. “I don’t know ifit will help to say this, but I think you’re getting the wrong impression ofwhat I’m all about. I don’t like real fighting either. It’s scary, and violent,and somebody might get hurt. But I didn’t fight today, Headmaster.”The Headmaster frowned. “You sent the Defense Professor in yourplace—”“Professor Quirrell didn’t do any fighting either,” Harry said calmly.1157 *“There wasn’t anyone there strong enough to fight him. What happenedtoday wasn’t fighting, it was winning.”It was a while then before the old wizard spoke. “That may be as it maybe,” the Headmaster said, “but all these conflicts must end. I can hear thestrain in the air, and with each of these clashes, it rises. All this must end,decisively and soon; you must not stand in the way of its ending.”The old wizard gestured toward the great oaken door of his office, andHarry departed through it.It was with some surprise that Harry stepped out from between the hugegrey gargoyles which had made way for him, and saw that Quirinus Quirrell was still slumped against the stone of the corridor wall, a thick threadof spittle drooling from his slack mouth onto his Professorial robes, injust the same position he’d occupied when Harry had first gone up intothe Headmaster’s office.Harry waited, but the slumped man didn’t rise up; and after long awkward seconds, Harry began to walk down the corridor again.“Mr. Potter?” came a soft call, after Harry had turned two corners; aquiet voice carrying unnaturally through the halls.When Harry had returned he found Professor Quirrell still slumpedagainst the wall, but the pale eyes now watched him with keen intelligence.I’m sorry to have tired you out—It was something that Harry couldn’t say. He’d noticed the correlation between the effort Professor Quirrell expended and the time hehad to spend ‘resting’. But Harry had reasoned that if the effort was toopainful or detrimental, surely Professor Quirrell would just say no. NowHarry was wondering if that reasoning had actually been correct, and ifnot, how to apologize…The Defense Professor spoke in a quiet voice, the rest of the body unmoving. “How went your meeting with the Headmaster, Mr. Potter?”“I’m not sure,” Harry said. “Not the way I predicted. He seems tobelieve the Light should lose a lot more often than I’d consider wise. Plus1158 *I’m not sure he understands the difference between trying to fight andtrying to win. It explains a lot, actually…” Harry hadn’t read much aboutthe Wizarding War, but he’d read enough to know that the good guysprobably had acquired a pretty accurate picture of who most of the worstDeath Eaters were, and hadn’t just owled them all hand grenades over thecourse of five minutes.A soft, soft laugh from the pale lips. “Dumbledore does not comprehend the enjoyment of winning, just as he does not comprehend the enjoyment of the game. Tell me, Mr. Potter. Did you suggest this little planwith the deliberate intention of relieving my tedium?”“That was among my many motives,” Harry said, because some instinct had warned that he couldn’t just say Yes.“Do you know,” the Defense Professor said in soft reflective tones,“there are those who have tried to soften my darker moods, and thosewho have indeed participated in brightening my day, but you are the firstperson ever to succeed in doing it deliberately?” The Defense Professorseemed to straighten up from the wall with a peculiar motion whichmight have included magic as well as muscle; and the Defense Professorbegan to walk away without a look back in Harry’s direction. Only asingle small gesture of one finger indicated that Harry was to follow.“I particularly enjoyed that chant you composed for Miss Davis,” saidProfessor Quirrell after they had walked a short distance. “Though youmight have been wiser to consult me in advance, before giving it to her tomemorize.” One hand bestirred itself to within the Defense Professor’srobes and drew forth a wand, which traced a small gesture in the air, afterwhich all the faraway sounds of the castle Hogwarts fell silent. “Tell mehonestly, Mr. Potter, have you somehow acquired a familiarity with thetheory of Dark rituals? That is not the same as confessing an intent tocast them; many wizards know the principles.”“No…” Harry said slowly. He had decided some time ago against trying to sneak into the Restricted Section of the Hogwarts library, for muchthe same reason he’d decided a year earlier not to look up how to make explosives out of common household materials. Harry prided himself on atleast having more sense than people thought he did.“Oh?” said Professor Quirrell. The man was walking more normally1159 *now, and the lips curved about in a peculiar smile. “Why, perhaps youpossess a natural talent for the field, then.”“Yes, well,” Harry said wearily. “I suppose Dr. Seuss also has a naturaltalent for Dark rituals, because the part about shuffle, duffle, muzzle, muffcame from a children’s book called Bartholomew and the Oobleck—”“No, not that part,” said Professor Quirrell. His voice grew a littlestronger, took on some of its normal lecturing tone. “An ordinary Charm,Mr. Potter, can be cast merely by speaking certain words, making precisemotions of the wand, expending some of your own strength. Even powerful spells may be invoked in this way, if the magic is efficient as well asefficacious. But with the greatest of magics, speech alone does not sufficeto give them structure. You must perform specific actions, make significant choices. Nor is the temporary expenditure of your own strengthsufficient to set them in motion; a ritual requires permanent sacrifice.The power of such a greater spell, compared to ordinary Charms, can belike day compared to night. But many rituals—indeed, most—happen todemand at least one sacrifice which might inspire squeamishness. Andso the entire field of ritual magic, containing all the furthest and mostinteresting reaches of wizardry, is widely regarded as Dark. With a fewexceptions carved out by tradition, of course.” Professor Quirrell’s voicetook on a sardonic tinge. “The Unbreakable Vow is too useful to certainwealthy Houses to be outlawed entirely—even though to bind a man’s willthrough all his days is indeed a dread and terrible act, more fearsomethan many lesser rituals that wizards shun. A cynic might conclude thatwhich rituals are prohibited is not so much a matter of morality, as habit.But I digress…” Professor Quirrell made a brief coughing sound, a clearing of his throat. “The Unbreakable Vow requires three participants andthree sacrifices. The one who receives the Unbreakable Vow must be onewho could have come to trust the Vower, but chooses instead to demandthe Vow from them, and they sacrifice that possibility of trust. The onewho makes the Vow must be someone who could have chosen to do whatthe Vow demands of them, and they sacrifice that capacity for choice.And the third wizard, the binder, permanently sacrifices a small portionof their own magic, to sustain the Vow forever.”“Ah,” Harry said. “I’d wondered why that spell wasn’t used all over1160 *the place, every time two people have difficulty trusting each other…although… why don’t wizards on their deathbeds charge money tobind Unbreakable Vows, and use that to leave an inheritance for theirchildren—”“Because they are stupid,” said Professor Quirrell. “There are hundreds of useful rituals which could be performed if men had so muchsense; I could name twenty without stopping to draw breath. But in anycase, Mr. Potter, the thing about such rituals—whether or not you chooseto term them Dark—is that they are shaped to be magically efficacious,not to appear impressive when performed. I suppose there is a certaintendency for the more powerful rituals to require more dreadful sacrifices. Even so, the most terrible ritual known to me demands only a ropewhich has hanged a man and a sword which has slain a woman; and thatfor a ritual which promised to summon Death itself—though what is trulymeant by that I do not know and do not care to discover, since it was alsosaid that the counterspell to dismiss Death had been lost. The most dreadchant I have encountered does not sound even a hundredth as fearsomeas the chant you composed for Miss Davis. Those among the bullies whohad a passing familiarity with Dark rituals—and I am certain that therewere some—must have been terrified beyond the capacity of words todescribe. If there existed a true ritual which appeared that impressive,Mr. Potter, it would melt the Earth.”“Um,” said Harry.Professor Quirrell’s lips twisted further. “Ah, but the truly amusingthing was this. You see, Mr. Potter, the chant of every ritual names thatwhich is to be sacrificed, and that which is to be gained. The chant whichyou gave to Miss Davis spoke, first, of a darkness beyond darkness, buriedbeneath the flow of time, which knows the gate, and is the gate. And thesecond thing spoken of, Mr. Potter, was the manifestation of your ownpresence. And always, in each element of the ritual, first is named thatwhich is sacrificed, and then is said the use commanded of it.”“I… see,” said Harry, as he trod through the halls of Hogwarts afterProfessor Quirrell, following him toward the Defense Professor’s office. “So my chant, the way I wrote it, implies that the Outer God, YogSothoth—”“Was permanently sacrificed in a ritual which but briefly manifestedyour presence,” said Professor Quirrell. “I suppose we will discover tomorrow whether anyone took that seriously, when we read the newspapers and see whether all the magical nations of the world are bandingtogether in a desperate effort to seal off your incursion into our reality.”They walked on, as the Defense Professor began chuckling, oddthroaty sounds.The two of them didn’t talk after that until they came to the DefenseProfessor’s office, and then the man halted with his hand upon the door.“It is a very strange thing,” the Defense Professor said, his voice nowsoft again, almost inaudible. The man was not looking at Harry, andHarry saw only his back. “A very strange thing… There was a time when Iwould have sacrificed a finger from my wand hand, to work upon the bullies of Hogwarts as we have worked upon them this day. To make themfear me as they now fear you, to have the deference of all the students andthe adoration of many, I would have given my finger for that. You haveeverything now that I wanted then. All that I know of human nature saysthat I should hate you. And yet I do not. It is a very strange thing.”It should have been a touching moment, but instead Harry felt a coldness traveling down his spine, as though he were a little fish in the sea,and some vast white shark had just looked him over and decided after avisible hesitation not to eat him.The man opened the door to Defense Professor’s office, and passedwithin, and was gone.1162 *Aftermath:Her fellow Slytherins were looking at Daphne like… like they didn’thave the faintest idea of how to look at her.The Gryffindors were looking at her like they didn’t have the faintestidea of how to look at her.Showing no fear, Daphne Greengrass strode into the Potions classroom, wrapped in the imperious dignity of a Noble and Most AncientHouse. Inside she was feeling much the same way everyone else probablydid.It had been two hours since the What? when the What? had happenedand Daphne’s brain was still going: What? What? What?The classroom was quiet as they all waited for Professor Snape to arrive. Lavender and Parvati sat near a cluster of other Gryffindors, surrounded by silent stares. The two of them were looking over each other’shomework before class started, and nobody else was helping them or talking to them. Even Lavender, who Daphne would have sworn could neverbe fazed by anything, seemed subdued.Daphne sat down at her desk, and took Magical Draughts and Potionsout of her bag, and began looking over her own homework, doing her verybest to act normal. People stared at her, and said nothing—A gasp went through the whole classroom. Girls and boys flinchedback, leaning away from the door like they were stalks of wheat touchedby a gust of wind.In the door stood Tracey Davis, wrapped in a black tattered cloakwhich had been draped over her Hogwarts uniform.Tracey walked slowly into the classroom, swaying slightly with eachstep, looking like she was trying to drift. She sat down at her accustomeddesk, which happened to be right next to Daphne’s.Slowly Tracey’s head turned to stare at Daphne.“See?” the Slytherin girl said in a low, sepulchral tone. “I told you I’dget him before she did.”“What?” blurted Daphne, who immediately wished she hadn’t saidanything.1163 *“I got Harry Potter before Granger did.” Tracey’s voice was still low,but her eyes were gleaming with triumph. “See, Daphne, what GeneralPotter wants in a girl isn’t a pretty face or a pretty dress. He wants a girlwilling to channel his dread powers, that’s what he wants. Now I’m his—and he’s mine!”This announcement produced a frozen silence through the wholeclassroom.“Excuse me, Miss Davis,” said the cultured voice of Draco Malfoy,who seemed unconcerned as he shuffled through his own Potions parchments. The other scion of a Most Ancient House didn’t so much as glanceup from his desk, even as everyone else turned to look at him. “Did HarryPotter actually tell you that? Using those words?”“Well, no…” Tracey said, and then her eyes flashed angrily. “But he’dbetter take me in, now that I’ve sacrificed my soul to him and everything!”“You sacrificed your soul to Harry Potter?” gasped Millicent. There wasa clatter from the other side of the room as Ron Weasley dropped hisinkwell.“Well, I’m pretty sure I did,” said Tracey, sounding briefly uncertainbefore she rallied. “I mean, I looked at myself in a mirror and I look palernow, and I can always feel darkness surrounding me, and I was a conduitfor his dread powers and everything… Daphne, you also saw my eyes gogreen, right? I didn’t see it myself but that’s what I heard afterward.”There was a pause, broken only by the sounds of Ron Weasley tryingto clean up his desk.“Daphne?” said Tracey.“I don’t believe it,” said an angry voice. “There’s no way the next DarkLord would take you to be his bride!”Slowly, and with considerable disbelief, heads turned to stare at PansyParkinson.“Hush, you,” said Tracey, “or I’ll…” The Slytherin girl paused. ThenTracey’s voice went even lower, and she said, “Hush, you, or I’ll devouryour soul.”“You can’t do that,” said Pansy, in the confident tones of a hen whichhad worked out a perfectly good pecking order where she was at the top,and wasn’t about to go updating that belief based on mere evidence.1164 *Slowly, like she was trying to float, Tracey got up from her desk. Therewere more gasps. Daphne felt like she’d been Petrified in place within herchair.“Tracey?” said Lavender in a small voice. “Please don’t do all thatagain. Please?”Now Pansy was showing definite nervousness as Tracey swayed toward her desk. “What d’you think you’re doing?” Pansy said, not quitemanaging to sound indignant.“I told you,” Tracey said menacingly. “I’m going to devour your soul.”Tracey bent down over Pansy, who sat frozen at her desk; and, withtheir lips almost touching, made a loud inhaling noise.“There!” said Tracey as she straightened. “I ate your soul.”“No you didn’t!” said Pansy.“Did too!” said Tracey.There was a very slight pause—“Merlin, she did!” cried Theodore Nott. “You look all pale now, andyour eyes seem empty!”“What?” screeched Pansy, turning pale. The girl leapt up from herdesk and began frantically rummaging through her bookbag. After Pansydrew out a mirror and looked at herself, she turned even paler.Daphne abandoned all pretense of aristocratic poise and let her headfall to the desk with a dull thud, as she wondered whether going to thesame school as all the other important families was really worth going tothe same school as the Chaos Legion.“Ooh, you’re in trouble now, Pansy,” said Seamus Finnigan. “I don’tknow exactly what happens when a Dementor Kisses you, but if TraceyDavis kisses you that’s probably even worse.”“I’ve heard about people without souls,” Dean Thomas said gloomily.“They have to dress all in black, and they write awful poetry, and nothingever makes them happy. They’re all angsty.”“I don’t want to be angsty!” cried Pansy.“Too bad,” said Dean Thomas. “You’ve got to be, now that your soul’sgone.”1165 *Pansy turned, and stretched out a begging hand toward Draco Malfoy’s desk. “Draco!” she said pleadingly. “Mr. Malfoy! Please, makeTracey give me back my soul!”“I can’t,” said Tracey. “I ate it.”“Make her throw it up!” yelled Pansy.The heir of Malfoy had slumped forward, resting his head in bothhands, so that nobody could see his face. “Why is my life like this?” saidDraco Malfoy.A wild babble of whispers started up as Tracey returned to her desk,now smiling in satisfaction, while Pansy stood in the midst of the classroom, wringing her hands and tears starting from her eyes—“Be. Quiet.”The soft, lethal voice seemed to fill the whole classroom as ProfessorSnape stalked in through the door. His face was angrier than Daphnehad ever seen it, sending a jolt of genuine fear down her spine. Hastilyshe looked down at her homework.“Sit down, Parkinson,” the Potions Master hissed, “and you, Davis,take off that ridiculous cloak—”“Professor Snaaaaaape!” wailed Pansy Parkinson in tears. “Tracey atemy sooouuul!”1166 *t was a looping, meandering alley in the midst of Hogwarts, wanderinglike a stray lock of hair; sometimes crossing itself, it seemed, but youcouldn’t ever get to the end if you gave into the temptation of apparentshortcuts.At the end of the tangle, six students leaned against rough stones,robes black against the grey walls and trimmed in green, eyes dartingfrom one to each other. Torches burned in the windowless sconce, casting light to ward off the darkness and heat to ward off the chill of theSlytherin dungeons.“I am certain,” Reese Belka snapped, “absolutely certain, that was notrue ritual. Little firstie witches can’t do that kind of magic, and evenif they could, who’s ever heard of a Dark ritual which sacrifices a sealedhorror for—that?”“Were you—” said Lucian Bole. “I mean—after that girl snapped herfingers—”Belka’s glare should have melted him. “No,” she spat, “I was not.”“That is, she wasn’t naked,” drawled Marcus Flint, his broad shoulders leaning back in apparent relaxation against the lumpy stone surface.“Covered in chocolate frosting, yes, but not naked.”“This day Potter has offered great insult to our Houses,” said the grimvoice of Jaime Astorga.1167 *“Yes, well, I’m sorry to be blunt,” Randolph Lee said evenly. Theseventh-year duelist rubbed at his chin, where a faint fuzz of beard hadbeen allowed to grow. “But when someone sticks you to the ceiling, it’s amessage, Astorga. It’s a message which says: I’m an incredibly powerfulDark Wizard who could’ve done anything to you I damn well pleased,and I don’t care if your House is offended, either.”Robert Jugson III gave a soft, low laugh at this, a chuckle that sentchills down several spines. “It makes you wonder if you picked the wrongside, doesn’t it? I’ve heard tales about messages like that, sent at the oldDark Lord’s bidding…”“I’m not ready to kneel to Potter just yet,” said Astorga, staring hardinto Jugson’s eyes.“Neither am I,” said Belka.Jugson was holding his wand, and he turned it idly back and forth inhis fingers, pointing it up and then downward. “Are you a Gryffindor ora Slytherin?” said Jugson. “Everyone’s got a price. Everyone smart.”This statement produced a moment of silence.“Shouldn’t Malfoy be here?” Bole said tentatively.Flint gave a dismissive flick of his fingers. “Whatever Malfoy’s plotting, he wants to put on an air of innocence. He can’t be seen missing atthe same time as us.”“But everyone knows that already,” said Bole. “Even in the otherHouses.”“Yes, very clumsy,” said Belka. She snorted. “Malfoy or no, he’s just alittle firstie and we don’t need him here.”“I will owl my father,” Jugson said softly, “and he will speak to LordMalfoy himself—” Abruptly, Jugson stopped speaking.“I don’t know about you, dearies,” Belka said with fake sweetness, “butI don’t plan on running scared from a false ritual, and I’m not done withPotter and his pet mudblood.”Nobody answered. All their gazes were looking past her.Slowly, Belka turned around to see what the others were staring at.“You will do nothing,” hissed their Head of House. Severus Snape’sface was enraged, when he spoke small spots of spittle flew from hismouth, further dotting his already-dirtied robes. “You fools have done1168 *enough! You have embarrassed my House—lost to first-years—now youspeak of embroiling noble Lords of the Wizengamot in your patheticchildish squabbles? I shall deal with this matter. You will not embarrassthis House again, you will not risk embarrassing this House again! Youare done with fighting witches, and if I hear otherwise—”If you thought they’d be sitting next to each other at dinnertime, afterthat, you’d be quite mistaken.“What does she want from me?” came the plaintive cry of a boy who,for all his extensive reading in the scientific literature, was still a bit naiveabout certain things. “Did she want to get beaten up?”The upper-year Ravenclaw boys who’d sat down next to him at thedinner-table exchanged swift glances with each other until, by some unspoken protocol, the most experienced of their number spoke.“Look,” said Arty Grey, the seventh-year who was leading in their competition by three witches and a Defense Professor, “the thing you’ve gotto understand is, just because she’s angry doesn’t mean you lost points.Miss Granger is angry because she got all frightened and you’re there tobe blamed, you understand? But at the same time, even though she won’tadmit it, she’ll be touched that her boyfriend went to such ridiculous andfrankly insane lengths to protect her.”“This is not about points,” ground out Harry Potter, the words visiblyescaping from between his clenched teeth. Dinner sat ignored on the table in front of him. “This is about justice. And I. Am. Not. Her. Boyfriend!”This was met by a certain amount of sniggering from all present.“Yeah, well,” said a sixth-year Ravenclaw boy, “I think after she kissesyou to bring you out of Dementation and you stick forty-four bullies tothe ceiling for her, we’ve gone way past ‘she’s not my girlfriend, really’and into the question of what your kids will be like. Wow, that’s a scarythought…” The Ravenclaw trailed off and then said, in a smaller voice,“Please don’t look at me like that.”1169 *“Look,” said Arty Grey, “I’m sorry to be blunt about this, but you canhave justice or you can have girls, you can’t have both at the same time.”He clapped a companionable hand on Harry Potter’s shoulder. “You’vegot potential, kid, more potential than any wizard I’ve ever seen, butyou’ve got to learn how to use it, you know? Be a bit sweeter to them,learn some spells to clean up that mess you call hair. Above all, youneed to hide your evilness better—not too well, but better. Nice wellgroomed boys get girls, and Dark Wizards also get girls, but nice wellgroomed boys suspected of being secretly Dark get more girls than youcan imagine—”“Not interested,” Harry said flatly, as he picked up the boy’s hand fromhis shoulder and unceremoniously dropped it.“But you will be,” said Arty Grey, his voice low and foreboding. “Ah,you will be!”Elsewhere along the same table—“Romantic?” shrieked Hermione Granger, so loudly that some of thegirls next to her winced. “What part of that was romantic? He didn’t ask! Henever asks! He just sends ghosts after people and glues them to ceilingsand does whatever he wants with my life!”“But don’t you see?” said a fourth-year witch. “It means that eventhough he’s evil, he loves you!”“You’re not helping,” said Penelope Clearwater a little further downthe table, but she was ignored. Several older witches had started towardHermione, after she’d sat down at the extreme opposite end of the table from Harry Potter, but then a swifter cloud of younger girls had surrounded Hermione in an impenetrable barrier.“Boys,” said Hermione Granger, “should not be allowed to love girlswithout asking them first! This is true in a number of ways and especiallywhen it comes to gluing people to the ceiling!”This was also ignored. “It’s just like a play!” sighed a third-year girl.“A play?” said Hermione. “I’d like to see the play where anything likethis happens!”“Oh,” said the third-year girl, “I was thinking of that really romanticone where there’s this very nice, sweet boy who makes a Floo call, onlyhe mispronounces his destination and stumbles out into this room full1170 *of Dark Wizards who are performing a forbidden ritual that should’vestayed forever lost to time, and they’re sacrificing seven victims in orderto unseal this ancient horror which is supposed to grant someone a wishif it’s freed, so of course the boy’s presence interrupts the ritual, and as thehorror is eating all the Dark Wizards and everyone is dying the boy’s lastthought is that he wishes he could’ve had a girlfriend, and the next thingyou know the boy is lying in the lap of this beautiful woman whose eyesare burning with a dreadful light, only she doesn’t understand anythingabout being human so the boy always has to stop her eating people. Thisis just like that play, only you’re the boy and Harry Potter is the girl!”“That…” Hermione said, feeling quite surprised. “That actually doessound something like—”“It does?” blurted a second-year girl sitting across the table, who wasnow leaning forward, looking horrified and yet even more fascinated.“No!” said Hermione. “I mean—he’s not my boyfriend!”Two seconds later, Hermione’s ears caught up with what her lips hadjust said.The fourth-year witch put her hand on Hermione’s shoulder and gaveher a comforting squeeze. “Miss Granger,” she said in a soothing voice, “Ithink if you’re really honest with yourself, you’ll admit that the real reasonyou’re angry with your dark master is that he channeled his unspeakablepowers through Tracey Davis instead of you.”Hermione’s mouth opened but her throat locked up before the wordscame out, which was probably a good thing, because if she’d actuallyyelled that loudly it would’ve broken something.“How’s that possible, actually?” said the third-year girl. “I mean forHarry Potter to work through another girl even though he’s bound himself to you? Do the three of you have one of those, you know, arrangements?”“Gaaaaack,” said Hermione Granger, her throat still locked, her brainhalted, and her vocal cords spontaneously making a noise like she wascoughing up a yak.(Later.)“I don’t understand why you’re being so unreasonable,” said anothersecond-year witch, who’d replaced the third-year-girl after Hermionehad threatened to ask Tracey to eat her soul. “I mean, really, if someonelike Harry Potter rescued me, I’d be—sending him thank-you cards, andhugging him, and,” the girl’s face was a bit red, “well, kissing him, I’dhope.”“Yeah!” said the other second-year witch. “I’ve never understood whygirls in plays get angry when the main character goes out of his way to benice to them. I wouldn’t act like that if the hero liked me.”Hermione Granger had dropped her head to the dinner table, herhands slowly pulling at her hair.“You just don’t understand male psychology,” the fourth-year witchsaid in an authoritative voice. “Granger’s got to make it look like she canmysteriously resist his seductive charm.”(Even later.)And so before long Hermione Granger had turned to the only personleft she could talk to, the only person guaranteed to understand her pointof view—“They’re all mad,” said Hermione Granger as she strode vigorously toward Ravenclaw tower, having left dinner a bit early. “Everyone exceptyou and me, Harry, I mean everyone except us in this whole school of Hogwarts, they’re all entirely mad. And Ravenclaw girls are the worst, I don’tknow what Ravenclaw girls go reading when they get older, but I’m certain they ought not to be reading it. One witch asked me if the two of ushad soul-bonded, which I’m going to look up in the library tonight, butI’m pretty sure has never actually happened—”“I don’t even know a name for this kind of fallacious reasoning,” saidHarry Potter. The boy was walking normally, which meant he often had1172 *to skip forward a few steps to match her own indignation-fueled speed.“I seriously think if it was up to them, they’d be dragging us off this minuteto get our names changed to Potter-Evans-Verres-Granger… Ugh, sayingthat out loud makes me realize how awful it sounds.”“You mean your name would be Potter-Evans-Verres-Granger andmine would be Granger-Potter-Evans-Verres,” said Hermione. “It’s toohorrible to imagine.”“No,” said the boy, “House Potter is a Noble House, so I think thatname stays in front—”“What?” she said indignantly. “Who says we have to—”There was a sudden awful silence, broken only by the thuds of theirshoes.“Anyhow,” Hermione said hastily, “some of the crazy things they saidat dinner got me thinking, so I just want to say, Harry, that I really amgrateful to you for saving me and everybody from getting beat up, andeven though some parts of this afternoon upset me, I’m sure we can justtalk about it calmly.”“Ah…” Harry said with a faint and tentative smile, his eyes showing amixture of befuddlement and apprehension, “that’s… good, I guess?”To be specific, there’d been the fourth-year witch explaining that,since Harry was the evil wizard who’d fallen in love with Hermione, andHermione was the pure and innocent girl who would either redeem himor get seduced by the Dark Arts herself, it followed that Hermione had tobe perpetually indignant at anything Harry did, even if it was him heroically saving her from certain doom, just so that their romance wouldn’tresolve itself before the end of Act IV. And then Penelope Clearwater,who Hermione had really thought was smarter than that, had remarkedin a loud voice that for identical reasons it was impossible for Hermioneto just go over and talk sensibly with Harry about why she was feelinghurt, and anyway Dark Wizards were attracted to passionate defiance ina woman, not logic. This was the point at which Hermione had shovedherself up from the benches, stomped furiously over to where Harry wassitting, and asked him in a reasonable voice if the two of them could gofor a walk and sort things out.1173 *“So in other words,” Hermione said in her calmest voice ever, “you’renot really in trouble with me, I’m still talking to you, we’re still friends,and we’re still studying together. We’re not having a fight. Right?”Somehow this only seemed to increase Harry Potter’s apprehension.“Right,” said the Boy-Who-Lived.“Great!” said Hermione. “So, have you worked out why I was upset,Mr. Potter?”There was a pause. “You wanted me to keep out of your affairs?” Harrysaid cautiously. “I mean—I know you wanted to do things on your own.And I was staying out of your way, until I’d heard you’d gotten ambushedby three junior Death Eaters and, honestly, I wasn’t expecting that. Professor Quirrell wasn’t expecting that. I started to worry you’d gotten in overyour head and then, no offense Hermione, forty-four bullies in a massedambush is way beyond what anyone could handle without help. That’s whyI thought you really needed help just that once—”“No, that part’s fine,” said Hermione. “We were in over our heads, honestly. Please guess again, Mr. Potter.”“Um,” said Harry. “What Tracey did… startled you?”“Startled me, Mr. Potter?” There might have been a touch of acidityin her voice. “No, Mr. Potter, I was scared. I was frightened. I wouldn’twant to admit to being afraid of just dragons or something, people mightthink I was cowardly, but when you can hear distant voices crying ‘Tekelili! Tekeli-li!’ and there’s pools of blood seeping out from under all thedoors, then it’s okay to be scared.”“I am sorry,” Harry said with what sounded like genuine regret. “Ithought you’d realize it was me.”“And the reason we all got scared like that, Mr. Potter, was that youdidn’t ask first!” Despite her intentions, Hermione found her voice wasrising again. “You should’ve asked me before you did something like that,Harry! You should’ve said very specifically, ‘Hermione, can I make bloodcome out from under the doors?’ It’s important to be specific when you’reasking about that sort of thing!”The boy rubbed the back of his neck as he walked. “I… honestly, I justthought you’d have to say no.”1174 *“Yes, Mr. Potter, I could’ve said no. That’s the whole point of asking first,Mr. Potter!”“No, I mean you’d have had to say no, whether or not it was what you really wanted. And then all of you would’ve gotten beaten up and it would’vebeen my fault for asking first.”Hermione’s eyebrows went up in a bit of surprise, and she kept walking for a few steps while she tried to understand this. “What?” she said.“Well…” the boy said a bit slowly. “I mean… you’re the Sunshine General, aren’t you? You couldn’t say yes to me scaring people, not even bullies,not even to save your friends from getting beaten up. You would’ve had tosay no, and then you would’ve gotten hurt. This way, you can tell peoplehonestly that you had no idea and that it wasn’t your fault. That’s why Ididn’t warn you.”Hermione stopped walking, turned to face Harry full on instead ofjust turning her head. Her voice was carefully even as she said, “Harry,you’ve got to stop coming up with clever reasons for doing stupid things.”Harry’s eyebrows flew up. After a moment he said, “Look… I knowwhat you mean, of course, but there’s still the question of whether it’sactually is a good idea, not just a clever one—”“I understand why you did what you did today,” Hermione said. “ButI want you to promise that from now on, you’ll ask me first, always, evenif you can come up with a reason why you shouldn’t.”There was a pause that stretched, and Hermione could feel her heartsinking.“Hermione—” Harry started to say.“Why?” The frustration burst out into her voice. “Why is it so awful? Allyou have to do is ask!”Harry’s eyes were very serious. “Who in sphew do you try hardest todefend, Hermione? Who are you most afraid for, when you fight?”“Hannah Abbott,” Hermione said without having to think about it,and then felt a little bad, because Hannah was trying hard and she hadimproved a lot—“Would you feel okay about trusting someone else, like Tracey, with final responsibility for protecting Hannah? If you knew Hannah was aboutto walk into an ambush, and you came up with a plan for protecting her,1175 *would you feel good about letting Tracey say whether or not you were allowed to do it?”“Well… no?” said Hermione, puzzled.The green eyes of the Boy-Who-Lived were steady on hers. “Wouldyou trust Hannah to have the final say in whether she needed protecting?”“I—” said Hermione, and then paused. It was strange, she knew theright answer and she also knew the right answer wasn’t actually true.Hannah was trying so hard to prove she wasn’t afraid, even though shewas, and it was easy to see how the Hufflepuff girl might try too hard—Then Hermione realized the implication. “You think I’m like Hannah?”“Not… exactly…” Harry ran his hands through his mess of hair. “Listen,Hermione, what would you have suggested doing, if I’d warned you aboutan ambush by forty-four bullies?”“I would’ve done the responsible thing and told Professor McGonagalland let her take care of it,” Hermione said promptly. “And then therewouldn’t have been darkness and people screaming and horrible bluelight—”But Harry just shook his head. “That’s not the responsible thing todo, Hermione. It’s what someone playing the role of a responsible girlwould do. Yes, I thought of going to Professor McGonagall. But shewould’ve only stopped the disaster once. Probably before any disturbancehappened in the first place, like by telling the bullies she knew. If thebullies got punished just for plotting, it would be by losing House points,or at worst a day’s detention, not anything that would really scare them.And then the bullies would have tried again. Fewer of them, with betteroperational security so I didn’t hear about it. They would probably ambush one of you, alone. Professor McGonagall doesn’t have the authorityto do something scary enough to protect you—and she wouldn’t haveoverstepped her authority, because she’s not really responsible.”“Professor McGonagall isn’t responsible?” Hermione said incredulously.She jammed her hands on her hips, now openly glaring at him. “Are younuts?”The boy didn’t blink. “You could call it heroic responsibility, maybe,”Harry Potter said. “Not like the usual sort. It means that whatever hap*1176 *pens, no matter what, it’s always your fault. Even if you tell ProfessorMcGonagall, she’s not responsible for what happens, you are. Followingthe school rules isn’t an excuse, someone else being in charge isn’t an excuse, even trying your best isn’t an excuse. There just aren’t any excuses,you’ve got to get the job done no matter what.” Harry’s face tightened. “That’swhy I say you’re not thinking responsibly, Hermione. Thinking that yourjob is done when you tell Professor McGonagall—that isn’t heroine thinking. Like Hannah being beat up is okay then, because it isn’t your fault anymore. Being a heroine means your job isn’t finished until you’ve donewhatever it takes to protect the other girls, permanently.” In Harry’s voicewas a touch of the steel he had acquired since the day Fawkes had been onhis shoulder. “You can’t think as if just following the rules means you’vedone your duty.”“I think,” Hermione said evenly, “that you and I might disagree aboutsome things, Mr. Potter. Like whether you or Professor McGonagall ismore responsible, and whether being responsible usually involves peoplerunning around and screaming, and how much it’s a good idea to followschool rules. And just because we disagree, Mr. Potter, doesn’t mean thatyou get the final say.”“Well,” said Harry, “you asked what was so awful about having to askyou first, and it was a surprisingly good question, so I examined my mindand that’s what I found. I think my real fear is that if Hannah is in troubleand I come up with a way to save her that seems weird or dark or something, you might not weigh the consequences to Hannah. You might notaccept the heroine’s responsibility of coming up with some way to saveher, somehow, no matter what. Instead you’d just carry out the role ofHermione Granger, the sensible Ravenclaw girl; and the role of Hermione Granger automatically says no, whether or not she has a better planin mind. And then forty-four bullies will take turns beating up HannahAbbott, and it’ll all be my fault because I knew, even if I didn’t want realityto be that way, I knew that was how it would go. I’m pretty sure that wasmy secret, wordless, unutterable fear.”The frustration was building up inside her again. “It’s my life!” Hermione burst out. She could imagine what it would be like with Harry messing with her all the time, constantly inventing justifications not to ask1177 *her first and not to listen to her objections. She shouldn’t have to win anargument just to—“There’ll always be some reason, you can always say I’mnot thinking right! I want my own life! Otherwise I’ll walk away, I reallywill, I mean it Harry.”Harry sighed. “This is exactly where I didn’t want things to end up,and here we are. You’re afraid of just the same thing I am, aren’t you?Afraid that if you let go of the steering wheel, we’ll crash.” The corners ofhis lips twisted, but it didn’t look like a real smile. “That’s something I canunderstand.”“I don’t think you understand at all!” Hermione said sharply. “Yousaid we’d be partners, Harry!”That stopped him, she could see it stop him.“How about this?” Harry said at last. “I’ll promise to ask you first before I do anything that could be interpreted as meddling in your affairs.Only you’ve got to promise me to be reasonable, Hermione. I mean really,genuinely, stop and think for twenty seconds first, treat it as a real choice.The sort of reasonableness where you realize I’m offering a way to protectthe other girls, and that if you automatically say no without consideringit properly, there’s this actual consequence where Hannah Abbott ends upin the hospital.”Hermione stared at Harry, as his recitation wound down.“Well?” said Harry.“I shouldn’t have to make promises,” she said, “just to be consultedabout my own life.” She turned from Harry and began walking toward theRavenclaw tower, not looking at him. “But I’ll think about it, anyway.”She heard Harry sigh, and after that they walked in silence for a while,passing through an archway of some reddish metal like copper, into acorridor that was just like the one they’d left except that it was tiled inpentagons instead of squares.“Hermione…” said Harry. “I’ve been watching you and thinking, sincethe day you said you were going to be a hero. You’ve got the courage. You’llfight for what’s right, even in the face of enemies that would scare otherpeople away. You’ve certainly got the raw intelligence for it, and you’reprobably a better person inside than I am. But even so… well, to be hon*1178 *est, Hermione… I can’t quite see you filling Dumbledore’s shoes, leadingmagical Britain’s fight against You-Know-Who. Not yet, anyway.”Hermione had turned her head to stare at Harry, who just went onwalking, as though lost in thought. Fill those shoes? She’d never tried toimagine herself that way. She’d never imagined imagining herself thatway.“And maybe I’m wrong,” Harry said as they walked. “Maybe I’ve justread too many stories where the heroes never do the sensible thing andfollow the rules and tell their Professor McGonagalls, so my brain doesn’tthink you’re a proper storybook hero. Maybe it’s you who’s the sane one,Hermione, and me who’s just being silly. But every time you talk about following rules or relying on teachers, I get that same feeling, like it’s boundup with this one last thing that’s stopping you, one last thing that putsyour PC self to sleep and turns you into an NPC again…” Harry let out asigh. “Maybe that’s why Dumbledore said I should have wicked stepparents.”“He said what?”Harry nodded. “I still don’t know whether the Headmaster was jokingor… the thing is, he was right in a way. I had loving parents, but I never feltlike I could trust their decisions, they weren’t sane enough. I always knewthat if I didn’t think things through myself, I might get hurt. ProfessorMcGonagall will do whatever it takes to get the job done if I’m there tonag her about it, she doesn’t break rules on her own without heroic supervision. Professor Quirrell really is someone who gets things done nomatter what, and he’s the only other person I know who notices stuff likethe Snitch ruining Quidditch. But him I can’t trust to be good. Even if it’ssad, I think that’s part of the environment that creates what Dumbledorecalls a hero—people who don’t have anyone else to shove final responsibility onto, and that’s why they form the mental habit of tracking everythingthemselves.”Hermione didn’t say anything to that, but she was thinking back tosomething Godric Gryffindor had written near the end of his very shortautobiography. Briefly and without any explanation, because the scrollhad been meant to be copied by hand, centuries before the Muggle printing press had inspired wizards to invent the Reading-Writing Quill.1179 *No rescuer hath the rescuer, Godric Gryffindor had written. No Lord haththe champion, no mother and no father, only nothingness above.If that was the price of being a hero, Hermione wasn’t sure she wantedto pay it. Or maybe—though it wasn’t the sort of thing she would havethought, before she started hanging around Harry—maybe Godric Gryffindor had gotten it wrong.“Do you trust Dumbledore?” Hermione said. “I mean, he’s right herein our school and he’s the most legendary hero in the whole world—”“He was the most legendary hero,” said Harry. “Now he sets chickenson fire. Honestly, does Dumbledore seem reliable to you?”Hermione didn’t answer.Side by side, the two of them began to climb huge wide spiral stairs,the steps alternating between bronze metal and blue stone; the final approach to where the Ravenclaw portrait waited to guard their dorm withsilly riddles.“Oh, and I just thought of something I should tell you,” Harry saidwhen they were about halfway up. “Since it affects your life and all. Thinkof it as a sort of down payment—”“What is it?” said Hermione.“I predict sphew is about to retire.”“Retire?” Hermione said, almost stumbling on one of the stairs.“Yeah,” Harry said. “I mean, I could be wrong, but I suspect the teachers are about to clamp down hard on fighting in the corridors.” Harrywas grinning as he spoke, a glint in his eyes behind the glasses hinting atsecret knowledge. “Cast new wards to detect offensive hexes, or start verifying reports of bullying using Veritaserum—I can think of several waysthey might shut it down. But if I’m right, it’s something to celebrate, Hermione, you and all of you. You kicked up enough public ruckus that yougot them to actually do something about the bullying. All the bullying.”Slowly, then, a smile began to creep up her lips, and as she reached thetop of the stairs and began walking toward the Ravenclaw portrait for herriddle, Hermione felt rather lighter on her feet, a wonderful lifting feelingspreading through her like she’d been pumped full of helium.Somehow, despite all the effort the eight of them had put in, shehadn’t expected that much, she hadn’t expected it to actually work.They’d made a difference…It was the end of breakfast-time on the next morning.The students from every year sat very still in their benches, all headsturned in the same direction, toward the Head Table, before which onelone first-year girl stood rigid and motionless, her head tilted back tostare up at the Head of House Slytherin.Professor Snape’s face was twisted with fury and triumph, vindictiveas any painting of a Dark Wizard; and behind him the other Professorssat at the Head Table, watching with faces as though carved from stone.“—permanently disbanded,” spat the Potions Master. “Your selfproclaimed Society is outlawed within Hogwarts, by my decision as aProfessor! If your Society or any member of it is discovered fighting inthe hallways again, Granger, you will be personally held responsible andexpelled, by me, from the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!”That first-year girl stood there, before the Head Table where she’dbeen called before only to receive commendations and smiles; stood therewith her spine held tall and upright in its curve like a centaur’s bow, giving nothing to the enemy.That first-year witch stood there with all tears and anger bottled, herface still, nothing changing of her outward appearance, while somethingslowly broke inside her, she could feel it breaking.It broke further when Professor Snape gave her two weeks detentionfor the crime of violence in school, sneering with the contemptuous facehe’d shown them all on the first day of Potions, and with a little twist inthe corner of his smile that said the Potions Master knew exactly how unfair he was being.Whatever-it-was inside her cracked all the way through, from top tobottom, when Professor Snape took one hundred points from Ravenclaw.It ended, then, and Snape told her she was dismissed.She turned around and saw that at the Ravenclaw table, Harry Potterwas sitting still in his place, she couldn’t see his expression from here, shesaw his fists on the table but she couldn’t see if they were clenched white1181 *like her own. She had whispered to him, when Professor Snape had calledher, that he wasn’t to do anything without asking first.Hermione wheeled back again to look at the Head Table, just as Snapewas turning away from her to resume his place.“I said you’re dismissed, girl,” said the sneering voice, but therewas a pleased smile on Snape’s face, like he was waiting for her to dosomething—Hermione strode forward another five steps toward the Head Tableand said in a breaking voice, “Headmaster?”Utter silence filled the Great Hall.Headmaster Dumbledore said nothing, didn’t move. It was as thoughhe, too, was just carved from stone.Hermione turned her gaze to look at Professor Flitwick, whose head,barely visible above the table, seemed to be staring down into his lap. Beside him, Professor Sprout’s face was very tight, she seemed to be forcingherself to watch, and her lips were trembling, but she said nothing.Professor McGonagall’s chair was empty, the Deputy Headmistresshadn’t shown up to breakfast that morning.“Why aren’t any of you saying anything?” said Hermione Granger.Her voice was trembling with the last of her hope, the last desperate reachfor help from that place inside her. “You know what he’s doing is wrong!”“Two more weeks’ detention, for insolence,” Snape said silkily.It shattered.She looked at the Head Table for a few seconds longer, at ProfessorFlitwick and Professor Sprout and the empty place where Professor McGonagall should’ve been. Then Hermione Granger turned and began walking toward the Ravenclaw table.There was a babble of voices starting up, as the students came unfrozen from where they’d sat.And then, as she was almost to the Ravenclaw table—The dry voice of Professor Quirrell cut through everything, and thatvoice said, “One hundred points to Miss Granger for doing what is right.”Hermione almost fell over her own feet; and then she continued forward, even as Snape shouted something furious, even as Professor Quirrell leaned back in his chair and began to laugh, even as Dumbledore’s1182 *voice was saying something she didn’t catch and then she was sittingdown at the Ravenclaw table again next to Harry Potter.Harry Potter was frozen beside her, he looked like someone whodidn’t dare move.“It’s all right,” her voice said to him, automatically without there being any choice or thought involved, although really it wasn’t right at all.“But can you see if you can get me out of Snape’s detentions, like you didyourself that time?”Harry Potter nodded, a single jerky motion of his head. “I—” saidHarry. “I—I’m sorry, this—this is all my fault—”“Don’t be ridiculous, Harry.” It was odd how her voice was comingout all normal, and without her thinking about what to say. Hermionelooked down at her breakfast plate, but eating seemed to be clearly out ofthe question, there was a roiling and churning in her stomach which suggested that she was already on the verge of throwing up, which was oddbecause she could have sworn her whole body felt numb, like she wasn’tfeeling anything, at the same time.“And,” her voice said, “if you want to break school rules or something,you can ask me about it, I promise I won’t just say no.”Non est salvatori salvator,neque defensori dominus,nec pater nec mater,nihil supernum.—Godric Gryffindor,1183 *Aftermath: Albus Dumbledore and—he old wizard sat alone at his desk, in the unsilence of the Headmaster’s office, amid the innumerable and unnoticed devices; his robesa gentle yellow, of soft fabric, not such clothing as he ordinarily wore before others. His wrinkled hand held a quill scratching away at an officiallooking parchment. If you had somehow been there to watch his linedface, you would have been unable to deduce anything more about theman himself than you understood of the enigmatic devices. You mighthave observed that the face looked a little sad, a little tired, but then Albus Dumbledore always looked like that when he was alone.In the Floo hearth there were only scattered ashes without a hint offlame, a magical door that had been shut so solidly as to stop existing.On the material plane, the great oaken door to the office had been closedand locked; beyond that door, the Endless Stairs stayed motionless; atthe bottom of those stairs, the gargoyles that blocked the entrance didnot flow, their pseudo-life withdrawn to leave solid rock.Then, even as the quill was in the middle of penning a word, even asit was in the middle of scratching a letter—The old wizard shot to his feet with a speed that would have shockedanyone watching, abandoning the quill in mid-letter to fall onto the1185 *parchment; like lightning he spun on the oaken door, his yellow robeswhirling around him and a wand of dread power leaping into his hand—And as abruptly, the old wizard paused, halting his motion even as thewand came to bear.A hand struck upon the oaken door, three times knocking.More slowly, now, that grim wand went back into the dueling holsterstrapped beneath the old wizard’s sleeve. The ancient man moved forward a few paces, drew himself up into a more formal stance, composedhis face. Nearby upon the desk, the quill moved to the side of the parchment, as though it had been carefully placed there rather than droppedin haste; and the parchment itself flipped over to show blankness.With a silent twitch of his will, the oaken door swung open.Hard as stones, the green eyes glared at him.“I admit that I am impressed, Harry,” the old wizard said quietly. “TheCloak of Invisibility would have let you evade my lesser means of vision;but I did not sense my golems step aside, nor the stairs turning. How didyou come here?”The boy walked into the office, step by deliberate step until the doorclosed smoothly behind him. “I can go anywhere I choose, with or without permission,” that boy said. His voice seemed calm; too calm, perhaps.“I am in your office because I decided to be here, and to hell with passwords. You are greatly mistaken, Headmaster Dumbledore, if you thinkthat I stay in this school because I am a prisoner here. I simply have notchosen, yet, to leave. Now keeping that in mind, why did you commandyour agent, Professor Snape, to break the agreement we made in this office, that he would not torment any student in her fourth year or below?”The old wizard looked at the angry young hero for a long moment.Then, slowly enough not to alarm the boy, those wizened fingers drewopen one of the manifold drawers of the desk, lifted out a sheet of parchment, laid it upon the desk. “Fourteen,” the old wizard said. “It is not thenumber of all the owls sent last night. Only the owls sent to families witha seat on the Wizengamot, or families of great wealth, or families alreadyallied with your foes. Or, in the case of Robert Jugson, all three; for hisfather, Lord Jugson, is a Death Eater, and his grandfather a Death Eaterwho died by Alastor Moody’s wand. What the letters said, I do not know,1186 *but I can guess. Do you still not understand, Harry Potter? Each timeHermione Granger won, as you put it, the danger to her from Slytheringrew again, and yet again. But now the Slytherins have triumphed overher, easily and safely, without violence or lasting harm. They have won,and need fight no more…” The old wizard sighed. “So I had planned. So Ihad hoped. So it would have been, if the Defense Professor had not takenit upon himself to intervene. Now the dispute goes to the Board of Governors, where Severus will seem to conquer the Defense Professor; butthat will not feel the same to the Slytherins, it will not have been over andfinished in a moment, to their satisfaction.”The boy advanced further into the room, his head tilting back furtherto look up at the half-moon glasses; and somehow it was like the boy waslooking down at the Headmaster, rather than up. “So this Lord Jugsonis a Death Eater?” the boy said softly. “Good. His life is already boughtand paid for, then, and I can do anything I want to him without ethicalproblems—”“Harry!”The boy’s voice was clear as ice, frozen of purest water from some untouched spring. “You seem to think that the Light should live in fear ofthe darkness. I say it should be the other way around. I’d prefer not tokill this Lord Jugson, even if he is a Death Eater. But one hour of brainstorming with the Defense Professor would be plenty of time to come upwith some creative way to wreck him financially, or get him exiled frommagical Britain. That would serve to make the point, I think.”“I confess,” the old wizard said slowly, “that the thought of ruininga five-hundred-year-old House, and challenging a Death Eater to war tothe finish, over a scuffle in a Hogwarts hallway, had not occurred to me,Harry.” The old wizard lifted a finger to push back his half-moon glassesfrom where they had slid a little down his nose, during his sudden motion earlier. “I daresay it would not occur to Miss Granger either, nor toProfessor McGonagall, nor to Fred and George.”The boy shrugged. “It wouldn’t be about the hallways,” the boy said.“It would be justice for his past crimes, and I’d only do it if Jugson madethe first move. The point isn’t to make people scared of me as a wild card,after all. It’s to teach them that neutrals are perfectly safe from me, and1187 *poking me with a stick is incredibly dangerous.” The boy smiled in a waythat didn’t reach his eyes. “Maybe I’ll buy an ad in the Daily Prophet, saying that anyone who wants to carry on this dispute with me will learn thetrue meaning of Chaos, but anyone who leaves me alone will be fine.”“No,” the old wizard said. His voice was deeper now, showing something of his true age and power. “No, Harry, that must not be. You havenot yet learned the meaning of fighting, what truly happens when foesmeet in battle. And so you dream, as young boys do, of teaching yourfoes to fear you. It frightens me that you, at far too young an age, mightalready have enough power to make some part of your dreams into reality. There is no turning of that road which does not lead into darkness,Harry, none. That is the way of a Dark Lord, for certain.”The boy hesitated, then, and his eyes flickered to the empty goldenplatform where Fawkes sometimes rested his wings. It was a gesture thatfew would have caught, but the old wizard knew it very well.“All right, forget the part about teaching them to fear me,” the boysaid then. His voice was no less hard, but some of the cold had gone fromit. “I still don’t think you should let children get hurt out of fear of whatsomeone like Lord Jugson might do. Protecting them is the whole pointof your job. If Lord Jugson really does try to get in your way, then dowhatever it takes to stop him. Give me full access to my vaults, and I’ll takepersonal responsibility for dealing with any fallout from banning bulliesin Hogwarts, whether it’s Lord Jugson or anyone else.”Slowly the old wizard shook his head. “You seem to think, Harry, thatI need merely use my full power, and all foes will be swept aside. You arewrong. Lucius Malfoy controls Minister Fudge, through the Daily Prophethe sways all Britain, only by bare margins does he not control enoughof the Board of Governors to oust me from Hogwarts. Amelia Bones andBartemius Crouch are allies, but even they would step aside if they saw usacting wantonly. The world that surrounds you is more fragile than youseem to believe, and we must walk with greater care. The old WizardingWar never ended, Harry, it only continued in a different form; the blackking slept, and Lucius Malfoy moved his chesspieces for a time. Do youthink Lucius Malfoy would lightly permit you to take a pawn of his color?”The boy smiled, now with a touch of coldness again. “Okay, I’ll figureout some way to set it up so that it looks like Lord Jugson betrayed hisown side.”“Harry—”“Obstacles mean you get creative, Headmaster. It doesn’t mean youabandon the children you’re supposed to protect. Let the Light win, andif trouble comes of it—” The boy shrugged. “Let Light win again.”“So might phoenixes speak, if they had words,” the old wizard said.“But you do not understand the phoenix’s price.”The last two words were spoken in a peculiarly clear voice that seemedto echo around the office, and then a huge rumbling noise seemed tocome from all around them.Between the ancient shield on the wall and the Sorting Hat’s hatrack,the stone of the walls began to flow and move, pouring itself into twoframing columns and revealing a gap between them, an opening thatshowed a set of stone stairs leading upward into darkness.The old wizard turned and strode toward those stairs, and thenlooked back at where Harry Potter stood. “Come!” said the old wizard.There was no twinkle now in those blue eyes. “Since you have alreadygone so far as to force your way here uninvited, you may as well gofurther.”There were no railings on those stone steps, and after the first few stepsHarry drew his wand and cast Lumos. The Headmaster did not look back,did not seem to be looking downward, as though he had climbed the stepsoften enough to have no need of vision.The boy knew that he should have been curious, or frightened, butthere was no spare brain capacity for that. It was taking all his control notto let the fury simmering inside him boil over any further than it alreadyhad.The stairs went on for only a short distance, one straight rising flightwithout turns or curves.At the top was a door of solid metal, looking black in the blue lightcast from Harry’s wand, meaning that the metal itself was either black orperhaps red.Albus Dumbledore lifted up his long wand like a brandished symbol,and again spoke in that strange voice which seemed to echo in Harry’sears, as though burning itself into his memory: “Phoenix’s fate.”That last door opened, and Harry followed Dumbledore inside.The room beyond seemed to be made of black metal like the door thatled to it. The walls were black, the floor was black. The ceiling above wasblack, but for a single globe of crystal that hung down from the ceilingon a white chain, and shone with a brilliant silver light that looked likeit had been cast in imitation of Patronus light, though you could tell itwasn’t the real thing.Within the room were pedestals of black metal, each bearing a moving picture, or an upright cylinder half-filled with some faintly shiningsilver liquid, or a lone small object; a scorched silver necklace, a crushedhat, an untouched golden wedding ring. Many pedestals bore all three,the moving picture and the silver liquid and the item. There seemed tobe a good many wizards’ wands upon those pedestals, and many of thosewands were broken, or burned, or looked like the wood had somehowmelted.It took that long for Harry to realize what he was seeing, and thenhis throat suddenly choked; it was like the rage inside him had been hit ahammerblow, maybe the hardest hammerblow of his entire existence.“These are not all the fallen of all my wars,” Albus Dumbledore said.His back was to Harry, only his grey locks and yellowish robes showed.“Not even nearly all of them. Only my closest friends, and those who diedof my worst decisions, there is something of them here. Those I regretmost of all, this is their place.”Harry couldn’t count how many pedestals were in the room. It mighthave been around a hundred. The room of black metal was not small, andthere was clearly more space left in it for future pedestals.Albus Dumbledore turned and regarded Harry, the deep blue eyes setlike steel in his brow, but his voice, when he spoke, was calm. “It seemsto me that you know nothing of the phoenix’s price,” Albus Dumbledoresaid quietly. “It seems to me that you are not an evil person, but mostterribly ignorant, and confident in your ignorance; as I once was, a longtime ago. Yet I have never heard Fawkes so clearly as you seemed to, thatday. Perhaps I was already too old and full of grief, when my phoenixcame to me. If there is something I do not understand, about how readyI should be to fight, then tell me of this wisdom.” There was no anger inthe old wizard’s voice; the impact that drove out your breath like fallingoff a broomstick was all in the scorched and shattered wands, gleaminggently in their death beneath the silver light. “Or else turn and go fromthis place, but then I wish to hear no more of it.”Harry didn’t know what to say. There had been nothing in his own lifethat was like this, and all the words seemed to fall away. He would findsomething to say if he looked, but he couldn’t believe, in that moment,that the words would be meaningful. You shouldn’t be able to win anypossible argument, just from people having died of your decisions, andyet even knowing that it felt like there was nothing to be said. That therewas nothing Harry had any right to say.And Harry almost did turn and go from that place, except for the understanding which came to him then: that there was probably a part ofAlbus Dumbledore which always stood in this place, always, no matterwhere he was. And that if you stood in a place like this you could do anything, lose anything, if it meant that you didn’t have to fight another time.One of the pedestals caught Harry’s eye; the photograph on it did notmove, did not smile or wave, it was a Muggle photograph of a womanlooking seriously at the camera, her brown hair twisted into braids of anordinary Muggle style that Harry hadn’t seen on any witch. There was acylinder of silvery liquid beside the photograph, but no object; no meltedring or broken wand.Harry walked forward, slowly, until he stood before the pedestal.“Who was she?” Harry said, his voice sounding strange in his own ears.“Her name was Tricia Glasswell,” said Dumbledore. “The motherof a Muggleborn daughter, who the Death Eaters killed. She was a detective of the Muggle government, and after that she fed informationfrom the Muggle authorities to the Order of the Phoenix, until she was—betrayed—into the hands of Voldemort.” There was a catch in the old1191 *wizard’s voice. “She did not die well, Harry.”“Did she save lives?” Harry said.“Yes,” the wizard said quietly. “She did.”Harry lifted his gaze from the pedestal to look at Dumbledore.“Would the world be a better place if she hadn’t fought?”“No, it would not,” said the old wizard. His voice was tired, and grieving. He seemed more bent now, as though he were folding in on himself.“I see that you still do not understand. I think you will not understand until the day that you—oh, Harry. So very long ago, when I was not mucholder than you are now, I learned the true face of violence, and its cost. Tofill the air with deadly curses—for any reason—for any reason, Harry—itis an ill thing, and its nature is corrupted, as terrible as the darkest rituals. Violence, once begun, becomes like a Lethifold that strikes at any lifenear it. I… would spare you that lesson the way I learned it, Harry.”Harry looked away from the blue eyes, cast his gaze down at the blackmetal of the floor. The Headmaster was trying to tell him something important, that was clear; and it wasn’t something that Harry thought wasstupid, either.“There was a Muggle once named Mohandas Gandhi,” Harry said tothe floor. “He thought the government of Muggle Britain shouldn’t ruleover his country. And he refused to fight. He convinced his whole countrynot to fight. Instead he told his people to walk up to the British soldiersand let themselves be struck down, without resisting, and when Britaincouldn’t stand doing that any more, we freed his country. I thought it wasa very beautiful thing, when I read about it, I thought it was somethinghigher than all the wars that anyone had ever fought with guns or swords.That they’d really done that, and that it had actually worked.” Harry drewanother breath. “Only then I found out that Gandhi told his people, during World War II, that if the Nazis invaded they should use nonviolentresistance against them, too. But the Nazis would’ve just shot everyonein sight. And maybe Winston Churchill always felt that there should’vebeen a better way, some clever way to win without having to hurt anyone; but he never found it, and so he had to fight.” Harry looked up atthe Headmaster, who was staring at him. “Winston Churchill was theone who tried to convince the British government not to give Czechoslo*1192 *vakia to Hitler in exchange for a peace treaty, that they should fight rightaway—”“I recognize the name, Harry,” said Dumbledore. The old wizard’slips twitched upward. “Although honesty compels me to say that dearWinston was never one for pangs of conscience, even after a dozen shotsof Firewhiskey.”“The point is,” Harry said, after a brief pause to remember exactly whohe was talking to, and fight down the suddenly returning sense that hewas an ignorant child gone insane with audacity who had no right to bein this room and no right to question Albus Dumbledore about anything,“the point is, saying violence is evil isn’t an answer. It doesn’t say when tofight and when not to fight. It’s a hard question and Gandhi refused todeal with it, and that’s why I lost some of my respect for him.”“And your own answer, Harry?” Dumbledore said quietly.“One answer is that you shouldn’t ever use violence except to stop violence,” Harry said. “You shouldn’t risk anyone’s life except to save evenmore lives. It sounds good when you say it like that. Only the problem isthat if a police officer sees a burglar robbing a house, the police officershould try to stop the burglar, even though the burglar might fight backand someone might get hurt or even killed. Even if the burglar is onlytrying to steal jewelry, which is just a thing. Because if nobody so muchas inconveniences burglars, there will be more burglars, and more burglars.And even if they only ever stole things each time, it would—the fabric ofsociety—” Harry stopped. His thoughts weren’t as ordered as they usuallypretended to be, in this room. He should have been able to give some perfectly logical exposition in terms of game theory, should have at least beenable to see it that way, but it was eluding him. Hawks and doves—“Don’tyou see, if evil people are willing to risk violence to get what they want,and good people always back down because violence is too terrible to risk,it‘s—it’s not a good society to live in, Headmaster! Don’t you realize whatall this bullying is doing to Hogwarts, to Slytherin House most of all?”“War is too terrible to risk,” the old wizard said. “And yet it will come.Voldemort is returning. The black chesspieces are gathering. Severus isone of the most important pieces our own side possesses, in that war. Butour evil Potions Master must, as the saying goes, keep up appearances. If1193 *Severus can pay that keep by hurting the feelings of children, only theirfeelings, Harry,” the old wizard’s voice was very soft, “you would have tobe most terribly innocent in the ways of war, to think he had made a poorbargain. Hard decisions do not look like that, Harry. They look—like this.”The old wizard did not gesture. He simply stood where he was, among thepedestals.“You shouldn’t be Headmaster,” Harry said through the burning inhis throat. “I’m sorry, I’m so sorry, but you shouldn’t try to be a schoolprincipal and run a war at the same time. Hogwarts shouldn’t be part ofthis.”“The children will survive,” the old wizard said with tired old eyes.“They would not survive Voldemort. Have you wondered why the children of Hogwarts do not speak much of their parents, Harry? It is because there is always, within earshot, someone who has lost their motheror father or both. That is what Voldemort left behind, the last time hecame. Nothing is worth that war beginning again even one day earlierthan it must, or lasting one day longer than it must.” The old wizard didgesture now, as though to indicate all the shattered wands. “We did notfight because it seemed righteous to do so! We fought when we had to,when there was no other way left. That was our answer.”“Is that why you waited so long to confront Grindelwald?”Harry had uttered the question without quite thinking—There was a slow time while the blue eyes searched him.“Who have you been talking to, Harry?” said the old wizard. “No, donot answer. I already know.” Dumbledore sighed. “Many have asked methat question, and always I have turned them aside. Yet in time you mustlearn the full truth of that matter. Will you swear never to speak of it toanother, until I give you leave?”Harry would have liked to be allowed to tell Draco, but—“I swear,”Harry said.“Grindelwald possessed an ancient and terrible device,” said Dumbledore. “While he held it, I could not break his defense. In our duel I couldnot win, only fight him for long hours until he fell in exhaustion; and Iwould have died of it afterward, if not for Fawkes. But while his Muggle allies yet made blood sacrifice to sustain him, Grindelwald would not1194 *have fallen. He was, during that time, truly invincible. Of that grim device which Grindelwald held, none must know, none must suspect, theremust be not a single hint. And therefore you must not speak of it, and Iwill say no more for now. That is all, Harry. There is no moral to it, andno wisdom. That is all there is.”Harry slowly nodded. It wasn’t entirely implausible, by the standardsof magic…“And then,” Dumbledore’s voice went on, even quieter, almost asthough he were speaking to himself, “since it was I who felled him,they obeyed me when I said he should not die, though they cried by thethousands for his blood. So he was imprisoned in Nurmengard, in theprison that he built, and he abides there until this day. I went to thatduel without any intent to kill him, Harry. Because, you see, I had triedto kill Grindelwald once before, a long time ago, and that… that was… itproved to be… a mistake, Harry…” The old wizard was staring now at hislong dark-grey wand where he held it in both hands, as though it were acrystal ball out of Muggle fantasy, a scrying pool within which answerscould be found. “And I thought, then… I thought that I should never kill.And then came Voldemort.”The old wizard looked back up at Harry, and said, in a hoarse voice,“He is not like Grindelwald, Harry. There is nothing human left in him.Him you must destroy. You must not hesitate, when the time comes. Tohim alone, of all the creatures in this world, you must show no mercy;and when you are done you must forget it, forget that you ever did sucha thing, and go back to living. Save your fury for that, and that alone.”In that office there was silence.It lasted for some many long seconds, and finally was broken by a single question.“Are there Dementors in Nurmengard?”“What?” said the old wizard. “No! I would not have done that even tohim—”1195 *The old wizard stared at the young boy, who had straightened, and hisface changed.“In other words,” the boy said, as though talking to himself withoutany other people in the room, “it’s already known how to keep powerful Dark Wizards in prison, without using Dementors. People know theyknow that.”“Harry…?”“No,” the boy said. The boy looked up, and his eyes were blazing likegreen fire. “I do not accept your answer, Headmaster. Fawkes gave me amission, and I know now why Fawkes gave that mission to me, and notto you. You are willing to accept balances of power where the bad guysend up winning. I am not.”“That too is not an answer,” the old wizard said; his face showed nothing of his hurt, he had long practice in concealing pain. “Refusing to accept something does not change it. I wonder now if you are simply tooyoung to understand this matter, Harry, despite your outward airs; onlyin children’s fantasies can all battles be won, and not a single evil tolerated.”“And that’s why I can destroy Dementors and you can’t,” said the boy.“Because I believe that the darkness can be broken.”The old wizard’s breath stopped in his throat.“The phoenix’s price isn’t inevitable,” the boy said. “It’s not part ofsome deep balance built into the universe. It’s just the parts of the problem where you haven’t figured out yet how to cheat.”The old wizard’s lips parted, and no words came forth.Silver light falling on shattered wands.“Fawkes gave me a mission,” the boy repeated, “and I will carry outthat mission if I must break the entire Ministry to do it. That’s the partof the answer that you’re missing. You don’t stop and say, oh well, guessI can’t possibly figure out any way to stop bullying in Hogwarts, and leave itat that. You just keep looking until you figure out how to do it. If thatrequires breaking Lucius Malfoy’s entire conspiracy, fine.”“And the true fight, the fight against Voldemort?” the old wizard saidin an unsteady voice. “What will you do to win that, Harry? Will you breakthe whole world? Even if someday you gain such power, you are not yet1196 *beyond prices, and perhaps you never will be! For you to act this way nowis nothing short of madness!”“I asked Professor Quirrell why he’d laughed,” the boy said evenly, “after he awarded Hermione those hundred points. And Professor Quirrellsaid, these aren’t his exact words, but it’s pretty much what he said, thathe’d found it tremendously amusing that the great and good Albus Dumbledore had been sitting there doing nothing as this poor innocent girlbegged for help, while he had been the one to defend her. And he toldme then that by the time good and moral people were done tying themselves up in knots, what they usually did was nothing; or, if they did act,you could hardly tell them apart from the people called bad. Whereas hecould help innocent girls any time he felt like it, because he wasn’t a goodperson. And that I ought to remember that, any time I considered growing up to be good.”The old wizard did not show the force of the blow. Only a slight widening of his eyes would have betrayed it, if you had been watching him veryclosely.“Don’t worry, Headmaster,” said the boy. “I haven’t gotten my wirescrossed. I know that I’m supposed to learn goodness from Hermione andFawkes, not from Professor Quirrell and you. Which brings me to theactual reason why I came here. Hermione’s time is too valuable to wastein detentions. Professor Snape will revoke it, claiming that I blackmailedhim.”After a hesitation the old wizard nodded his head, the silver beardswaying slowly beneath. “That would not be best for her, Harry,” the oldwizard said. “But the detention can be put down as being served withProfessor Binns, and you and she can study together in his classroom.”“Fine,” the boy said. “I think that was all the business we had together,in the end. You may expect, the next time you seem to be working on theside of the bad guys or letting them win, that I will do whatever I thinkFawkes would tell me to, regardless of how much trouble comes of it. Ihope we’re both clear on that.”Without another word, the boy turned and walked out of the room,through the open door of black metal, the words “Lumos!” and the light ofhis wand following a moment later.1197 *The old wizard stood there silent, silent amid the ruins of the liveswhich his own life had left behind. His wrinkled hand rose, shaking, totouch at his half-moon glasses—The boy poked his head back in. “Would you mind switching on thestairs, Headmaster? I’d rather not go through all the work again to leavethe same way I came.”“Go, Harry Potter,” the old wizard said. “The stairs will receive you.”(Some time later, an earlier version of Harry, who had invisiblywaited next to the gargoyles since 9pm, followed the Deputy Headmistress through the opening that parted for her, stood quietly behindher on the turning stairs until they came to the top, and then, still underthe Cloak, spun his Time-Turner thrice.)Aftermath: Professor Quirrell and—In a shadowy clearing the Defense Professor waited, his back leanednegligently against the rough grey bark of a towering beech tree as yetunleaved in the late March days, so that its trunk and crown seemed likea pale arm reaching up from the ground and exploding into a hand ofa thousand fingers. Around the Defense Professor and above him werebranches so dense that even in the earliest spring, with few trees so muchas budding, you could have hardly seen the sky from the ground. Thestrands of the wooden net crossed and proliferated so many times that ifyou were on a broomstick above, searching for someone below, you wouldhave found it easier to follow your ears than your eyes. Nor would it havehelped that it was almost dark amid the prohibited woods, the unseensun almost set, so that only a few glows of fading sunlight illuminatedthe tops of the tallest trees.Then came the faintest sound of footsteps, almost inaudible even onthe forest ground; the gait of a man accustomed to passing unseen. Notwig snapped, nor leaf rustled—“Good afternoon,” said Professor Quirrell. The Defense Professor didnot trouble to move his eyes, or his hands from where they rested negligently at his side.A figure clad in a black cloak shimmered into existence, his head turning to look left and then right. In the figure’s right hand, gripped low, wasa wand of wood so grey it was almost silver.“I do not know why you wished to meet here of all places,” said SeverusSnape, his voice cool.“Oh,” Professor Quirrell said idly, as though the whole matter was ofthe least importance, “I thought you would prefer privacy. The walls ofHogwarts have ears, and you would not wish the Headmaster to know ofyour role in yesterday’s affair, would you?”The March chill seemed to grow deeper, the temperature further fall.“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” the Potions Master said icily.“You know perfectly well what we’re talking about,” said ProfessorQuirrell in an amused voice. “Really, my good Professor, you should notmeddle in the affairs of idiots unless you are ready to defend yourselfupon the instant from all their violence.” (The Defense Professor’s handsstill lay relaxed and open at his side.) “And yet none of those idiots seemto remember the sight of you falling, nor do the young ladies recall yourpresence. Which raises the fascinating question of why you would go tothe extraordinary length, I dare say the desperate length, of casting fiftytwo Memory Charms.” Professor Quirrell tilted his head. “Would you fearso much the opinions of mere students? I think not. Would you dreadthe matter becoming known to your good friend, Lord Malfoy? But thosefools, upon the very spot, invented a quite satisfactory excuse for yourpresence. No, there is only one person who holds so much power over you,and who would be most perturbed to find you executing any plot withouthis knowledge. Your true and hidden master, Albus Dumbledore.”“What?” hissed the Potions Master, the anger plain upon his face.“But now, it seems, you are moving on your own; and so I find myselfmost intrigued as to what you could possibly be doing, and why.” The Defense Professor regarded the black-clad silhouette of the Potions Masterwith the scrutiny a man might give an exceptionally interesting bug, evenif it was still ultimately just a bug.“I am no servant of Dumbledore’s,” the Potions Master said coldly.“Really? What astonishing news.” The Defense Professor smiledslightly. “Do tell me all about it.”There was a long pause. From some tree an owl hooted, the soundhuge in the silence; neither man startled or flinched.“You don’t want me as your enemy, Quirrell,” Severus Snape said, hisvoice very soft.“I don’t?” said Professor Quirrell. “How would you know?”“On the other hand,” the Potions Master continued, voice still soft,“my friends enjoy many advantages.”The man leaning against the grey bark raised his eyebrows. “Such as?”“There is much that I know of this school,” said the Potions Master.“Things you might not think I knew.”There was an expectant pause.“How incredibly fascinating,” said Professor Quirrell. The man wasexamining his fingernails with a bored look. “Do go on.”“I know you have been… investigating… the third-floor corridor—”“You know nothing of the sort.” The man’s back straightened againstthe wood. “Do not bluff against me, Severus Snape; I find it annoying,and you are in no position to annoy me. A single glance would tell anycompetent wizard that the Headmaster has laced that corridor witha ridiculous quantity of wards and webs, triggers and tripsigns. Andmore: there are Charms laid there of ancient power, magical constructsof which I have heard not even rumors, techniques that must have beendisgorged from the hoarded lore of Flamel himself. Even He-Who-MustNot-Be-Named would have had trouble passing those without notice.”Professor Quirrell tapped a thoughtful finger on his cheek. “And for theactual lock, a Colloportus laid on an ordinary doorknob, cast so weakly thatit could not have kept out Miss Granger on the day she entered Hogwarts.Never before in my existence have I encountered such a blatant trap.”Now the Defense Professor narrowed his eyes. “I know of no one left inthe world against whom such fantastic feats of detection would serveany useful purpose. If there is some wizard possessed of ancient lore,of whom I know nothing, against whom this trap is set—you may tradethat information for as much silence as you like, my dear Professor, anda good serving of my favor left over afterward.”You could have sworn that Professor Quirrell was watching SeverusSnape with keen interest. Not the faintest trace of a smile crossed theman’s lips.There was another long silence in the clearing.“I do not know who Dumbledore fears,” Snape said. “But I know whatbait he has set out, and somewhat of how it is truly guarded—”“As to that,” said Professor Quirrell, sounding bored again, “I stole itmonths ago, and left a fake in its place. But thank you kindly for asking.”“You’re lying,” said Severus Snape after a pause.“Yes, I am.” Professor Quirrell leaned back against the grey woodagain, his eyes drifting up to the dense net of branches, the falling nightscarcely visible between the complex crossings. “I simply wished to learnwhether you would call me on it, since you are pretending to know so little.” The Defense Professor smiled to himself.The Potions Master looked like he was about to choke on his own fury.“What do you want?”“Nothing, really,” said the Defense Professor, continuing to gaze atthe forest ceiling. “I was only curious. I suppose I shall just watch andsee where your plotting goes, and meanwhile I will say nothing to theHeadmaster—so long as you are willing to do me a favor now and then, ofcourse.” A dry smile crossed the face. “You are dismissed for now, SeverusSnape. Though I wouldn’t mind having another little chat soon, if you’rewilling to speak with me honestly of where your loyalties lie. And I domean honestly, not the false faces you’ve shown today. You might findyou have more allies than you thought. Take some time to think it over,my friend.”1201 *Aftermath: Draco Malfoy and—A rainbow hemisphere, a dome of solid force with little chromaticity of its own which sent back the infringing light in splintered reflections, iridescent in many colors, as it fractured the shine of the manysplendored chandeliers of the Slytherin common room.Sheltered beneath the rainbow hemisphere, the terrified face of ayoung witch who had never fought bullies, who had not joined any ofProfessor Quirrell’s armies, who was getting Acceptable marks at best inher Defense class, who could not have cast a Prismatic Barrier even tosave her own life.“Oh, stop it,” said Draco Malfoy, making his voice sound bored despitethe sweat that had broken out underneath his robes, as he kept his wandpointed at the barrier that was sheltering Millicent Bulstrode.He couldn’t remember making the decision, there’d just been the twoolder boys about to hex Millicent, the common room silently staring, andthen Draco’s hand had just drawn his wand and cast the barrier, leavinghis heart to pump itself full of shocked adrenaline while his poor sad brainfrantically racked itself for explanations—The two older boys were straightening up from where they’d beenlooming over Millicent, turning to Draco, looking at him with a mixtureof shock and anger. Gregory and Vincent beside him had already drawntheir own wands, but weren’t pointing them. All three of them togethercouldn’t have won, anyway.But the older boys wouldn’t hex him. Nobody could possibly be stupidenough to hex the next Lord Malfoy.It wasn’t fear of being hexed that was making Draco sweat beneathhis robes, as he desperately hoped the beads of water weren’t visible onhis forehead.Draco was sweating because of the dawning and sickening certaintythat even if he got away with this now, if he kept down this path, therewould come a time when it would all come crashing down; and then hemight not be the next Lord Malfoy anymore.“Mr. Malfoy,” said the oldest-looking boy. “Why are you protectingher?”“So you’ve located the mistress of the conspiracy,” Draco said with aNumber Two Sneer, “and it’s, let me get this straight now, a first-year girlnamed Millicent Bulstrode. She’s just a conduit, you niddlewit!”“So?” demanded the older boy. “She still helped them!”Draco lifted his wand and the Prismatic Sphere winked out. Still talking in a bored voice, Draco said, “Did you know what you were doing, MissBulstrode?”“N-no,” Millicent stammered from where she was still sitting at herdesk.“Did you know where the Slytherin messages you were passing onwere going to?”“No!” said Millicent.“Thank you,” Draco said. “All of you please leave her alone, she’s justa pawn. Miss Bulstrode, you may consider the favor you did me in February to have been repaid.” And Draco turned back to his Potions homework, hoping to Merlin and back again that Millicent didn’t say anythingincredibly stupid like ‘What favor?’—“Then why,” a voice said clearly from across the room, “did thosewitches go where a note from Millicent told them to go?”Sweating even more, Draco lifted his head again to look at where Randolph Lee had spoken. “What did the fake note say exactly?” said Draco.“Was it, ‘I command you to go forth in the name of the Dark Lady Bulstrode’ or ‘Please meet me here, sincerely Millicent?’”Randolph Lee opened his mouth, hesitated for a fractional second—“I thought so,” said Draco. “That wasn’t a very good test, Mr. Lee, it—it can—” A frantic, nerve-racking moment while he figured out how tosay it without using Harry-words like false positive. “It can get the witchesto go there if any of them is just friends with Millicent.”As though the matter had been entirely settled, Draco looked downagain at his Potions homework, ignoring (except for the feeling of sickdread in his stomach) the whispers from around the room.It was only out of the corner of his eye that he caught Gregory staringat him.Draco’s eyes rested on his Astronomy homework, but he couldn’t makehis mind focus there. If you were trying not to think about things HarryPotter had said, pretty much the worst possible thing you could do waslook at your textbook’s pictures of the night sky, and try to rememberwhat you weren’t supposed to know about how the planets wandered. Astronomy, a noble and prestigious art, a sign of learning and knowledge;only Muggles possessed secret modern artifacts which could do it a million billion times better using methods that Harry had tried to explainand which Draco still couldn’t begin to understand except that apparentlyit didn’t even take magic to make things do Arithmancy.Draco looked at the pictures of constellations, and wondered if it waslike this in the other Houses, if people were always threatening each otherin Ravenclaw.Harry Potter had told him once that soldiers on a battlefield didn’treally fight for their country. Patriotism might get them to the battlefield in the first place, but once they were there, they fought to protecteach other, the friends they’d trained with who were right in front of them.And Harry had observed, and Draco had known that it was true, that youcouldn’t use loyalty to a leader to power a Patronus Charm, it wasn’t quitethe right kind of warm and happy thought. But thinking of protectingsomeone beside you—That, Harry Potter had said thoughtfully, was probably why the DeathEaters had fallen apart the moment the Dark Lord had departed. Theyhadn’t been warm enough to each other.You could recruit a group that included Bellatrix Black and AmycusCarrow alongside Lord Malfoy and Mr. MacNair, and keep them in linewith the Cruciatus Curse. But the instant the master of the Dark Markwas gone, you didn’t have an army anymore, you had a circle of acquaintances. That was why Father had failed. It hadn’t even really been hisfault. There’d been nothing Father could have done, after inheritingDeath Eaters who weren’t really friends with each other.And even though it was Slytherin House he was supposed to defend—Slytherin House which he and Harry had formed a pact to save—sometimes Draco couldn’t help but think that it was just less wearisome when he was leading army practices. When he was working withstudents from the other three Houses that weren’t Slytherin. Once yousaw and named the problems, you couldn’t stop seeing them, it just gotmore annoying every day.“Mr. Malfoy?” said the voice of Gregory Goyle, from where he was lying on the floor beside Draco’s desk, in the small but private bedroom;Gregory was doing his Transfiguration homework, on which he oftenneeded help.Any distraction was welcome at this point. “Yes?” said Draco.“You weren’t really plotting against Granger at all,” said Gregory.“Were you?”The sensation spreading through Draco’s stomach felt just like Gregory’s voice sounded, sickened and afraid.“You actually were helping Granger, that day you picked her up off thefloor,” said Gregory. “And before, that time you kept her from falling offthe roof. You helped a mudblood—”“Yeah, right,” said Draco sarcastically, without the slightest hesitationor delay, looking back down at his Astronomy homework like he wasn’tthe least bit nervous. It was all happening the way Draco had feared itwould, but at least that meant he’d played this conversation in his headover and over, coming up with the right opening gambit. “Come on, Gregory, you’ve dueled General Granger, you know how strong her spells are.Like a real Muggle-spawn is going to be more powerful than you, morepowerful than Theodore, more powerful than every single pureblood inour whole school year except me? Don’t you actually believe in anything Father says? She’s adopted. Her parents died in the war and someone stuckher with a couple of Muggles to hide her. No way is General Granger areal mudblood.”A slow pulse of silence through Draco’s bedroom. Draco wanted toknow, needed to know what look was on Gregory’s face. But he couldn’tlook up from his desk, not yet, not until Gregory spoke first.And then—“Is that what Harry Potter said to you?” said Gregory.The voice wavered, and broke. When Draco looked up from his homework, he saw that tears were leaking out of Gregory’s eyes.Apparently that hadn’t worked.“I don’t know what to do,” Gregory said in a whisper. “I don’t knowwhat to do now, Mr. Malfoy. Your father isn’t—when he finds out—he’snot going to like it, Mr. Malfoy!”It’s not your job to decide what Father will like, Goyle—Draco could hear the words in his head; they sounded in Father’svoice, with the same sternness. It was the sort of thing Father had toldhim to say, if Vincent or Gregory ever questioned him; and if that didn’twork he was to hex them. They were not equal friends, Father had said,and he wasn’t ever to forget it. Draco was in charge, they were his servants, and if Draco couldn’t keep it that way then he wasn’t fit to inheritHouse Malfoy…“It’s all right, Gregory,” Draco said, as gently as he could. “All you’vegot to do is worry about protecting me. Nobody’s going to blame you forfollowing my orders, not my father, not yours.” Putting all the warmth hecould into his voice, like trying to cast a Patronus Charm. “And anyway,the next war isn’t going to be the same as the last one. House Malfoy wasaround long before the Dark Lord, and not every Lord Malfoy does thesame thing. Father knows that.”“Does he?” said Gregory in trembling voice. “Does he really?”Draco nodded. “Professor Quirrell knows it too,” said Draco. “That’swhat the armies are about. The Defense Professor’s right, when the nextwar comes, Father won’t be able to unite the whole country, they’ll remember the last war. But anyone who’s fought in Professor Quirrell’s armieswill remember who the strongest generals were, they’ll know who’s worthy to lead them. They’ll proclaim Harry Potter their Lord, and I’ll be hisright hand, and House Malfoy will come out on top, like always. Peoplemight even turn to me, if Potter isn’t there, so long as they think I’m trustworthy. That’s what I’m setting up now. Father will understand.”Gregory reached up and wiped his eyes, looking down again at hisTransfiguration homework. “Okay,” Gregory said in a shaky voice. “Ifyou say so, Mr. Malfoy.”Draco nodded again, ignoring the hollow feeling inside himself at thelies he’d just told his friend, and turned back to the stars.Aftermath: Hermione Granger and—Being invisible should’ve been more interesting than this, the corridorsof Hogwarts should have been outlined in strange colors or something.But actually, Hermione thought, being under Harry’s invisibility cloakwas exactly like not being under an invisibility cloak, except for the cloakpart. When you pulled the veil of soft black cloth down from the hood andover your face, you couldn’t even see it stretching in front of you, and afterward it didn’t seem to impede your breathing. And the world lookedjust the same, except that when you walked past things of metal, youdidn’t see any small reflections of yourself. Portraits never looked at you,only did whatever strange things they did when they were alone. Hermione hadn’t tried walking past a mirror yet, she wasn’t sure she wanted to.Most of all, there was no you anymore as you walked around, no hands,no feet, just a changing point of view. It was an unnerving feeling, not somuch of being invisible as of not existing.Harry hadn’t questioned her at all, she’d just got out the word ‘invisibility’ and then Harry was drawing his invisibility cloak from his pouch.She hadn’t even been given a chance to explain about her extremely secret meeting with Daphne and Millicent Bulstrode, or that she thought itwould help protect the other girls, Harry had just handed over what wasprobably a Deathly Hallow. If you were fair, and she did try to be fair, shehad to admit that sometimes Harry could be a very true, true friend.The secret meeting itself had been a great big failure.Millicent had claimed to be a seer.Hermione had carefully explained to Millicent and Daphne at considerable length that this could not possibly be true.She and Harry had looked up Divination early on in their research;Harry had insisted that they read everything they could find aboutprophecies that wasn’t in the Restricted Section. As Harry had observed,it would save a lot of effort if they could just get a seer to prophesy everything they would figure out thirty-five years later. (Or to put it in Harry’sterms, any means of obtaining information transmitted from the distantfuture was potentially an instant global victory condition.)But, as Hermione had explained to Millicent, prophesying wasn’t controllable, there was no way to ask for a prophecy about anything in particular. Instead (the books had said) there was a sort of pressure that built upin Time, when some huge event was trying to happen, or stop itself fromhappening. And seers were like weak points that let out the pressure,when the right listener was nearby. So prophecies were only about big,important things, because only that generated enough pressure; and youalmost never got more than one seer saying the same thing, because afterward the pressure was gone. And, as Hermione had further explainedto Millicent, the seers themselves didn’t remember their prophecies, because the message wasn’t for them. And the messages would come out inriddles, and only someone who heard the prophecy in the seer’s originalvoice would hear all the meaning that was in the riddle. There was no possible way that Millicent could just give out a prophecy any time she wanted,about school bullies, and then remember it, and if she had it would’ve comeout as ‘the skeleton is the key’ and not ‘Susan Bones has to be there’.Millicent had been looking rather frightened at this point, so Hermione had relaxed her fists where they’d been jammed on her hips, calmedherself down, and stated carefully that she was glad Millicent had helpedthem, but they had sometimes walked into traps following what Millicentsaid, and so Hermione really did want to know where the messages hadactually come from.And Millicent had said in a small voice:But, but she told me that she was a seer…Hermione had told Daphne not to press it, after Millicent had refusedto give up her source. It wasn’t just that Hermione had felt awful aboutthe scared look on Millicent’s face. It was that Hermione had a strongfeeling that if they did find the person who’d been telling Millicent things,why, they would turn out to just be finding envelopes under their pillowin the morning.She was getting that same despairing feeling she’d gotten in the battlebefore Christmas, looking at Zabini’s charts with all the colored lines andboxes and… and she had only just now realized what it meant that Zabinihad been the one showing her that chart.Even for a Ravenclaw, she felt, there was such a thing as having yourlife get overly complicated.Hermione began ascending a short spiral of yellow marble steps protruding from a central spine, a poorly-kept “secret” staircase that wasactually one of the fastest ways up from the Slytherin dungeons to theRavenclaw tower, but which only witches could traverse. (Why girls inparticular needed a quick way to move from Ravenclaw to Slytherin andback was something Hermione found a bit puzzling.) At the top of thestaircase, now that she was away from Slytherin places and back into themain parts of Hogwarts, Hermione stopped and took off Harry’s invisibility cloak.After her pouch had swallowed the cloak, Hermione turned right andstarted to walk down a short passageway, now automatically keepingan eye out in all directions without really thinking about it, and herconstantly-scanning eyes glanced into a shadowy alcove—(fleeting disorientation)—and then a rush of shock and fear hit her like a Stunning Hex overher whole body, she found that without any thought or any conscious decision her wand had leaped into her hand and was already pointed at……a black cloak so wide and billowing that it was impossible to determine whether the figure beneath was male or female, and atop the cloaka broad-brimmed black hat; and a black mist seemed to gather beneathit and obscure the face of whoever or whatever might lie beneath.“Hello again, Hermione,” whispered a sibilant voice from beneath theblack hat, from behind the black mist.Hermione’s heart was already pounding hugely inside her chest, herwitch’s robes felt already sweat-dampened against her skin, there was ataste of fear already in her mouth; she didn’t know why she was so suddenly filled up with adrenaline but her hand gripped harder on her wand.“Who are you?” Hermione demanded.The hat tilted slightly; the whispery voice, when it came forth fromthe black mist, sounded dry as dust. “The last ally,” spoke the sibilantwhisper. “The one who finally answers, when no other will answer you. Iam perhaps the only true friend you have in all Hogwarts, Hermione. Foryou have now seen how the others stayed silent when you were in need—”“What’s your name?”The black cloak rotated slightly, back and forth, it didn’t look like shoulders shrugging, but it conveyed a shrug. “That is the riddle, young Ravenclaw. Until you solve it, you may call me whatever you wish.”She could feel her palm already sweaty and was thankful for thespiral grooves on her wand that helped her hand keep a steady grip onthe wood. “Well, Mister Incredibly Suspicious Person,” Hermione said,“what do you want with me?”“That is the wrong question,” came the whisper from black mist. “Youshould ask, rather, what I can offer you.”“No,” the young girl said quite steadily, “I don’t think I should be askingthat, actually.”A high-pitched chuckle from behind the black mist. “Not power,”whispered the voice, “not wealth, you care little for such things, do you,young Ravenclaw? Knowledge. That is what I possess. I know what is unfolding within this school, all the hidden plans and players, the answersof the riddle. I know the true reason for the coldness you see in HarryPotter’s eyes. I know the true nature of Professor Quirrell’s mysteriousillness. I know who Dumbledore truly fears.”“Good for you,” said Hermione Granger. “But do you know how manylicks it takes to get to the Tootsie Roll center of a Tootsie Pop?”The black mist seemed to darken slightly, the voice sounded lowerwhen it spoke, disappointed. “So you are not even curious, young Ravenclaw, about the truths behind the lies?”“One hundred and eighty-seven,” she said. “I tried it once and that’show many it came out to.” Her hand was almost slipping on her wand,there was a sense of fatigue in her fingers like she’d been holding thewand for hours instead of minutes—The voice hissed, “Professor Snape is a hidden Death Eater.”Hermione almost dropped her wand.“Ah,” the voice whispered in satisfaction. “I thought that might interest you. So, Hermione. Is there anything else you would like to knowabout your enemies, or those you call friends?”1210 *She stared up at the black mist that topped the towering black cloak,frantically trying to order her thoughts. Professor Snape was a DeathEater? Who would tell her something like that, why, what was going on?“That’s—” Hermione said. Her voice was quavering. “That’s extremely serious business, if it’s really true. Why are you telling something like thatto me, and not to Headmaster Dumbledore?”“Dumbledore did nothing to stop Snape,” the black mist whispered.“You saw it, Hermione. The rot at Hogwarts begins at the top. Everythingthat is wrong with this school, it all begins with the mad Headmaster. Youalone dared to call him out for it—and therefore I speak to you.”“And have you also spoken to Harry Potter, then?” Hermoine said,keeping her voice as even as she could. If this was his helpful ghost—The black mist darkened and lightened, like a shake of the head. “I amfrightened of Harry Potter,” it whispered. “Of the coldness in his eyes, ofthe darkness that grows behind them. Harry Potter is a killer, and anyonewho is an obstacle to him will die. Even you, Hermione Granger, if youdare truly oppose him, the darkness behind his eyes will reach out anddestroy you. This I know.”“Then you don’t know half of what you pretend to know,” Hermionesaid, her voice a little firmer. “I’m scared of Harry too. But not becauseof what he might ever do to me. I’m scared of what he might do to protectme—”“Wrong.” The whisper was flat, and hard, as if to brook no possibilityof denial. “Harry Potter will turn against you in time, Hermione, whenthe darkness takes him fully. He will not shed a tear, he will not evennotice, on the day his footsteps finally crush you underneath.”“Double wrong!” she said back in a rising voice, even though therewere chills going down her spine. One of Harry’s phrases came to her.“Just what do you think you know, and how do you think you know it,anyway?”“Time—” The voice seemed to catch itself. “Time enough for that later.For now, for today, indeed Harry Potter is not your enemy. And yet youare in gravest danger.”“I can believe that,” said Hermione Granger. She desperately wantedto shift her wand to her other hand, she felt like she needed to grab herright arm just to keep it up, her head ached like she’d been staring at theblack mist for days; she didn’t know why she’d gotten tired so quickly.“Lucius Malfoy has taken notice of you, Hermione.” The whisper hadrisen, departed from its tonelessness, taken on a note of audible concern.“You have humiliated Slytherin House, you have defeated his son in battle.Even before then you were an embarrassment to all who stand with theDeath Eaters; for you are a Muggleborn and yet you possess a power ofwizardry greater than any pureblood. And now you are becoming known,the eyes of the world on you. Lucius Malfoy seeks to crush you, Hermione,to hurt you and perhaps even kill you, and he has the means to do it!” Thewhisper had grown urgent.There was a pause.“Is that all?” Hermione said. If she was ex-Colonel Zabini or HarryPotter, she’d probably be asking clever questions to gather more information; but her mind felt slow and fatigued. She really needed to get outof here and go lie down for a while.“You don’t believe me,” the whisper said, softer and sadder now. “Whynot, Hermione? I am trying to help you.”Hermione took a step backward, away from the shadowy alcove.“Why not, Hermione?” demanded the voice, rising to a hiss. “You oweme that much! Tell me, and then—” The voice caught, and came backquieter. “And then you can go, I suppose. Only tell me—why—”Maybe she shouldn’t’ve answered; maybe she should’ve just turnedand fled, or better yet, cast a Prismatic Wall first and then screamed atthe top of her lungs as she ran; but it was the note of real pain in the voicethat caught her, and so she answered.“Because you look incredibly dark and scary and suspicious,” Hermione said, keeping her voice polite, as her wand stayed level on the towering black cloak and the faceless black mist.“That’s all?” whispered the voice incredulously. Sadness seemed to infuse it. “I hoped for better from you, Hermione. Surely such a Ravenclawas you, the most intelligent Ravenclaw to grace Hogwarts in a generation,knows that appearances can be misleading.”“Oh, I know it,” said Hermione. She took another step back, her tiredfingers tightening on the wand. “But the thing that people forget some*1212 *times, is that even though appearances can be misleading, they’re usuallynot.”There was a pause.“You are the clever one,” said the voice, and the black mist evaporatedaway, no longer obscuring; she saw the face beneath, and recognitionsent a jolt of terrified adrenaline bursting through her—(fleeting disorientation)—and then a rush of shock and fear hit her like a Stunning Hex overher whole body, she found that without any thought or any conscious decision her wand had leaped into her hand and was already pointed at……a shining lady, her long white dress billowing about her as thoughin invisible winds; neither her hands nor her feet were visible, her facehidden beneath a white veil; and she was glowing all over, not like a ghost,not transparent, just surrounded by soft white light.Hermione stared open-mouthed at the gentle sight, wondering whyher heart was already hammering, and why she felt so scared.“Hello again, Hermione,” the kindly whisper emanated from thewhite glow behind the veil. “I’ve been sent to help you, so please don’t beafraid. I am your servant in all things; for you, my Lady, are the bearer ofa most marvelous destiny—”………1213 *ianne Felthorne descended the stairs of roughened stone and crudemortar, keeping a Lumos lit through the distances between firesconces, holding aloft her wand through the gaps from light to light.She came to the empty rock cavern pierced by many dark openings,lit by a torch of ancient style that fired as she entered.There was no one else there, as yet, and after long minutes of nervous standing, she began the spell to Transfigure a cushioned sofa largeenough for two people to sit, or maybe even lie down on. A simple woodenstool would have been easier, she could have done that in fifteen seconds,but—well—Even when the sofa was fully conjured, Professor Snape still hadn’tarrived, and she sat down on the left side of her sofa with her pulse hammering in her throat. Somehow she was only becoming more nervous,not less, as the delay stretched.She knew this was the last time.The last time before all these memories went away, and RianneFelthorne found herself in a mysterious cavern, wondering what wasgoing on.There was something about it that felt like dying.The books said a properly done Obliviation wasn’t harmful, peopleforgot things all the time. People dreamed, and then woke up withoutremembering their dreams. Obliviation didn’t even involve that muchdiscontinuity, just a brief instant of disorientation; it was like being distracted by a loud noise and losing track of a thought you couldn’t seem1215 *to remember afterward. That was what the books said, and why MemoryCharms were fully approved by the Ministry for all authorized governmental purposes.But still, these thoughts, the thoughts she was thinking right now; soonnobody would have them anymore. When she looked ahead in the future,there was nobody to complete the thoughts she wasn’t finished thinking.Even if she managed to tie up all the loose ends in her mind over the nextminute, there wouldn’t be anything left of it afterward. Wasn’t that exactly what you would find yourself reflecting on, if you were going to diein the next minute?There came the sound of muffled steps…Severus Snape emerged into the cavern.His eyes moved to her sitting on the sofa, and a strange expressioncrossed his face; strange because it wasn’t sardonic, or angry, or cold.“Thank you, Miss Felthorne,” Snape said quietly, “that was considerate of you.” The Potions Master took out his wand and performed theusual privacy Charms, and then he moved toward her, and sat down heavily beside her on the Transfigured sofa.Her pulse was now pounding for another reason entirely.She slowly turned to look at Professor Snape, and saw that his headwas leaning back against the sofa, and his eyes were closed. Not sleeping,though. His face appeared tense, unrelaxed, bearing pain.She knew—she was suddenly certain—that she was only allowed tosee this sight because she wouldn’t remember it afterward; and that nobody before her had ever been allowed to see it.The frantic conversation going on inside Rianne Felthorne’s mindsounded something like this: I could just lean over and kiss him, you arecompletely out of your tiny mind, his eyes are closed I bet he wouldn’t stop me intime, I bet it would be years before anyone found your body—But Professor Snape opened his eyes then (to her inner disappointment and relief), and said, in a more normal voice, “Your payment, MissFelthorne.” From his robe he took a ruby, cut to Gringotts standard, andheld it out toward her. “Fifty facets. I will not mind if you count them.”She held out a trembling hand, hoping that Snape would press theruby into her fingers, that she would feel a touch of his skin alive against1216 *hers—But instead Snape raised his hand slightly and dropped the ruby intoher hand, then leaned back against the couch. “You will remember finding it lying on the ground of this cavern, where you came exploring,” saidSnape. “And since nobody except you will actually believe that, you willremember thinking that it would be less troublesome if you deposited themoney into a separate box in Gringotts.”For a stretch there was only the faint crackling of the torch.“Why—” Rianne Felthorne said. He knows I won’t remember. “Why didyou do it? I mean—you said to tell you where bullies would be, and whothey would be, but not whether Granger would be there. And I know, theway the Time-Turner works, if you want to make Granger be there, youcan’t be told whether it’s already happened. So I did work out that wewere the ones telling her where to go. We were, weren’t we?”Snape nodded without speaking. He had closed his eyes again.“But,” said Rianne, “I didn’t understand why you were helping her.And now—after what you did to Granger in the Great Hall—I just don’tunderstand at all.” Rianne had never thought of herself as particularlynice. She’d taken little notice of the controversy over the Sunshine General. But something about helping Granger fight bullies had… well, she’dgotten used to thinking of that as the good side, and thinking of herselfas being on the good side. And she’d found she actually liked it. It washard, to just let that go. “Why’d you do that, Professor Snape?”Snape shook his head, his face tightened.“Is—” Rianne said falteringly. “I mean—so long as we’re here—isthere anything you do want to talk about?” There was something shewanted to say, but she couldn’t make the words pass her own lips.“I can think of one matter,” Snape said after a pause. “If you are interested, Miss Felthorne.”Snape’s eyes were still shut, so she couldn’t just nod her head. Hervoice almost broke, when she forced herself to say “Yes.”“There’s a certain boy in your class who likes you, Miss Felthorne,”Snape said from behind his closed eyes. “I won’t say his name. But hewatches you every time you walk across the room, when he thinks you1217 *aren’t looking. He dreams about you and desires to possess you, but he’snever asked you for so much as a kiss.”Her heart started hammering even harder.“Please tell me the honest truth, Miss Felthorne. What do you thinkof that boy?”“Well—” she said. She was stumbling over her words. “I think—tonever even ask for one kiss—would be—”Sad.Just too pitiful.“Weakness,” she said, her voice trembling.“I agree,” said Snape. “Suppose that boy had helped you, though.Would you think that you owed him a kiss, if he asked?”She inhaled sharply—“Or would you think,” Snape continued, his eyes still closed, “that hewas just being bothersome?”The words stabbed into her like a knife and she couldn’t help gaspingout loud.Snape’s eyes flew open, and his gaze met hers across the sofa.Then the Potions Master began to laugh, small sad chuckles.“No, not you, Miss Felthorne!” Snape said. “Not you! We really aretalking about a boy. One who attends your Potions class, in fact.”“Oh,” she said. She tried to remember what Snape had said before,now feeling rather unnerved as she thought of some boy watching her,always silently watching. “Well, um, in that case. That’s kind of creepy,actually. Who is it?”The Potions Master shook his head. “It doesn’t matter,” said Snape.“Out of curiosity, what would you think if that boy were still in love withyou years later?”“Um,” she said, feeling a bit confused, “that would be totally pathetic?”The torch crackled a bit in the cavern.“It’s strange,” Snape said quietly. “I have had two mentors, over thecourse of my days. Both were extraordinarily perceptive, and neither oneever told me the things I wasn’t seeing. It’s clear enough why the firstsaid nothing, but the second…” Snape’s face tightened. “I suppose I wouldhave to be naive, to ask why he stayed silent.”1218 *The quiet stretched, while Rianne tried frantically to think of something to say.“It is an odd thing,” Snape said, his voice still softer, “to look back after only thirty-two years, and wonder when your life was ruined past allrescuing. Was it determined when the Sorting Hat cried ‘Slytherin!’ forme? It seems unfair, since I was offered no choice; the Sorting Hat spokethe moment it touched upon my head. Yet I cannot claim it named meuntruly. I never treasured knowledge for its own sake. I was not loyal tothe one person I called friend. I was never one for righteous fury, then ornow. Courage? There is no bravery in risking a life already ruined. My little fears have always mastered me, and I never turned aside from any ofthe paths I walked down, for those little fears. No, the Sorting Hat couldnever have put me in her House. Perhaps my final loss was determined,even then. Is that fair, I ask, even if the Sorting Hat speaks truly? Is it fairthat some children should possess more courage than others, and thus aman’s life be judged?”Rianne Felthorne was starting to realize that she’d never had the tiniest inkling of who her Potions Master was inside, and unfortunately allthese dark hidden depths weren’t helping her with her problem.“But no,” Snape said. “I know where it went wrong for the last time.I could point to the very day and hour I missed my final chance. MissFelthorne, did the Sorting Hat offer you Ravenclaw?”“Y-yes,” she said without thinking.“Have you ever been any good at riddles?”“Yes,” she said again, because whatever Professor Snape was about tosay, she wouldn’t hear it if she said no.“I am terrible at riddles,” Snape said in a distant voice. “I was oncegiven a riddle to solve, and I did not understand even the simplest partuntil too late. I did not even realize the riddle was meant for me until toolate. I thought I had merely happened to overhear it, when in truth it wasI who was overheard. So I sold my riddle to another, and that is whenthe wreckage of my life passed beyond retrieval.” Snape’s voice was stilldistant, sounding more abstracted than sorrowful. “And even now, I understand nothing of importance. Tell me, Miss Felthorne, suppose a manwere carrying a knife, and he tripped over a baby and stabbed himself.1219 *Would you say that the baby had,” Snape’s voice lowered, as though hewere imitating some still deeper voice, “the power to vanquish him?”“Um… no?” she said hesitantly.“Then what does it mean to have the power to vanquish someone?”Rianne considered the puzzle. (Wishing, not for the first time in herlife, that she had chosen Ravenclaw and to perdition with her parents’ disapproval; but the Sorting Hat had never offered her Gryffindor.) “Well…”Rianne said. She was having trouble putting her thoughts into words. “Itmeans you’ve got the power, but you don’t have to do it. It means you coulddo it if you tried—”“Choice,” the Potions Master said in the same faraway voice, asthough he wasn’t really talking to her at all. “There will be a choice. Thatis what the riddle seems to imply. And that choice is not a foregoneconclusion to the chooser, for the riddle does not say, will vanquish, butrather the power to vanquish. How would a grown man mark a baby as hisequal?”“What?” said Rianne. She didn’t understand that at all.“Marking a baby is simple. Any strong Dark curse would produce alasting scar. But such may be done to any child. What mark would signifythat a baby was your equal?”She answered with the first thought that came to mind. “If you signeda betrothal contract, that would mean you’d be equals with them someday, when they grew up and you got married.”“That…” said Snape. “That’s probably not it, Miss Felthorne, but thankyou for trying.” The long delicate fingers, honed by stirring potions tounimaginably fine tolerances, reached up and rubbed at the temples ofthe man’s forehead. “It is enough to drive me to madness, so much hinging on such fragile words. Power he knows not… it must be more thansome unknown spell. Not something he could acquire simply by practiceand study. Some innate talent? No one can learn to be a Metamorphmagus… and yet that hardly seems like a power he knows not. Nor can I seehow either could destroy all but a remnant of the other; I can see it in onedirection, but not the reverse…” The Potions Master sighed. “And noneof this means anything to you, does it, Miss Felthorne? The words arenothing. The words are shadows. It is her intonation which carries themeaning and that is something I’ve never been able to…”The Potions Master trailed off, while Rianne stared at him.“A prophecy?” Rianne said in a high squeak. “You heard a prophecy?”She’d taken Divination for a couple of months before dropping it in disgust, and she knew that much about how it worked.“I will try one last thing,” said Snape. “Something I have not triedbefore. Miss Felthorne, listen to the sound of my voice, the way I say it,not the words themselves, and tell me what you think it means. Can youdo that? Good,” said Snape, as she nodded obediently, though she wasn’tsure at all what she was supposed to do.And Severus Snape drew a breath, and intoned, “for those two different spellets cannot exist in the same vuld.”It sent shivers down her spine, all the worse for knowing the hollowwords had been spoken in imitation of a true prophecy. Unnerved, sheblurted out the first thing which came to mind, which might have been influenced by her present company. “Those two different ingredients cannot exist in the same cauldron?”“But why not, Miss Felthorne? What is the meaning of a statement likethat? What are we really being told?”“Ah…” she hazarded. “If the two ingredients mix, they’ll catch fire andburn the cauldron?”Snape’s face did not change expression in the slightest.“Perhaps,” Snape finally said, after they’d sat on the sofa in awful silence for what seemed like minutes. “It would explain the word must.Thank you, Miss Felthorne. Once again you have been most helpful.”“I—” she said, “I was glad to—” and the words stuck in her throat. ThePotions Master had thanked her with a tone of finality, and she knew thatthe time of the Rianne Felthorne who remembered these moments wasdrawing to an end. “I wish I didn’t have to forget this, Professor Snape!”“I wish,” Severus Snape said in a whisper so low she could hardly hearit, “that everything had been different…”The Potions Master stood up from the sofa, the weight of his presencevanishing from beside her. He turned and drew his wand from his robes,pointing it at her.1221 *“Wait—” she said. “Before that—”Somehow it was unbelievably hard to take the first step from fantasyto reality, from imagining to doing. Even if it was only one step andwould never go any further. The gap stretched like the distance betweentwo mountains.The Sorting Hat had never offered her Gryffindor……was it fair that thus a woman’s life be judged?If you can’t say it now, when you won’t even remember it afterward—whennothing will continue from this moment, just as if you were to die—then when willyou ever say it, to anyone?
