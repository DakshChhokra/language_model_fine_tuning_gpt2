Harry followed the direction of her finger and saw… nothing in particular, actually…Then Harry realized. After they’d gone up high enough, there hadn’tbeen any clouds to obscure it any more.“That is the Sun, dear Bella.”




It came out remarkably controlled, the Dark Lord sounding perfectlycalm and maybe a little impatient with her, even as the tears started downHarry’s cheeks.In the endless cold, in the pitch blackness, the Sun would surely havebeen…A happy memory…Bellatrix’s head kept turning.“And the fluffy things?” she said.“Clouds.”There was a pause, and then Bellatrix said, “But what are they?”Harry didn’t answer her, there was no way his voice could have beensteady, would have been steady, it was all he could do to keep his breathing perfectly regular while he cried.After a while, Bellatrix breathed, so softly Harry almost didn’t hear,“Pretty…”Her face slowly relaxed, the color leaving its paleness almost asquickly as it had arrived.Her skeletal body slumped down against the broomstick.The borrowed wand dangled lifelessly from the strap attached to herunmoving hand.Harry’s mind remembered then, the Pepper-Up potion came at a cost;Bellatrix would ssleep for a conssiderable time, Professor Quirrell had said.And in the same instant another part of Harry became utterly convinced, looking back at the chalk-white emaciated woman, seemingdeader in the bright sunlight than anything Harry had ever seen alive,that she was dead, that she had just uttered her last word, that ProfessorQuirrell had misjudged the dosage——or deliberately sacrificed Bellatrix to guard their own escape—Is she breathing?Harry couldn’t see if she was breathing.There was no way, on the broomstick, to reach back and take herpulse.Harry looked ahead to make sure they weren’t about to run into anyflying rocks, kept on steering the broomstick toward the Sun, the invisi*

ble boy and the possibly dead woman riding off into the afternoon, whilehis fingers gripped the wood so hard they turned white.He couldn’t reach back and perform artificial respiration.He couldn’t use anything from his healer’s kit.Trust Professor Quirrell to have not endangered her?Strange, it was strange, that even genuinely believing that ProfessorQuirrell hadn’t meant to kill the Auror (for it would have been stupid),thinking of the Defense Professor’s reassurances no longer felt reassuring.Then it occurred to Harry that he had yet to check—Harry looked back, and hissed, “Teacher?”The snake did not stir within its harness, and said no word.…maybe the snake, not being an actual rider, hadn’t been protectedfrom the acceleration. Or maybe coming that close to the Dementorswithout a shield, even for a moment in Animagus form, had knocked outthe Defense Professor.That wasn’t good.It was to have been Professor Quirrell who told Harry when it was safeto use the portkey.Harry steered the broomstick with whitened fingers, and thought, hethought very hard for a small unmeasured length of time, during whichBellatrix might or might not have been breathing, during which Professor Quirrell himself might have already been not-breathing for a while.And Harry decided that while it was possible to recover from the errorof wasting the portkey in his possession, it was not possible to recoverfrom the error of letting a brain go too long without oxygen.So Harry took the next portkey in the sequence from his pouch, as heslowed his broomstick to a halt in the bright blue air (Harry didn’t know,when he thought about it, whether a portkey’s ability to adjust for theEarth’s rotation also included the ability to match velocity in general withits new surroundings), touched the portkey to the broomstick, and…Harry paused, still holding the twig, the mate of the twig he hadsnapped what seemed like two weeks ago. He was feeling a suddenreluctance; his brain seemed to have learned the rule, by some purely






neural process of operant conditioning, that Snapping Twigs Is A BadIdea.But that wasn’t actually logical, so Harry snapped the twig anyway.
There was a thunderous boom from behind the nearby metal door, causing Amelia to drop the mirror she was holding and spin around with herwand in hand, and then that door burst open to reveal Albus Dumbledore,standing there in front of a great smoking hole in the prison wall.“Amelia,” said the old wizard. There was no trace of any of his customary levity, his eyes were hard as sapphires beneath his half-moon glasses.“I must leave Azkaban and I must do so now. Is there any faster way thana broomstick to get beyond the wards?”“No—”“Then I require your fastest broomstick, at once!”The place where Amelia wanted to be was with the Auror who had beeninjured by that Fiendfyre or whatever it had been.What she needed to do was find out what Dumbledore knew.“You!” the old witch barked at the team around her. “Keep clearingthe corridors until you’re at bottom, they may not all have escaped yet!”And then, to the old wizard, “Two broomsticks. You can brief me oncewe’re in the air.”There was a match of stares, but not a long one.
A sickeningly hard yank caught at Harry’s abdomen, considerably harderthan the yank that had transported him to Azkaban, and this time thedistance traversed was great enough that he could hear an instant of silence, watch the unseeable space between spaces, in the crack betweenone place and another.







The Sun, which had shone on the two only briefly, was swiftly occluded bya raincloud as they shot away from Azkaban, in the direction of the windand faster than the wind.“Who’s behind it?” shouted Amelia to the broomstick flying a paceaway from her.“One of two people,” Dumbledore said back, “I know not, at this instant, who. If the first, then we are in trouble. If the second, we are all infar greater trouble.”Amelia didn’t spare any breath for sighs. “When will you know?”The old wizard’s voice was grim, quiet and yet somehow rising abovethe wind. “Three things they need for perfection, if it is that one: Theflesh of the Dark Lord’s most faithful servant, the blood of the DarkLord’s greatest foe, and access to a certain grave. I had thought HarryPotter safe, with their attempt on Azkaban all but failed—though I stillset guards upon him—but now I am fearful indeed. They have access toTime, someone with a Time-Turner is sending messages for them; and Isuspect the kidnap attempt on Harry Potter has already taken place somehours ago. Which is why we have not heard about it, being in Azkabanwhere Time cannot knot itself. That past came after our own future, yousee.”“And if it is the other?” shouted Amelia. What she had heard alreadywas worrying enough; that sounded like the darkest of Dark rituals, andcentering on the dead Dark Lord himself.The old wizard, his face now even grimmer, said nothing, only shookhis head.
When the portkey’s yank had subsided, the Sun was only just peeking overthe horizon, looking more like dawn than sunset, as their broom hoveredlow above a brief expanse of dark-orange rock and sand, arranged intolumpy hills like someone had kneaded the land’s dough a few times andthen forgotten to roll it flat. In the near distance, waves rolled past inan endless vista of water, though the ground over which the broomstickhovered was above sea level by meters at the least.






Harry blinked at the dawn colors, and then realized the portkey hadbeen international.“Oy!” came a brisk, female shout from behind him, and Harry spunthe broomstick to look. A middle-aged lady was holding up one handto her mouth in a deliberate calling gesture, and bustling forward. Herkindly features, narrow eyes, and umber skin marked a race unfamiliarto Harry; she was clad in brilliant purple robes of a style Harry had neverseen before; and when her lips opened again she spoke with an accentthat Harry couldn’t place, for he was not widely traveled. “Where wereyou? You’re two hours late! I almost gave up on the lot of you… hello?”There was a brief pause. Harry’s thoughts seemed to be moving oddly,too slow, everything felt distant, like there was a thick pane of glass between himself and the world, and another thick pane of glass betweenhimself and his feelings, so that he could see, but not touch. It had comeover him upon seeing the dawn’s light and the kindly witch, and thinkingthat it all seemed like a proper end to the adventure.Then the witch was rushing forward and drawing her wand; a muttered word severed the cuffs that bound the emaciated woman to thebroomstick, and Bellatrix was being floated down onto the sandy rockwith her skeletal arms and pale legs dangling like lifeless things. “Oh,Merlin,” whispered the witch, “Merlin, Merlin, Merlin…”She appears concerned, thought an abstract, distant thing between twopanes of glass. Is that what a real healer would say, or is it what someone toldto put on a performance would say?As though it wasn’t Harry who spoke, but some other part of himself behind yet another pane of glass, a whisper came from his lips. “Thegreen snake on her back is an Animagus.” Not high the whisper, not cold,only quiet. “He is unconscious.”The witch’s head twitched up, to look at where that voice had seemedto speak out of empty air, and then looked back down at Bellatrix. “You’renot Mister Jaffe.”“That would be the Animagus,” whispered Harry’s lips. Oh, thoughtthe Harry behind glass, listening to the sound of his own lips, that makessense; Professor Quirrell must have used a different name.






“Since when is he a—bah, forget it.” The witch laid her wand on thesnake’s nose for a moment, then shook her head sharply. “Nothing wrongwith him that a day’s rest won’t cure. Her…”“Can you wake him up now?” whispered Harry’s lips. Is that a goodidea? thought Harry, but his lips definitely seemed to think so.Again the sharp headshake. “If an Innervate didn’t work on him—”began the witch.“I did not attempt one,” whispered Harry’s lips.“What? Why—oh, never mind. Innervate.”There was a pause, and then a snake slowly crawled out of its harness.Slowly the green head came up, looked around.A blur later, Professor Quirrell was standing, and a moment later hadsagged to his knees.“Lie down,” said the witch without looking up from Bellatrix. “Thatyou in there, Jeremy?”“Yes,” said the Defense Professor rather hoarsely, as he carefully laidhimself down on a relatively flat patch of sandy orange rock. He was notso pale as Bellatrix, but his face was bloodless in the dim dawn light. “Salutations, Miss Camblebunker.”“I told you,” said the witch, sharpness in her voice and a slight smileon her face, “call me Crystal, this isn’t Britain and we’ll have none of yourformality here. And it’s Doctor now, not Miss.”“My apologies, Doctor Camblebunker.” This was followed by a drychuckle.The witch’s smile grew a little wider, her voice that much sharper.“Who’s your friend?”“You don’t need to know.” The Defense Professor’s eyes were closed,where he lay on the ground.“How wrong did it go?”Very dryly indeed: “You can read about it tomorrow in any newspaperwith an international section.”The witch’s wand was tapping here, there, poking and prodding allover Bellatrix’s body. “I missed you, Jeremy.”“Truly?” said the Defense Professor, sounding slightly surprised.“Not even a tiny little bit. If I didn’t owe you—”






The Defense Professor started to laugh, and then it turned into moreof a coughing fit.What do you think? said Slytherin to the Inner Critic, while Harry listened from behind the glass walls. Performance, or reality?Can’t tell, said Harry’s Inner Critic. I’m not in top critical form right now.Can anyone think of a good probe to gather more information? said Ravenclaw.Again that whisper from the empty air above the broomstick: “Whatis the chance of undoing all that was done to her?”“Oh, let’s see. Legilimency and unknown Dark rituals, ten years forthat to set in place, followed by ten years of Dementor exposure? Undothat? You’re out of your skull, Mister Whoever-You-Are. The questionis whether there’s anything left, and I’d call that maybe one chance inthree—” The witch suddenly cut herself off. Her voice, when it spokeagain, was quieter. “If you were her friend, before… then no, you’re nevergetting her back. Best understand that now.”I’m voting that this is a performance, said the Inner Critic. She wouldn’tjust blurt all that out in response to one question unless she was looking for anopportunity.Noted, but I’m putting a low weight of confidence on that, said Ravenclaw.It’s very hard not to let your suspicions control your perceptions when you’re tryingto weigh evidence that subtle.“What potion did you give her?” the witch said after opening Bellatrix’s mouth and peering inside, her wand flashing multiple colors of illumination.The man lying on the ground calmly said, “Pepper-Up—”“Were you out of your mind?”Again the coughing laugh.“She’ll sleep for a week if she’s lucky,” the witch said, and clucked hertongue. “I’ll owl you when she opens her eyes, I suppose, so you can comeback and talk her into that Unbreakable Vow. Have you got anything tostop her from killing me on the spot, if she manages to even move foranother month?”The Defense Professor, eyes still closed, took a sheet of paper from hisrobes; a moment later, words began to appear on it, accompanied by tiny






wisps of smoke. When the smoke had stopped rising, the paper floatedover toward the woman.The woman looked over the paper with raised eyebrows, gave a sardonic snort. “This had better work, Jeremy, or my last will and testamentsays that my whole estate goes into putting a bounty on your head. Speaking of which—”The Defense Professor reached again into his robes and tossed thewitch a bag that made a clinking sound. The witch caught it, weighed it,made a pleased sound.Then she stood up, and the pale skeletal woman floated off the groundbeside her. “I’m heading back,” said the witch. “I can’t start my workhere.”“Wait,” said the Defense Professor, and with a gesture retrieved hiswand from Bellatrix’s hand and harness. Then his hand pointed the wandat Bellatrix, and moved in a small circular gesture, accompanied by aquiet, “Obliviate.”“That’s it,” snapped the witch, “I’m taking her out of here before anyone does her any more damage—” One arm came around to hug the bonyform of Bellatrix Black to her side, and they both disappeared with theloud POP! of Apparition.And there was silence in that lumpy place, but for the gentle rush ofthe passing waves, and a little breath of wind.I think the performance is finished, said the Inner Critic. I give it two anda half out of five stars. She’s probably not a very experienced actor.I wonder if a real healer would seem more fake than an actor told to play one?mused Ravenclaw.Like watching a television show, that was how it felt, like watching atelevision show whose characters you didn’t particularly empathize with,that was all that could be seen and felt from behind the glass walls.Somehow, Harry managed to move his lips himself, send his ownvoice out into the still dawn air, and then was surprised to hear his ownquestion. “How many different people are you, anyway?”The pale man lying on the ground didn’t laugh, but from the broomstick Harry’s eyes saw the sides of Professor Quirrell’s lips curling up, the






edge of that familiar sardonic smile. “I cannot say that I bothered keepingcount. How many are you?”It shouldn’t have shaken the inner Harry so much, hearing that response, and yet he felt—he felt—unstable, like his own center had beensubtracted—Oh.“Excuse me,” said Harry’s voice. It now sounded as distant and detached as the fading Harry felt. “I’m going to faint in a few seconds, Ithink.”“Use the fourth portkey I gave you, the one I said was our fallbackrefuge,” said the man lying on the ground, calmly but swiftly. “It will besafer there. And continue wearing your cloak.”Harry’s free hand retrieved another twig from his pouch and snappedit.There was another portkey yank, internationally long, and then hewas somewhere black.“Lumos,” said Harry’s lips, some part of him looking out for the safetyof the whole.He was inside what looked like a Muggle warehouse, a deserted one.Harry’s legs climbed off the broomstick, lay on the floor. His eyesclosed, and some tidy fraction of self willed his light to fail, before thedarkness took him.

“Where will you go?” yelled Amelia. They were almost at the edge of thewards.“Backward in time to protect Harry Potter,” said the old wizard, andbefore Amelia could even open her lips to ask if he wanted help, she feltthe boundary of the wards as they crossed them.There was a pop of Apparition, and the wizard and the phoenix vanished, leaving behind the borrowed broomstick.

ake.”Harry’s eyes flew open as he came awake with a choking gasp,a jerking start of his prone body. He couldn’t remember any dreams,maybe his brain had been too exhausted to dream, it seemed like he’donly closed his eyes and then heard that word spoken a moment after.“You must awaken,” said the voice of Quirinus Quirrell. “I gave you asmuch time as I could, but it would be wise to reserve at least one use ofyour Time-Turner. Soon we must go backward four hours to Mary’s Place,appearing in every way as though we have done nothing interesting thisday. I wished to speak to you before then.”Harry slowly sat up in the midst of darkness. His body ached, and notonly in the places where it had laid on the hard concrete. Images tumbled over each other in his memory, everything his unconscious brain hadbeen too tired to discharge into a proper nightmare.Twelve terrible voids floating down a metal corridor, tarnishing themetal around them, light dimmed and temperature falling as the emptiness tried to suck all life out of the world—Chalk-white skin, stretched just above the bone that had remainedafter fat and muscle faded—A metal door—A woman’s voice—No, I didn’t mean it, please don’t die—I can’t remember my children’s names any more—


919 *




Don’t go, don’t take it away, don’t don’t don’t—“What was that place?” Harry said hoarsely, in a voice pushed out ofhis throat like water forced through a too-thin pipe, in the darkness itsounded almost as shattered as Bellatrix Black’s voice had been. “Whatwas that place? That wasn’t a prison, that was HELL!”“Hell?” said the calm voice of the Defense Professor. “You mean theChristian punishment fantasy? I suppose there is a similarity.”“How—” Harry’s voice was blocking, there was something hugelodged in his throat. “How—how could they—” People had built thatplace, someone had made Azkaban, they’d made it on purpose, they’d doneit deliberately, that woman, she’d had children, children she wouldn’tremember, some judge had decided for that to happen to her, someonehad needed to drag her into that cell and lock its door while she screamed,someone fed her every day and walked away without letting her out—“Why shouldn’t they?” said the Defense Professor. A pale blue light litthe warehouse, then, showing a high, cavernous concrete ceiling, and adusty concrete floor; and Professor Quirrell sitting some distance awayfrom Harry, leaning his back against a painted wall; the pale blue lightturned the walls to glacier surfaces, the dust on the floor to speckled snow,and the man himself had become an ice sculpture, shrouded in darknesswhere his black robes lay over him. “What use are the prisoners of Azkaban to them?”Harry’s mouth opened in a croak. No words exited.A faint smile twitched on the Defense Professor’s lips. “You know,Mr. Potter, if He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named had come to rule over magical Britain, and built such a place as Azkaban, he would have built it because he enjoyed seeing his enemies suffer. And if instead he began tofind their suffering distasteful, why, he would order Azkaban torn downthe next day. As for those who did make Azkaban, and those who do nottear it down, while preaching lofty sermons and imagining themselvesnot to be villains… well, Mr. Potter, I think if I had my choice of taking teawith them, or taking tea with You-Know-Who, I should find my sensibilities less offended by the Dark Lord.”
920 *




“I don’t understand,” Harry said, his voice was shaking, he’d readabout the classic experiment on the psychology of prisons, the ordinarycollege students who had turned sadistic as soon as they were assignedthe role of prison guards; only now he realized that the experimenthadn’t examined the right question, the one most important question,they hadn’t looked at the key people, not the prison guards but everyoneelse, “I really don’t understand, Professor Quirrell, how can people juststand by and let this happen, why is the country of magical Britain doingthis—” Harry’s voice stopped.The Defense Professor’s eyes appeared to be the same color as always,in the pale blue light, for that light was the same color as Quirinus Quirrell’s irises, those never-thawing chips of ice. “Welcome, Mr. Potter, toyour first encounter with the realities of politics. What do the wretchedcreatures in Azkaban have to offer any faction? Who would benefit fromaiding them? A politician who openly sided with them would associatethemselves with criminals, with weakness, with distasteful things thatpeople would rather not think about. Alternatively, the politician coulddemonstrate their might and cruelty by calling for longer sentences; tomake a display of strength requires a victim to crush beneath you, afterall. And the populace applauds, for it is their instinct to back the winner.”A coldly amused laugh. “You see, Mr. Potter, no one ever quite believesthat they will go to Azkaban, so they see no harm in it for themselves. Asfor what they inflict on others… I suppose you were once told that people care about that sort of thing? It is a lie, Mr. Potter, people don’t carein the slightest, and if you had not led a vastly sheltered childhood youwould have noticed that long ago. Console yourself with this: those nowprisoner in Azkaban voted for the same Ministers of Magic who pledgedto move their cells closer to the Dementors. I admit, Mr. Potter, that Isee little hope for democracy as an effective form of government, but Iadmire the poetry of how it makes its victims complicit in their own destruction.”Harry’s recently cohered self was threatening to shatter into fragments again, the words falling like hammerstrikes on his consciousness,driving him back, step by step, over the precipice where lurked some vastabyss; and he was trying to find something to save himself, some clever






retort that would refute the words, but it did not come.The Defense Professor watched Harry, the gaze reflecting more curiosity than command. “It is very simple, Mr. Potter, to understand howAzkaban was built, and how it continues to be. Men care for what they,themselves, expect to suffer or gain; and so long as they do not expect it toredound upon themselves, their cruelty and carelessness is without limit.All the other wizards of this country are no different within than he whosought to rule over them, You-Know-Who; they only lack his power andhis… frankness.”The boy’s hands were clenched into fists so tightly that the nails cutinto his palm, if his fingers were white or his face was pale you couldn’thave seen that, for the dim blue light cast all into ice or shadow. “You onceoffered to support me if my ambition were to be the next Dark Lord. Isthat why, Professor?”The Defense Professor inclined his head, a thin smile on his lips.“Learn all that I have to teach you, Mr. Potter, and you will rule thiscountry in time. Then you may tear down the prison that democracymade, if you find that Azkaban still offends your sensibilities. Like it ornot, Mr. Potter, you have seen this day that your own will conflicts withthe will of this country’s populace, and that you do not bow your headand submit to their decision when that occurs. So to them, whether ornot they know it, and whether or not you acknowledge it, you are theirnext Dark Lord.”In the monochromatic light, unwavering, the boy and the DefenseProfessor both seemed like motionless ice sculptures, the irises of theireyes reduced to similar colors, looking very much the same in that light.Harry stared directly into those pale eyes. All the long-suppressedquestions, the ones he’d told himself he was putting on hold until theIdes of May. That had been a lie, Harry now knew, a self-deception, hehad kept silent for fear of what he might hear. And now everything wascoming forth from his lips, all at once. “On our first day of class, you triedto convince my classmates I was a killer.”“You are.” Amusedly. “But if your question is why I told them that,Mr. Potter, the answer is that you will find ambiguity a great ally on yourroad to power. Give a sign of Slytherin on one day, and contradict it with
922 *




a sign of Gryffindor the next; and the Slytherins will be enabled to believewhat they wish, while the Gryffindors argue themselves into supportingyou as well. So long as there is uncertainty, people can believe whateverseems to be to their own advantage. And so long as you appear strong,so long as you appear to be winning, their instincts will tell them thattheir advantage lies with you. Walk always in the shadow, and light anddarkness both will follow.”“And,” said the boy, his voice level, “just what do you want out of allthis?”Professor Quirrell had leaned further back against the wall fromwhere he sat, casting his face into shadow, his eyes changing from paleice into dark pits like those of his snake form. “I wish for Britain to growstrong under a strong leader; that is my desire. As for my reasons why,”Professor Quirrell smiled without mirth, “I think they shall stay my own.”“The sense of doom that I feel around you.” The words were becoming harder and harder to say, as the subject danced closer and closer tosomething terrible and forbidden. “You always knew what it meant.”“I had several guesses,” said Professor Quirrell, his expression unreadable. “And I will not yet say all I guessed. But this much I will tell you: itis your doom which flares when we come near, not mine.”For once Harry’s brain managed to mark this as a questionable assertion and possible lie, instead of believing everything it heard. “Why doyou sometimes turn into a zombie?”“Personal reasons,” said Professor Quirrell with no humor at all in hisvoice.“What was your ulterior motive for rescuing Bellatrix?”There was a brief silence, during which Harry tried hard to control hisbreathing, keep it steady.Finally the Defense Professor shrugged, as though it were of no account. “I all but spelled it out for you, Mr. Potter. I told you everythingyou needed to deduce the answer, if you had been mature enough to consider that first obvious question. Bellatrix Black was the Dark Lord’s mostpowerful servant, her loyalty the most assured; she was the single personmost likely to be entrusted with some part of the lost lore of Slytherin thatshould have been yours.”
923 *




Slowly the anger crept over Harry, slowly the wrath, something terrible beginning to boil his blood, in just a few moments he would say something that he really shouldn’t say while the two of them were alone in adeserted warehouse—“But she was innocent,” said the Defense Professor. He was not smiling. “And the degree to which all her choices were taken away from her,so that she never had a chance to suffer for her own mistakes… it struckme as excessive, Mr. Potter. If she tells you nothing of use—” The DefenseProfessor gave another small shrug. “I shall not consider this day’s worka waste.”“How altruistic of you,” Harry said coldly. “So if all wizards are likeYou-Know-Who inside, are you an exception to that, then?”The Defense Professor’s eyes were still in shadow, dark pits that couldnot be met. “Call it a whim, Mr. Potter. It has sometimes amused me toplay the part of a hero. Who knows but that You-Know-Who would saythe same.”Harry opened his mouth a final time—And found that he couldn’t say it, he couldn’t ask the last question,the last and most important question, he couldn’t make the words comeout. Even though a refusal like that was forbidden to a rationalist, forall that he’d ever recited the Litany of Tarski or the Litany of Gendlin orsworn that whatever could be destroyed by the truth should be, in thatone moment, he could not bring himself to say his last question out loud.Even though he knew he was thinking wrongly, even though he knew hewas supposed to be better than this, he still couldn’t say it.“Now it is my turn to inquire of you.” Professor Quirrell’s backstraightened from where it had leaned back against the glacier wall ofpainted concrete. “I was wondering, Mr. Potter, if you had anythingto say about nearly killing me and ruining our mutual endeavor. I amgiven to understand that an apology, in such cases, is considered a signof respect. But you have not offered me one. Is it just that you have notyet gotten around to it, Mr. Potter?”The tone was calm, the quiet edge so fine and sharp that it would sliceall the way through you before you realized you were being murdered.
924 *




And Harry just looked at the Defense Professor with cool eyes thatwould never flinch from anything; not even death, now. He was no longerin Azkaban, no longer fearful of the part of himself that was fearless; andthe solid gemstone that was Harry had rotated to meet the stress, turningsmoothly from one facet to another, from light to darkness, warm to cold.A calculated ploy on his part, to make me feel guilty, put me in a position whereI must submit?Genuine emotion on his part?“I see,” said Professor Quirrell. “I suppose that answers—”“No,” said the boy in a cool, collected voice, “you do not get to framethe conversation that easily, Professor. I went to considerable lengthsto protect you and get you out of Azkaban safely, after I thought you hadtried to kill a police officer. That included facing down twelve Dementors without a Patronus Charm. I wonder, if I had apologized when youdemanded it, would you have said thank-you in turn? Or am I correct inthinking that it was my submission you demanded there, and not onlymy respect?”There was a pause, and then Professor Quirrell’s voice came in reply,openly icy with danger no longer veiled. “It seems you still cannot bringyourself to lose, Mr. Potter.”Darkness stared out of Harry’s eyes without flinching, the DefenseProfessor himself reduced to a mortal thing within them. “Oh, and areyou pondering now, whether you should pretend to lose to me, and pretend to humble yourself before my own anger, in order to preserve yourown plans? Did the thought of a calculated false apology even cross yourmind? Me neither, Professor Quirrell.”The Defense Professor laughed, low and humorless, emptier than thevoid between the stars, dangerous as any vacuum filled with hard radiation. “No, Mr. Potter, you have not learned your lesson, not at all.”“I thought of losing many times, in Azkaban,” said the boy, his voicelevel. “That I ought to simply give up, and turn myself over to the Aurors.Losing would have been the sensible thing to do. I heard your voice sayingit to me, in my mind; and I would have done it, if I had been there by myself.But I could not bring myself to lose you.”
925 *




There was silence, then, for a time; as though even the Defense Professor could not quite think of what to say to that.“I am curious,” said Professor Quirrell at last. “What do you think thatI should apologize for, precisely? I gave you explicit instructions in theevent of a fight. You were to stay down, stay out of the way, cast no magic.You violated those instructions and brought down the mission.”“I made no decision,” the boy said evenly, “there was no choice in it,only a wish that the Auror should not die, and my Patronus was there.For that wish to have never occurred, you should have warned me thatyou might bluff using a Killing Curse. By default, I assume that if youpoint your wand at someone and say Avada Kedavra, it is because youwant them dead. Shouldn’t that be the first rule of Unforgivable CurseSafety?”“Rules are for duels,” said the Defense Professor. Some of the coldness had returned to his voice. “And dueling is a sport, not a branch ofBattle Magic. In a real fight, a curse which cannot be blocked and must bedodged is an indispensable tactic. I would have thought this obvious toyou, but it seems I misjudged your intellect.”“It also seems to me imprudent,” said the boy, continuing as thoughthe other had not spoken, “to not tell me that my casting any spell on youmight kill us both. What if you had suffered some mishap, and I had triedan Innervate, or a Hover Charm? That ignorance, which you permittedfor purposes I cannot guess, played also some part in this catastrophe.”There was another silence. The Defense Professor’s eyes had narrowed, and there was a faintly puzzled look on his face, as though he hadencountered some completely unfamiliar situation; and still the manspoke no word.“Well,” said the boy. His eyes had not wavered from the Defense Professor’s. “I certainly regret hurting you, Professor. But I do not think thesituation calls for me to submit to you. I never really did understand theconcept of apology, still less as it applies to a situation like this; if you havemy regrets, but not my submission, does that count as saying sorry?”Again that cold, cold laugh, darker than the void between the stars.“I wouldn’t know,” said the Defense Professor, “I, too, never understood the concept of apology. That ploy would be futile between us, it
926 *




seems, with both of us knowing it for a lie. Let us speak no more of it,then. Debts will be settled between us in time.”There was silence for a time.“By the way,” said the boy. “Hermione Granger would never have builtAzkaban, no matter who was going to be put in it. And she’d die beforeshe hurt an innocent. Just mentioning that, since you said before that allwizards are like You-Know-Who inside, and that’s just false as a point ofsimple fact. Would’ve realized it earlier if I hadn’t been,” the boy gave abrief grim smile, “stressed out.”The Defense Professor’s eyes were half-lidded, his expression distant.“People’s insides are not always like their outsides, Mr. Potter. Perhapsshe simply wishes others to think of her as a good girl. She cannot usethe Patronus Charm—”“Hah,” said the boy; his smile seemed realer now, warmer. “She’s having trouble for exactly the same reason I did. There’s enough light in herto destroy Dementors, I’m sure. She wouldn’t be able to stop herself fromdestroying Dementors, even at the cost of her own life…” The boy trailedoff, and then his voice resumed. “I might not be such a good person,maybe; but they do exist, and she’s one of them.”Dryly. “She is young, and to make a show of kindness costs her little.”There was a pause at this. Then the boy said, “Professor, I have to ask,when you see something all dark and gloomy, doesn’t it ever occur to youto try and improve it somehow? Like, yes, something goes terribly wrongin people’s heads that makes them think it’s great to torture criminals,but that doesn’t mean they’re truly evil inside; and maybe if you taughtthem the right things, showed them what they were doing wrong, youcould change—”Professor Quirrell laughed, then, and not with the emptiness of before. “Ah, Mr. Potter, sometimes I do forget how very young you are.Sooner you could change the color of the sky.” Another chuckle, this onecolder. “And the reason it is easy for you to forgive such fools and thinkwell of them, Mr. Potter, is that you yourself have not been sorely hurt.You will think less fondly of commonplace idiots after the first time theirfolly costs you something dear. Such as a hundred Galleons from yourown pocket, perhaps, rather than the agonizing deaths of a hundred

strangers.” The Defense Professor was smiling thinly. He took a pocketwatch out of his robes, looked at it. “Let us depart now, if there is nothingmore to say between us.”“You don’t have any questions about the impossible things I did to getus out of Azkaban?”“No,” said the Defense Professor. “I believe I have solved most of themalready. As for the rest, it is too rare that I find a person whom I cannotsee through immediately, be they friend or foe. I shall unravel the puzzlesabout you for myself, in due time.”The Defense Professor shoved himself up, pushing back on the wallwith both hands and rising to his feet, smoothly if too slowly. The boy,less gracefully, did the same.And the boy blurted out the last most terrible question which he hadearlier been unable to ask; as though to say it aloud would make it real,and as though it were not, already, vastly obvious.“Why am I not like the other children my own age?”
In a deserted side-road of Diagon Alley, where scraps of un-Vanishedtrash could be seen lodged into the edges of the brick street and the blankbrick building-sides that surrounded it, along with scattered dirt andother signs of neglect, an ancient wizard and his phoenix Apparated intoexistence.The wizard was already reaching within his robes for his hourglasswhen, in habit, his eyes jumped to a random spot between the road andthe wall, to memorize it—And the old wizard blinked in surprise; there was a scrap of parchment in that spot.A frown crossed Albus Dumbledore’s face as he took a step forwardand took the crumpled scrap, unfolding it.On it was the single word “NO”, and nothing more.Slowly the wizard let it flutter from his fingers. Absently he reacheddown to the pavement, and picked up the nearest scrap of parchment,

which looked remarkably similar to the one he had just taken; he touchedit with his wand, and a moment later it was inscribed with the same word“NO”, in the same handwriting, which was his own.The old wizard had planned to go back three hours to when Harry Potter first arrived in Diagon Alley. He had already watched, upon his instruments, the boy leaving Hogwarts, and that could not be undone (his oneattempt to fool his own instruments, and so control Time without altering its appearance to himself, had ended in sufficient disaster to convincehim to never again try such trickery). He had hoped to retrieve the boy atthe first possible moment after his arrival, and take him to another safelocation, if not Hogwarts (for his instruments had not shown the boy’sreturn). But now—“A paradox if I retrieve him immediately after he arrives in DiagonAlley?” murmured the old wizard to himself. “Perhaps they did not setin motion their plan to rob Azkaban, until after they had confirmed hisarrival here… or else… perhaps…”
Painted concrete, hard floor and distant ceilings, two figures facing offacross from each other. One entity who wore the shape of a man in hislate thirties and already balding, and another mind that wore the formof an eleven-year-old boy with a scar upon his forehead. Ice and shadow,pale blue light.“I don’t know,” said the man.The boy just looked at him. And then said, “Oh, really?”“Truly,” said the man. “I know nothing, and of my guesses I will notspeak. Yet I will say this much—”

hrough green flame they whirled, through the Floo network theyspun, Minerva’s heart racing with a pounding horror that shehadn’t felt in ten years and three months, the corridors between spacecoughed and spit them out into the lobby of Gringotts (the safest Flooreceiver in Diagon Alley, the connection most difficult to intercept, thefastest way out of Hogwarts without a phoenix). A goblin attendantturned toward them, his eyes widened, he began a slightly respectfulbow—Determination, Destination, Deliberation!And the two of them were in the alley just in back of Mary’s Place,wands already out and raised, spinning around back-to-back and thewords of an Anti-Disillusionment Charm already rising to Severus’s lips.The alley was empty.When she turned back to look at Severus, his wand was already cracking down on his own head with a sound like smashing an egg, as his lipschanted words of invisibility; he took on the colors of his surroundings,became a blur of his surroundings, the blur moved and matched whatwas behind him and then there was nothing there.She lowered her wand and stepped forward to receive her ownDisillusionment—From behind her, the unmistakable sound of a burst of flame.








She spun and saw Albus there, his long wand already drawn andraised in his right hand. His eyes were grim beneath the half-circles ofhis glasses, and Fawkes upon his shoulder had spread his fire-coloredwings in readiness for flight and fight.“Albus!” she said. “I thought—” She’d just seen him depart for Azkaban, and she’d thought not even phoenixes could return from there soeasily.Then she realized.“She escaped,” said Albus. “Did your Patronus reach him?”The pounding in her heart grew stronger, the horror in her veins solidified. “He said he was here, in the washroom—”“Let us hope he spoke true,” said Albus, the wand tapped her head witha sensation like water trickling over her, and a moment later the four ofthem (even Fawkes had been rendered invisible, though sometimes yousaw a flicker of something like fire in his air) were racing to the frontof the restaurant. They paused before the door while Albus whisperedsomething, and a moment later one of the customers visible through thewindows stood up with a vague look on his face and opened the door asthough taking a quick look outside for some friend; and the three of themwere through, racing past the unwitting customers (Severus was marking their faces, Minerva knew, and Albus would see any Disillusioned)toward the sign that pointed to the washroom—An old wooden door marked with the sign of a toilet burst open witha slam, and four invisible rescuers stormed through it.The small but clean wooden room was empty, fresh droplets of watershowed in the sink but there was no sign of Harry, only a sheet of paperleft on the closed lid of the toilet.She couldn’t breathe.The sheet of paper rose up into the air as Albus took it, and a momentlater was thrust in her own direction.M: What did the hat tell me to tell you?“Ah,” Minerva said aloud in surprise, her mind taking a moment toplace the question, it wasn’t the sort of thing you’d forget but she hadn’t
932 *




been thinking in that mode, really—“I’m an impudent youngster and Ishould get off its lawn.”“Eh?” said the air in Albus’s voice, as if even he could be shocked.And then Harry Potter’s head appeared, suspended next to the air beside the toilet, his face was cold and alert, the too-adult Harry she’d seensometimes, eyes darting back and forth and around.“What’s going on—” the boy began.Albus, now visible once more along with her and Fawkes, was movingforward in an instant, his left hand reached forward and plucked a hairfrom Harry’s head (producing a startled yelp from the boy), Minerva accepted the hair in her own hand, and a moment later Albus swept up themostly-invisible boy in his arms and there was a flash of red-golden fire.And Harry Potter was safe.Minerva took a few steps forward, leaned against the wall where Albusand Harry had been, trying to recover her poise.She’d… lost some habits, in the ten years since the Order of thePhoenix had disbanded.Beside her, Severus shimmered into visibility. His right hand wasalready drawing forth the flask from his robes, his left hand alreadystretching forth in demand. She gave him Harry’s hair, and a momentlater, it dropped into the flask of unfinished Polyjuice, which at oncebegan fizzing and bubbling as it settled into the potency that wouldenable Severus to act his part as bait.“That was unexpected,” the Potions Master said slowly. “Why did ourHeadmaster not retrieve Mr. Potter earlier, I wonder, if he was going sofar as to twist Time? There should have been nothing preventing himfrom doing so… indeed, your Patronus should have found Mr. Potter already safe…”She hadn’t thought of that, a different realization having jumped tothe forefront of her mind. It wasn’t nearly as horrifying as Bellatrix Blackhaving escaped from Azkaban, but still—“Harry has an invisibility cloak?” she said.The Potions Master did not answer; he was shrinking.

Tick-snick, drip-blip, ding-ring-tingIt still annoyed her, though it faded past attention after a while; andwhen and if she became Headmistress, she intended to Silence the wholelot. Which Head of Hogwarts, she wondered, had first been so inconsiderate as to create a device that made noise, to pass on to their successors?She was sitting in the Headmaster’s office with a quickly Transfigured desk of her own, doing some of the hundred little pieces of necessary paperwork that kept Hogwarts from grinding to a halt; she couldlose herself in it easily, and it prevented her from thinking about otherthings. Albus had once remarked, sounding rather wry, that Hogwartsseemed to run even more smoothly when there was an outside crisis forher to avoid thinking about……ten years ago, that was the last time Albus had said that.There was the chime that indicated an approaching visitor.Minerva kept reading her current parchment.The door slammed open, revealing Severus Snape, who took threesteps inward and demanded without the slightest pause, “Any word fromMad-Eye?”Albus was already rising from his chair, even as she tucked away herparchments and dispelled the desk. “Moody’s Patronus is reporting tothe me in Azkaban,” Albus said. “His Eye saw nothing; and if the Eye ofVance does not see a thing, then that thing does not exist. Yourself?”“No one has tried to forcibly take my blood,” Severus said. He gave aquick grimace of a smile. “Except the Defense Professor.”“What?” said Minerva.“He saw me for an impostor before I could even open my lips, andquite reasonably attacked me on the spot, demanding to know the whereabouts of Mr. Potter.” Another grimace of a smile. “Shouting that I wasSeverus Snape did not seem to reassure him, for some reason. I do believe that man would kill me for a Sickle and give back five Knuts change.I had to stun our good Professor Quirrell, which was not easy, and then hereacted poorly to the hex. ‘Harry Potter’, naturally alarmed, ran out andtold the owner, and the Defense Professor was taken to St. Mungos—”
934 *




“St. Mungos?”“—which said he had probably been overworking himself for weeksbefore he collapsed, such was his state of exhaustion. Your precious Defense Professor is fine, Minerva, the stunner may have helped him by forcing him to take a few days off. Afterward I declined the offer of a Flooto Hogwarts, and went back to Diagon Alley and wandered; but no oneseems to have wanted Mr. Potter’s blood today.”“Our Defense Professor is in the best of hands, I am sure,” said Albus.“Greater matters command our attention, Minerva.”It took considerable effort for her to wrench her attention back, butshe sat back down, and Severus gestured up a chair for himself as well,and the three of them drew together to begin their council.She felt like a Polyjuiced impostor, sitting with those two. War wasnot her art, nor plotting. She had to strain to keep one step ahead of theWeasley twins, and sometimes she failed at that. She was sitting here,ultimately, only because she had heard the prophecy…“We are faced,” the Headmaster spoke first, “with a rather alarmingmystery. I can think of only two wizards who might have engineered thisescape.”Minerva drew in her breath sharply. “There is a chance it is not YouKnow-Who?”“I’m afraid so,” said the Headmaster.She glanced to her side and saw that Severus looked as puzzled asherself. Afraid the Dark Lord was not rising again? She would have givenalmost anything for that to be true.“So,” Albus said heavily. “Our first suspect is Voldemort, risen againand seeking to resurrect himself. I have studied many books I wish I hadnot read, seeking his every possible avenue of return, and I have foundonly three. His strongest road to life is the Philosopher’s Stone, whichFlamel assures me that not even Voldemort could create on his own; bythat road he would rise greater and more terrible than ever before. Iwould not have thought Voldemort able to resist the temptation of theStone, still less because such an obvious trap is a challenge to his wit. Buthis second avenue is nearly as strong: The flesh of his servant, willinglygiven; the blood of his foe, forcibly taken; and the bone of his ancestor,
935 *




unknowingly bequeathed. Voldemort is a perfectionist—” Albus glancedat Severus, who nodded agreement, “—and he would certainly seek themost powerful combination: the flesh of Bellatrix Black, the blood ofHarry Potter, and the bone of his father. Voldemort’s final avenue isto seduce a victim and drain the life from them over a long period; inwhich case Voldemort would be weak compared to his former power. Hismotive to spirit away Bellatrix is clear. And if he is keeping her in reserve,to use only in case he cannot attain the Stone, that would explain why nokidnap attempt was made on Harry this day.”Minerva glanced again at Severus, saw him listening attentively butwithout surprise.“What is not clear,” the Headmaster continued, “is how Voldemortcould have engineered this escape. A death doll was left in Bellatrix’splace, her escape was meant to be undetected; and even though thatwent wrong, the Dementors could not find her after their first warning.Azkaban has stood impenetrable for centuries, and I cannot imagine anymeans by which Voldemort could have accomplished this.”“That may mean little,” Severus said, expressionless. “For the DarkLord to do what we cannot imagine requires only that he has a betterimagination.”Albus nodded grimly. “Unfortunately there is now another wizardwho laughs at impossibilities. A wizard who, not long ago, developed anew and powerful Charm which could have blinded the Dementors to Bellatrix Black’s escape. And he is implicated for other reasons, as well.”Minerva’s heart was skipping beats, she didn’t know how, or why, buta terrible apprehension was dawning on her as to who—“Who would that be?” said Severus, sounding puzzled.Albus leaned back and said the fatal words, even as she had fearedthem: “Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres.”“Potter?” demanded the Potions Master, as much shock in that usuallysilken voice as she had ever heard from him. “Headmaster, is this one ofyour jokes? He is in his first year at Hogwarts! A temper tantrum and afew childish pranks with an invisibility cloak does not make him—”“It is no joke,” said Minerva, her voice barely above a whisper. “Harryis already making original discoveries in Transfiguration, Severus.
936 *




Though I did not know he was researching Charms as well.”“Harry is no ordinary first-year,” the Headmaster said solemnly. “Heis marked as the Dark Lord’s equal, and he has power the Dark Lordknows not.”Severus was looking at her, and you would have needed to know himwell to recognize that his glance was pleading. “Am I to take this seriously?”Minerva simply nodded.“Does anyone else know of this… new and powerful Charm?” Severusdemanded.The Headmaster glanced at her apologetically—Somehow she knew, she knew before he even said it, and she wantedto scream at the top of her lungs.—and said, “Quirinus Quirrell.”“Why,” she said, in a voice that should have melted half the devices inthe office, “did Mr. Potter even TELL our Defense Professor about his brilliantnew Charm for breaking out of prisons—”The Headmaster passed a weary wrinkled hand across his equallywrinkled forehead. “Quirinus just happened to be there, Minerva. EvenI saw no harm in it at the time.” The Headmaster hesitated. “And Harrysaid his Charm was too dangerous to be explained to either of us; andwhen I asked him again, this day, he insisted he had still not explainedit to Quirinus, nor had he ever dropped his Occlumency barriers in theDefense Professor’s presence—”“Mr. Potter is an Occlumens? You gave him an invisibility cloak and heis immune to Veritaserum and he is friends with the Weasley twins? Albus, doyou have any idea what you have unleashed upon this school?” Her voicewas nearly shrieking, now. “By his seventh year there won’t be anythingleft of Hogwarts but a smoking hole in the ground!”Albus leaned back in his great cushioned chair, and said, smiling,“Don’t forget the Time-Turner.”She did scream then, but quietly.Severus drawled, “Should I teach him to brew Polyjuice, Headmaster?I ask only for the sake of completeness, in case you are not satisfied withthe magnitude of your pet disaster.”
937 *




“Perhaps next year,” said Albus. “My dearest friends, the question before us is whether Harry Potter has spirited Bellatrix Black out of Azkaban, which is more than youthful high spirits even by my tolerant standards.”“Excuse me, Headmaster,” Severus said with one of the dryer smilesshe had ever seen him deliver to Albus, “but I will register my opinion thatthe answer is no. This is the Dark Lord’s work, pure and simple.”“Then why,” Albus said, and now there was no humor at all in his voice,“when I planned to retrieve Harry immediately after his arrival in DiagonAlley, did I find that this would result in paradox?”Minerva sank further back into her chair, dropped her left elbow ontothe hard uncushioned armrest, leaned her head into her hand, and shuther eyes in despair.There was a narrowly circulated proverb to the effect that only oneAuror in thirty was qualified to investigate cases involving Time-Turners;and that of those few, the half who weren’t already insane, soon would be.“So you suspect,” Severus’s voice was saying, “that Potter went fromDiagon Alley to Azkaban, then looped back to Diagon Alley afterward tobe picked up by us—”“Precisely,” said Albus’s voice. “Though it is also possible that Voldemort or his servants watched to make sure Harry did arrive in DiagonAlley, before they began their attempt on Azkaban. And that they hadsomeone with a Time-Turner who would send back the message of theirsuccess, to trigger the abduction. Indeed, it was my suspicion of this possibility that caused me to dispatch you and Minerva on your own mission, before I myself went to Azkaban. I thought then that their breakout would fail, but if retrieving Harry Potter meant observing the fact oftheir eventual failure, then I myself could not have gone to Azkaban after I had interacted with him, for Azkaban’s future cannot touch its past.When, in Azkaban, I received no report from you or Minerva, nor fromFlitwick whom I told to try contacting you, I knew that your interactionwith Harry Potter had been an interaction with Azkaban’s future, meaning that someone was sending messages through Time—”Then Albus’s voice stopped.
938 *




“But Headmaster,” said Severus, “you came back from Azkaban’s future and interacted with us…”The Potions Master’s voice trailed off.“But Severus, if I had received reports from you and Minerva of Harry’ssafety, I would not, in the first place, have gone backward in time to—”“Headmaster, I think we must draw diagrams for this.”“I agree, Severus.”There was the sound of parchment being spread on a table, and thenquills scratching, and more arguing.Minerva sat in her chair, head resting in her hand, eyes shut.There was a story she’d once heard about a criminal who had possessed a Time-Turner which the Department of Mysteries had sealed tohim, in a case of extremely bad judgment as to who needed one; and therehad been an Auror assigned to track down this unknown time-criminal,who had also been given a Time-Turner; and the story ended with both ofthem in St. Mungo’s ward for Total Unrecoverable Nutcases.Minerva sat there with her eyes shut, trying not to listen, trying notto think about it, and trying not to go insane.After awhile, when the argument seemed to have wound down, shesaid aloud, “Mr. Potter’s Time-Turner is restricted to the hours of ninePM through midnight. Was the shell tampered with, Albus?”“Not to my most discerning Charms,” said Albus. “But the shells arenew things; and to defeat the Unspeakables’ precautions and leave notrace of the defeat… might not be impossible.”She opened her eyes, and saw Severus and the Headmaster staringintently at a parchment covered with tangled squiggles that would haveno doubt driven her mad to comprehend.“Have you come to any conclusions?” Minerva said. “And please don’ttell me how you arrived at them.”Severus and the Headmaster looked at each other, then turned to lookat her.“We have concluded,” the Headmaster said gravely, “that either Harrywas involved or he was not; that either Voldemort has access to a TimeTurner or he does not; and that regardless of what could have happenedwithin Azkaban, nobody would have visited the Little Hangleton grave*
939 *




yard during the period Moody has already watched over it within my ownpast.”“In short,” Severus drawled, “we know nothing, dear Minerva; thoughit seems at least likely that another Time-Turner was involved, somehow.My own suspicion is that Potter has been bribed, tricked, or threatenedinto conveying messages backward in time, perhaps even regarding thisvery prison break. I shall not make the obvious suggestion as to who ispulling his strings. But I suggest that at nine o’ clock tonight, we testwhether Potter is able to travel the full six hours backward to three o’ clock,to see if he has yet used his Time-Turner.”“That seems wise to do in any case,” said Dumbledore. “See that done,Minerva, and tell Harry to stop in my office at his convenience, afterward.”“But you still suspect Harry of direct involvement in the prison breakitself?” Minerva said.“Possible but unlikely,” said Severus, at the same time Albus said,“Yes.”Minerva pinched the bridge of her nose, took a deep breath, let it out.“Albus, Severus, what possible reason has Mr. Potter to do such a thing!”“None that I can think of,” said Albus, “but it remains that Harry’smagics alone, of all the means known to me, might have—”“Hold,” said Severus. All expression vanished from his face. “Athought occurs to me, I must check—” The Potions Master seized a pinchof Floo powder, strode across the room toward the fireplace—Albushastily waved his wand to light it—and then in a flare of green flame,and the words “Slytherin Head of House office”, Severus was gone.She and Albus looked at each other and both shrugged; and then Albusturned back to studying the parchment.It was only a few minutes later that Severus spun back out of the Floo,brushing traces of ash from himself.“Well,” said the Potions Master. Again the expressionless face. “I amafraid that Mr. Potter does have a motive.”“Speak!” said Albus.“I found Lesath Lestrange in the Slytherin common room, studying,”Severus said. “He was not reluctant to meet my eyes. And it seems that




Mr. Lestrange did not like to think of his parents in Azkaban, in the coldand the darkness, with the Dementors sucking away their life, hurtingevery second of every day, and he told Mr. Potter so in as many words,and begged him to get them out. Since, you see, Mr. Lestrange had heardthat the Boy-Who-Lived could do anything.”She and Albus exchanged glances.“Severus,” Minerva said, “surely… even Harry… has more commonsense than that…”Her voice trailed off.“Mr. Potter thinks he is God,” Severus said without expression, “andLesath Lestrange fell to his knees before him in a heartfelt cry of prayer.”Minerva stared at Severus, feeling sick to her stomach. She hadstudied Muggle religion—it was the most common reason for needingto Memory-Charm the parents of Muggleborns—and she knew enoughto understand what Severus had just said.“In any case,” said the Potions Master. “I looked within Mr. Lestrangeto see if he knew anything of his mother’s escape. He has heard nothing.But the instant he learns, he will conclude that the person responsiblewas Harry Potter.”“I see…” Albus said slowly. “Thank you, Severus. That is good news.”“Good news?” Minerva burst out.Albus looked at her, his face as expressionless as Severus’s, now; andshe remembered, with a shock, that Albus’s own—“It is the best reasonI can possibly imagine for removing Bellatrix from Azkaban,” Albus saidquietly. “And if it is not Harry, let us recall, then it is certainly Voldemorthimself making his first moves. But let us not be hasty in judgment whilethere is much we do not yet know, but soon will.”Albus once more stood up from behind his desk, strode to the fireplace still alight, cast in another pinch of green powder, and stuck hishead into the flames. “Department of Magical Law Enforcement,” he said,“Director’s office.”After a moment, the voice of Madam Bones came through clear andsharp, “What is it, Albus? I am somewhat busy.”“Amelia,” said Albus, “I beg of you to share any discoveries you havemade concerning this matter.”






There was a pause. “Oh,” said the cold voice of Madam Bones fromthe blazing fire, “and is that a two-way road then, Albus?”“It may be,” the old wizard said calmly.“If any Auror dies of your reticence, old meddler, I will hold you responsible in full measure.”“I understand, Amelia,” Albus said, “but I have no wish to spark needless alarm and incredulity—”“Bellatrix Black has escaped from Azkaban! What alarm or incredulitydo you think I will call needless, in the face of that?”“I may call on you to remember those words,” said the old wizard intothe green flames. “For if I learn that my fears are not needless, I will tellyou. Now, Amelia, I beg you, if you have learned anything whatsoeverupon this matter, please share it.”There was another pause, and then Madam Bones’s voice said, “I haveinformation which I learned four hours into the future, Albus. Do you stillwant it?”Albus paused—(weighing, Minerva knew, the possibility that he might want to goback more than two hours from this instant; for you couldn’t send information further back in time than six hours, not through any chain ofTime-Turners)—and finally said, “Yes, please.”“We had a lucky break,” said Madam Bones’s voice, “one of the Aurors who witnessed the escape was a Muggleborn, and she told us thatthe Flying-Fire spell, as we were calling it, might be no spell at all, but aMuggle artifact.”Like a punch in the stomach, that was how it felt, and the sickness inMinerva’s belly redoubled. Anyone who’d watched a Chaos Legion battleknew whose hand that showed…Madam Bones’s voice continued. “We brought in Arthur Weasleyfrom Misuse of Muggle Artifacts—he knows more about Muggle artifacts than any wizard alive—and gave him the descriptions from theAurors on the scene, and he cracked it. It was a Muggle artifact called arocker, and they call it that because you’d have to be off your rocker toride one. Just six years ago one of their rockers blew up, killed hundreds

of Muggles in a flash and almost set fire to the Moon. Weasley says thatrockers use a special kind of science called opposite reaction, so the planis to develop a jinx which will prevent that science from working aroundAzkaban.”“Thank you, Amelia,” Albus said gravely. “Is that everything?”“I’ll check if we have anything from six hours forward,” said the voiceof Madam Bones, “if so they wouldn’t have told me, but I’ll have them tellyou. Do you have anything you want to tell me, Albus? Which of those twopossibilities is it looking like?”“Not yet, Amelia,” Albus said, “but I may have word for you soon.”He straightened up from the fire, then, which faded back to ordinaryyellow flames. Every minute of the old wizard’s years, every natural second since his birth and every second which Time-Turning had added, allof that plus a few extra decades for stress, was visible on his lined face.“Severus?” the old wizard said. “What was it actually?”“A rocket,” said the half-blood Potions Master, who had grown up inthe Muggle town of Spinner’s End. “One of the most impressive Muggletechnologies.”“How likely is Harry to know such arts?” said Minerva.Severus drawled, “Oh, a boy like Mr. Potter knows all about rockets;that, dear Minerva, is a certainty. You must remember that things aredone differently in the Muggle world.” Severus frowned. “But rockets aredangerous, and expensive…”“Harry has stolen and hidden an unknown amount of money fromhis Gringotts vault, perhaps thousands of Galleons,” said the Headmaster, and then, to their twin stares, “That was not in my plan, but Imade the mistake of sending the Defense Professor to supervise Harry’swithdrawal of five Galleons for Christmas presents…” The Headmastershrugged. “Yes, I agree, sheer folly in retrospect, let us continue.”Minerva quietly thudded her head a few times against the headrest ofher chair.“Nonetheless, Headmaster,” Severus said. “Just because the DeathEaters never used Muggle artifacts in the first war, that does not meanhe is ignorant. Rockets fell on Britain as weapons, in the Muggle side ofGrindelwald’s war. If he spent the summers of those years in a Muggle or*
943 *




phanage, as you told us, Headmaster… then he, too, has heard of rockets.And if he has been listening to reports of Mr. Potter and his mock battlesusing Muggle artifacts, he would certainly learn his enemy’s strengthsand try to redouble them himself. That is just how he thinks; any powerhe sees he will try to take for his own.”The old wizard was standing stock still, utterly motionless, even thehairs of his beard frozen in place like solid wires; and the thought came toMinerva, as frightening as any thought she’d ever had, that Albus Dumbledore was rooted to the spot in horror.“Severus,” Albus Dumbledore said, and his voice almost cracked, “doyou realize what you are saying? If Harry Potter and Voldemort fight theirwar with Muggle weapons there will be nothing left of the world but fire!”“What?” said Minerva. She had heard of guns, of course, but theyweren’t that dangerous to an experienced witch—Severus spoke as though she weren’t in the room. “Then perhaps,Headmaster, he is sending a deliberate warning to Harry Potter of exactly that; saying that any attack with Muggle weapons will be met withretaliation in kind. Command Mr. Potter to cease his use of Muggle technology in his battles; that will show him the message is received… and notgive him any more ideas.” Severus frowned. “Though, come to think ofit, Mr. Malfoy—and of course Miss Granger—well, on second thought ablanket prohibition on technology seems wiser—”The old wizard pressed both his hands to his forehead, and from hislips came an unsteady voice, “I begin to hope that it is Harry behind thisescape… oh, Merlin defend us all, what have I done, what have I done,what will become of the world?”Severus shrugged. “From the rumors I have heard, Headmaster, Muggle weapons are only slightly worse than the more… recondite aspects ofwizardry—”“Worse?” gasped Minerva, and then shut her mouth as though byforce.“Worse than any peril left in these fading years,” said Albus. “Notworse than that which erased Atlantis from Time.”Minerva stared at him, feeling the sweat break out all along her spine.
944 *




Severus continued, still addressing Albus. “All the Death Eaters saveBellatrix would have betrayed him, all his supporters turned against him,all the powers of the world converged to destroy him, if he had been reckless with any truly dangerous potency. Is this so different, then?”Some motion, some color, had returned to the old wizard’s face. “Perhaps not…”“And in any case,” Severus said with a slightly condescending smile,“Muggle weapons are not so easy to obtain, not for a thousand Galleonsor a thousand thousand.”Doesn’t Harry just Transfigure the devices he uses in his battles? thoughtMinerva, but before she could open her mouth to ask—The fireplace erupted in green flames, then, and the face of PiusThicknesse, Madam Bones’s assistant, appeared therein. “Chief Warlock?” said Thicknesse. “I have a report for you, transmitted from—”Thicknesse’s eyes flickered over Minerva and Severus, “six minutes ago.”“Six hours ahead, you mean,” said Albus. “These two are meant to hearit; deliver your report.”“We know how it was done,” said Thicknesse. “In Bellatrix Black’s cell,hidden in one corner, was a potions vial; and testing the traces of remaining fluid shows that it was an Animagus potion.”There was a long pause.“I see…” Albus said heavily.“Pardon me?” said Minerva. She didn’t.Thicknesse’s head turned toward her. “Animagi, Madam McGonagall,in their Animagus forms, are of less interest to Dementors. All prisonersare tested before their arrival at Azkaban; and if they are Animagi, theirAnimagus form is destroyed. But we had not considered that someoneprotected by a Patronus Charm while taking the potion and performingthe meditation, might be able to become an Animagus after they went toAzkaban—”“I understood,” Severus said, having by now put on his customarysneer, “that the Animagus meditation required considerable time.”“Well, Mr. Snape,” Thicknesse barked, “records show that BellatrixBlack was an Animagus before she was sentenced to Azkaban and her form

destroyed; so maybe her second meditation didn’t take as much time as herfirst!”“I would not have thought it possible for any prisoner of Azkaban to dosuch a thing…” Albus said. “But Bellatrix Black was a most powerful sorceress before her incarceration, and she might have done it if any witchcould. Can Azkaban be secured against this method?”“Yes,” said the confident head of Pius Thicknesse. “Our expert saysthat it is nigh-unimaginable that an Animagus meditation could be performed in less than three hours, regardless of experience. All visits toprisoners allowed to receive them will be limited to two hours henceforth,and the Dementors will inform us if any Patronus Charm is maintainedin the prison areas for longer than that.”Albus looked unhappy at that, but nodded. “I see. There will be nofurther attempts of that sort, of course, but do not relax your vigilance.And when Amelia has been told all this, tell her that I have informationfor her.”The head of Pius Thicknesse vanished without another word.“No further attempts…?” said Minerva.“Because, dear Minerva,” Severus drawled, having not quite taken offhis habitual sneer, “if the Dark Lord had planned to free any of his otherservants from Azkaban, he would not have left behind the vial of potionto tell us how it was done.” Severus frowned. “I confess… even so I do notsee why that vial was left there.”“It is some kind of message…” Albus said slowly. “And I cannot seewhat it means, not at all…” He drummed his fingers on his desk.For a long minute or three, the old wizard stared off into nothingness,frowning; while Severus also sat in silence.Then Albus shook his head in dismay, and said, “Severus, do you comprehend this?”“No,” said the Potions Master, and with a sardonic smile, “which isprobably all the better for us; whatever we are intended to conclude fromit, that part of his plan has misfired.”“You are certain, now, that it is You-Know… that it is Voldemort?” saidMinerva. “It could not be that some other Death Eater conceived thisclever notion?”
946 *




“And they knew about rockets, too?” Severus said dryly. “I don’t believe the other Death Eaters were so fond of Muggle Studies. It is he.”“Aye, it is he,” Albus said. “Azkaban has endured impenetrable forages, only to fall to an ordinary Animagus potion. It is too clever and tooimpossible, which was ever Voldemort’s signature since the days he wasknown as Tom Riddle. Anyone who wished to forge that signature mustneeds be as cunning as Voldemort himself to do so. And there is no oneelse in the world who would accidentally overestimate my wit, and leaveme a message I cannot understand at all.”“Unless he has gauged you exactly,” Severus said tonelessly, “in whichcase all that is just what he intended you to think.”Albus sighed. “Indeed. But even if he has tricked me perfectly, wemay at least rely on the conclusion that it was not Harry Potter.”It should have come as a relief, and yet Minerva felt the chill spreadingthrough her spine and her veins, her lungs and her bones.She remembered conversations like this.She remembered conversations like this from ten years ago, from atime when blood had run through Britain in wide rivers, when wizardsand witches she had once taught in class had been slaughtered by thehundreds, she remembered burning homes and screaming children andflashes of green light—“What will you tell Madam Bones?” she whispered.Albus stood from his desk and paced to the center of the room, hishand lightly touching the devices, here an instrument of light, there an instrument of sound; he adjusted his glasses with one hand, used the otherto center the long silver beard against his robes, and then finally that ancient wizard turned back and faced them.“I will tell her what little I know of the Dark Art called horcrux, bywhich a soul is deprived of death,” said Albus Dumbledore, in a soft voicethat seemed to fill the whole room, “and I will tell her what may be donewith the flesh of the servant.”“I will tell her that I am reconstituting the Order of the Phoenix.”“I will tell her that Voldemort has returned.”“And that the Second Wizarding War is begun.”

Some hours later…The antique old clock upon the wall of the Deputy Headmistress’soffice had golden hands, and silver numerals to make the clock-face;it ticked and jerked soundlessly through its motions, for there was aQuieting enchantment on it.The golden hour hand approached the silver numeral of nine, thegolden minute hand did the same, the two linked components of Timenearing each other, soon to be in the same place and never to collide.It was 8:43 pm, and the time approached when Harry’s Time-Turnerwould open, to be tested in the one way that no imaginable spell couldfool, unless that spell could bypass the laws of Time itself. No body orsoul, no knowledge or substance, could stretch an extra seven hours ina single day. She would make up a message on the spot, and tell Harryto take that message back six hours to Professor Flitwick at 3pm, and shewould ask Professor Flitwick if he had received it in that hour.And Professor Flitwick would tell her that he had indeed received it at3pm.And she would tell Severus and Albus to have a little more faith inHarry next time.Professor McGonagall cast the Patronus Charm, and told her shiningcat, “Go to Mr. Potter, and tell him this: Mr. Potter, please come to my office as soon as you hear this, without doing anything else along the way.”

948 *


inerva gazed up at the clock, the golden hands and silver numerals,the jerking motion. Muggles had invented that, and until theyhad, wizards had not bothered keeping time. Bells, timed by a sandedhourglass, had served Hogwarts for its classes when it was built. It wasone of the things that blood purists wished not to be true, and thereforeMinerva knew it.She had received an Outstanding on her Muggle Studies N.E.W.T.,which now seemed to her a mark of shame, considering how little sheknew. Her younger self had realized, even then, that the class was a sham,taught by a pureblood, supposedly because Muggleborns could not appreciate what wizardborns needed to be told, and actually because the Boardof Governors did not approve of Muggles at all. But when she was seventeen the Outstanding grade had been the main thing that mattered to her,she was saddened to remember…If Harry Potter and Voldemort fight their war with Muggle weapons there willbe nothing left of the world but fire!She couldn’t imagine it, and the reason she couldn’t imagine it wasthat she couldn’t imagine Harry fighting You-Know-Who.She had encountered the Dark Lord four times and survived each one,three times with Albus to shield her and once with Moody at her side.She remembered the damaged, snakelike face, the faint green scales scattered over the skin, the glowing red eyes, the voice that laughed in a highpitched hiss and promised nothing but cruelty and torment: the monsterpure and complete.


949 *




And Harry Potter was easy to picture in her mind, the bright expression on the face of a young boy who wavered between taking the ludicrousseriously and taking the serious ludicrously.And to think of the two of them facing off at wandpoint was toopainful to be imagined.They had no right, no right at all to set this on an eleven-year-old boy.She knew what the Headmaster had decided for him this day, for she hadbeen told to make the arrangements; and if it had been her at the sameage she would have raged and screamed and cried and been inconsolablefor weeks, and…He is no ordinary first-year, Albus had said. He is marked as the Dark Lord’sequal, and he has power the Dark Lord knows not.The terrible hollow voice booming from Sybill Trelawney’s throat, thetrue and original prophecy, echoed once more through her mind. She hada feeling it didn’t mean what the Headmaster thought it did, but therewas no way to put the difference into words.And even so it still seemed true, that if there were any eleven-year-oldwithin the Earth entire who could bear this burden, that boy approachedher office now. And if she said anything at all like ‘poor Harry’ to his face…well, he wouldn’t like it.So now I’ve got to find some way to kill an immortal Dark Wizard, Harryhad said on the day he had first learned. I really wish you had told me thatbefore I started shopping…She’d been Head of House Gryffindor for long enough, she’d watchedenough friends die, to know that there were some people you couldn’tsave from becoming heroes.There came a knock at the door, and Professor McGonagall said, “Enter.”When Harry entered, his face had the same cold, alert look she’d seenin Mary’s Place; and she wondered for an instant if he’d been wearing thatsame mask, that same self, this whole day.The young boy seated himself on the chair before her desk, and said,“So is it time for me to be told what’s going on?” Neutral the words, notthe sharpness that should have gone with the expression.
950 *




Professor McGonagall’s eyes rose in surprise before she could stopthem, and she said, “The Headmaster told you nothing, Mr. Potter?”The boy shook his head. “Only that he’d received a warning that Imight be in danger, but I was safe now.”Minerva was having trouble meeting his gaze. How could they do thisto him, how could they lay this upon an eleven-year-old boy, this war, thisdestiny, this prophecy… and they didn’t even trust him…She forced herself to look at Harry directly, and saw that his greeneyes were calm as they rested on her.“Professor McGonagall?” the boy said quietly.“Mr. Potter,” said Professor McGonagall, “I’m afraid it is not my placeto explain, but if after this the Headmaster still does not tell you anything,you may come back to me and I will go yell at him for you.”The boy’s eyes widened, something of the real Harry showing throughthe crack before the cool mask was set back in place.“In any case,” Professor McGonagall said briskly. “I’m sorry for theinconvenience, Mr. Potter, but I need to ask you to use your Time-Turnerto go back six hours to three o’clock, and give the following message toProfessor Flitwick: Silver on the tree. Ask the Professor to note down thetime at which you gave him that message. Afterward the Headmasterwishes to meet with you at your convenience.”There was a pause.Then the boy said, “I am suspected of misusing my Time-Turner,then?”“Not by me!” Professor McGonagall said hastily. “I am sorry for theinconvenience, Mr. Potter.”There was another pause, and then the young boy shrugged. “It’ll playhob with my sleep schedule but I suppose it can’t be helped. Please let thehouse elves know that if I ask for an early breakfast at, say, three A.M.tomorrow morning, I’m to receive it.”“Of course, Mr. Potter,” she said. “Thank you for understanding.”The boy rose up from his chair and gave her a formal nod, then slippedout the door with his hand already going under his shirt to where hisTime-Turner waited; and she almost called out Harry! only she wouldn’thave known what to say after.






Instead she waited, her eyes on the clock.How long did she need to wait for Harry Potter to go back in time?She didn’t need to wait at all, actually; if he had done it, then it hadalready happened…Minerva knew, then, that she was delaying because she was nervous,and the realization saddened her. Mischief, yes, unspeakable unthinkable mischief with all the prudence and foresight of a falling rock—shedidn’t know how the boy had tricked the Hat into not Sorting him to Gryffindor where he obviously belonged—but nothing dark or harmful, notever. Beneath that mischief his goodness ran as deep and as true as theWeasley twins’, though not even the Cruciatus Curse could have gottenher to say that out loud.“Expecto Patronum,” she said, and then, “Go to Professor Flitwick, andbear back his reply after you ask him this: ‘Did Mr. Potter give you a message from me, what was that message, and when did you receive it?’”
One hour earlier, having used the last remaining spin of his Time-Turnerafter putting on the Cloak of Invisibility, Harry tucked the hourglass backinto his shirt.And he set out toward the Slytherin dungeons, striding as quicklyas his invisible legs could manage, though not running. Thankfully theDeputy Headmistress’s office was already on a lower floor of Hogwarts…A few staircases later, taken two steps but not three steps at once,Harry stopped at a corridor around whose final bend lay the entrance tothe Slytherin dorms.Harry took a piece of parchment (not paper) out of his parch, took aQuotes Quill (not pen) out of his pouch, and told the quill, “Write theseletters exactly as I say them: Z-P-G-B-S-Y, space, F-V-Y-I-R-E-B-A-G-U-RG-E-R-R.”There were two kinds of codes in cryptography, codes that stoppedyour little brother from reading your message and codes that stopped major governments from reading your message, and this was the first kind
952 *




of code, but it was better than nothing. In theory, no one should read itanyway; but even if they did, they wouldn’t remember anything interesting unless they did cryptography first.Harry then put that parchment in a parchment envelope, and with hiswand melted a little green wax to seal it.In principle, of course, Harry could’ve done all that hours earlier, butsomehow waiting until after he heard the message from Professor McGonagall’s own lips seemed less like Messing With Time.Harry then put that envelope inside another envelope, which alreadycontained another sheet of paper with other instructions, and five silverSickles.He closed that envelope (which already had a name written on theoutside), sealed it with more green wax, and pressed a final Sickle intothat seal.Then Harry put that envelope into the very last envelope on which waswritten in large letters the name “Merry Tavington”.And Harry peeked around the bend to where the scowling portraitthat served as the door to the Slytherin dorms waited; and as he did notwish the portrait to recall not-seeing anyone invisible, Harry used theHover Charm to float the envelope to the scowling man, and tap it againsthim.The scowling man looked down at the envelope, peering at it througha monocle, and sighed, and turned around to face toward the inside ofthe Slytherin dorms, and called, “Message for Merry Tavington!”The envelope was then allowed to fall to the floor.A few moments later the portrait door opened, and Merry snatchedup the envelope from the floor.She would open it up and find a Sickle and an envelope addressed toa fourth-year student named Margaret Bulstrode.(Slytherins did this sort of thing all the time, and a Sickle definitelyconstituted a rush order.)Margaret would open her envelope, and find five Sickles along withan envelope to be dropped off in an unused classroom……after she used her Time-Turner to go back five hours…
953 *




…whereupon she would find another five Sickles waiting for her, ifshe got there quickly.And an invisible Harry Potter would be waiting in that classroomfrom three PM to three-thirty, just in case someone tried the obvioustest.Well, it had been obvious to Professor Quirrell, anyway.It had also been obvious to Professor Quirrell that (a) Margaret Bulstrode had a Time-Turner and (b) she wasn’t very strict about how sheused it, e.g. telling her younger sister really good pieces of gossip “before”anyone else had heard.Some of the tension leaked off Harry as he strode away from the portrait door, still invisible. Somehow his mind had still managed to worryabout the plan, even knowing that it had already succeeded. Now thereremained only the confrontation with Dumbledore, and then he wasdone for the day… he’d go to the Headmaster’s gargoyles at 9pm, sincedoing it at 8pm would seem more suspicious. This way he could claimthat he’d just misunderstood what Professor McGonagall had meant by“afterward”…The obscure pain clutched at Harry’s heart again as he thought of Professor McGonagall.So Harry retreated a little further into his dark side, which had wornthe calm expression and kept the fatigue off his face, and kept walking.There would come a reckoning, but sometimes you had to borrow everything you could today, and let the payments come due tomorrow.
Even Harry’s dark side was feeling the exhaustion by the time the spiraling staircase had delivered him to the great oaken door that was the finalgate to Dumbledore’s office; but since Harry was now legally four hourspast his natural bedtime, it was safe to let some of the fatigue show, thephysical if not the emotional.The oaken door swung open—
954 *




Harry’s eyes had already been focused in the direction of the greatdesk, the throne behind it; so it took a moment to register that the thronewas empty, the desk barren but for a single leatherbound volume; andthen Harry shifted his gaze to see the wizard standing among his fiddly things, the mysterious unknown devices in their scores. Fawkes andthe Sorting Hat occupied their respective perches, a bright cheerful blazecrackled in a nook that Harry had not before realized was a fireplace, andthere were the two umbrellas and three red slippers for left feet. All thingsin their place and in their customary appearance except the old wizardhimself, standing tall and dressed in robes of the most formal black. Itcame as a shock to the eyes, those robes on that person, it was as if Harryhad seen his father wearing a business suit.Very ancient was the appearance of Albus Dumbledore, and sorrowful.“Hello, Harry,” said the old wizard.From within an alternate self maintained like an Occlumency construct, an innocent-Harry who had absolutely no idea what was happening inclined his head coldly, and said, “Headmaster. I expect you’ve heardback from Deputy Headmistress McGonagall by now, so if it’s fine by you,I would really like to know what is going on.”“Yes,” said the old wizard, “it is time, Harry Potter.” The back straightened, only slightly for the wizard had already been standing straight; butsomehow even that small change made the wizard seem a foot taller, andstronger if not younger, formidable though not dangerous, his potencygathered about him like a cowl. In a clear voice, then, he spoke: “This dayyour war against Voldemort has begun.”“What?” said the outer Harry who knew nothing, while somethingwatching from inside thought much the same only with a lot more profanity attached.“Bellatrix Black has been taken from Azkaban, she has escaped froma prison inescapable,” the old wizard said. “It is a feat that bears Voldemort’s signature if ever I have seen it; and she, his most faithful servant,is one of three requisites he must obtain to rise again in a new body. Afterten years the enemy you once defeated has returned, as was foretold.”
955 *




Neither part of Harry could think of anything to say to that, at leastnot for the few seconds before the old wizard continued.“It need change little for you, for now,” said the old wizard. “I havebegun reconstituting the Order of the Phoenix that will serve you, I havealerted the few souls who can and should understand: Amelia Bones,Alastor Moody, Bartemius Crouch, certain others. Of the prophecy—yes,there is a prophecy—I have not told them, but they know that Voldemortis returned, and they know that you are to play some vital role. They andI shall fight your war in its lesser beginnings, while you grow stronger,and perhaps wiser, here at Hogwarts.” The old wizard’s hand came up,as though beseeching. “So to you, for now, there is but one change, andI implore you to understand its necessity. Do you recognize the book onmy desk, Harry?”The inner part of Harry was screaming and banging its head againstimaginary walls, while the outer Harry turned and stared at what provedto be—There was a rather long pause.Then Harry said, “It is a copy of The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien.”“You recognized a quote from that book,” said Dumbledore, an intentlook in his eyes, “so I assume you remember it well. If I am mistaken, letme be corrected.”Harry just stared at him.“It is important to understand,” said Dumbledore, “that this book isnot a realistic depiction of a wizarding war. John Tolkien never foughtVoldemort. Your war will not be like the books you have read. Real life isnot like stories. Do you understand, Harry?”Harry, rather slowly, nodded yes; and then shook his head no.“In particular,” said Dumbledore, “there is a certain very foolishthing that Gandalf does in the first book. He makes many mistakes,does Tolkien’s wizard; but this one error is the most unforgivable. Thatmistake is this: When Gandalf first suspected, even for a moment, thatFrodo held the One Ring, he should have moved Frodo to Rivendell atonce. He might have been embarrassed, that old wizard, if his suspicionshad proven false. He might have found it awkward to so commandFrodo, and Frodo would have been greatly inconvenienced, needing to
956 *




set aside many other plans and pastimes. But a little embarrassment,and awkwardness, and inconvenience, is as nothing compared to theloss of your whole war, when the nine Nazgul swoop down on the Shirewhile you are reading old scrolls in Minas Tirith, and take the Ring atonce. And it is not Frodo alone who would have been hurt; all MiddleEarth would have fallen into slavery. If it had not been only a story, Harry,they would have lost their war. Do you understand what I am saying?”“Er…” said Harry, “not exactly…” There was something about Dumbledore when he was like this, which made it hard to stay properly cold; hisdark side had trouble with weird.“Then I will spell it out,” said the old wizard. His voice was stern,his eyes were sad. “Frodo should have been moved to Rivendell at onceby Gandalf himself—and Frodo should never have left Rivendell withoutguard. There should have been no night of terror in Bree, no Barrowdowns, no Weathertop where Frodo was wounded, they could have losttheir entire war any of those times, for Gandalf’s folly! Do you understand now what I am saying to you, son of Michael and Petunia?”And the Harry who knew nothing did understand.And the Harry who knew nothing saw that it was the smart, the wise,the intelligent and sane, the right thing to do.And the Harry who knew nothing said just what an innocent Harrywould have said, while the silent watcher screamed in confusion andagony.“You’re saying,” Harry said, his voice shaking as the emotions insideburned through the outer calm, “that I’m not going home to my parentsfor Easter.”“You will see them again,” the old wizard said swiftly. “I will beg themto come here to be with you, I will extend them every courtesy duringtheir visits. But you are not going home for Easter, Harry. You are notgoing home for the summer. You are no longer taking lunches in DiagonAlley, even with Professor Quirrell to watch you. Your blood is the secondrequisite Voldemort needs to rise as strong as before. So you are neveragain leaving the bounds of Hogwarts’s wards without a vital reason, anda guard strong enough to fend off any attack for long enough to get youto safety. ”
957 *




Water was beginning at the corners of Harry’s eyes. “Is that a request?” said his quavering voice. “Or an order?”“I’m sorry, Harry,” the old wizard said softly. “Your parents will seethe necessity, I hope; but if not… I am afraid they have no recourse; thelaw, however wrongly, does not recognize them as your guardians. I amsorry, Harry, and I will understand if you despise me for it, but it must bedone.”Harry whirled, looked at the door, he couldn’t look at Dumbledore anymore, couldn’t trust his own face.This is the cost to yourself, said Hufflepuff within his mind, even as youimposed costs on others. Will that change your whole view of the matter, the wayProfessor Quirrell thinks it will?Automatically, the mask of the innocent Harry said exactly what itwould have said: “Are my parents in danger? Do they need to be movedhere?”“No,” said the old wizard’s voice. “I do not think so. The Death Eaterslearned, toward the end of the war, not to attack the Order’s families. Andif Voldemort is now acting without his former companions, he still knowsthat it is I who make the decisions for now, and he knows that I would givehim nothing for any threat to your family. I have taught him that I do notgive in to blackmail, and so he will not try.”Harry turned back then, and saw a coldness on the old wizard’s face tomatch the shift in his voice, Dumbledore’s blue eyes grown hard as steelbehind the glasses, it didn’t match the person but it matched the formalblack robes.“Is that everything, then?” said Harry’s trembling voice. Later hewould think about this, later he would think of some cunning countermeasure, later he would ask Professor Quirrell if there was any way toconvince the Headmaster he was mistaken. Right now, maintaining themask was taking all of Harry’s attention.“Voldemort used a Muggle artifact to escape Azkaban,” the old wizardsaid. “He is watching you and learning from you, Harry Potter. Soon aman named Arthur Weasley at the Ministry will issue an edict that all useof Muggle artifacts must cease in the Defense Professor’s battles. In thefuture, when you have a good idea, keep it closer about yourself.”
958 *




It didn’t seem important by comparison. Harry just nodded, and saidagain, “Is that everything?”There was a pause.“Please,” said the old wizard in a whisper. “I have no right to askyour forgiveness, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, but please, at leastsay that you understand why.” There was water in the old wizard’s eyes.“I understand,” said the voice of the outer Harry who did understand,“I mean… I was sort of thinking about it anyway… wondering whether Icould get you and my parents to let me stay over at Hogwarts during thesummer like the orphans, so I could read the library here, it’s just moreinteresting at Hogwarts anyway…”A choking sound came from Albus Dumbledore’s throat.Harry turned again toward the door. It wasn’t escape unscathed, butit was escape.He took a step forward.His hand reached to the door-handle.A piercing cry split the air—As though in slow motion, as Harry spun, he saw the phoenix alreadylaunched through the air and winging toward him.From the true Harry, the one who knew his own guilt, came a flash ofpanic, he hadn’t thought of that, hadn’t anticipated it, he’d prepared toface Dumbledore but he’d forgotten about Fawkes—Flap, flap, and flap, three times the phoenix’s wings flapped like theflaring up and dying down of a fire, duration seemed to pass too slowlyas Fawkes soared over the mysterious devices toward where Harry stood.And the red-golden bird was hovering in front of him with gentlewing-sweeps, bobbing in the air like a candle-flame.“What is it, Fawkes?” said the false Harry in puzzlement, looking thephoenix in the eyes, as he would if he were innocent. The real Harry, feeling the same awful sickness inside as when Professor McGonagall hadexpressed her trust in him, thought, Did I turn evil today, Fawkes? I didn’tthink I was evil… Do you hate me now? If I’ve become something a phoenix hates,maybe I should just give it up now, give up everything now and confess—Fawkes screamed, the most terrible cry Harry had ever heard, ascream that set all the devices vibrating and made all the sleeping figures
959 *




start within their portraits.It pierced through all of Harry’s defenses like a white-hot swordthrough butter, collapsed all his layers like a punctured balloon popping,reshuffled his priorities in an instant as he remembered the one mostimportant thing; the tears began pouring freely from Harry’s eyes, downhis cheeks, his voice choked as the words came out of his throat likecoughing up lava—“Fawkes says,” Harry’s voice said, “he wants me, to do, something,about, the prisoners, in Azkaban—”“Fawkes, no!” said the old wizard. Dumbledore strode forward, reaching out to the phoenix with a pleading hand. The old wizard’s voice wasalmost as desperate as the phoenix’s scream had been. “You cannot askthat of him, Fawkes, he’s only a boy still!”“You went to Azkaban,” Harry whispered, “you took Fawkes with you,he saw—you saw—you were there, you saw—WHY DIDN’T YOU DO ANYTHING? WHY DIDN’T YOU LET THEM OUT?”When the instruments stopped vibrating, Harry realized that Fawkeshad screamed at the same time as his own scream, that the phoenix wasnow flying next to Harry and facing Dumbledore at his side, the redgolden head level with his own.“Can you,” whispered the old wizard, “can you truly hear the voice ofthe phoenix so clearly?”Harry was sobbing almost too hard to speak, for all the metal doorshe’d passed, the voices he’d heard, the worst memories, the desperatebegging as he walked away, all of it had burst into his mind like fire atthe phoenix’s scream, all the inner bulwarks smashed. Harry didn’t knowwhether he could truly hear the voice of the phoenix so clearly, whether hewould have understood Fawkes without already knowing. All Harry knewwas that he had a plausible excuse to say the things Professor Quirrell hadtold him he must never raise in conversation from this day forth; becausethis was just what an innocent Harry would have said, would have done,if he had heard so clearly. “They’re hurting—we have to help them—”“I can’t!” cried Albus Dumbledore. “Harry, Fawkes, I can’t, there’s nothing I can do!”Another piercing scream.




The old wizard wrenched his gaze from the phoenix, his eyes meeting Harry’s instead. “Harry, tell Fawkes for me! Tell him it’s not that simple! Phoenixes aren’t mere animals but they are animals, Harry, they can’tunderstand—”“I don’t understand either,” Harry said, his voice trembling. “I don’tunderstand why you’re feeding people to Dementors! Azkaban isn’t a prison,it’s a torture chamber and you’re torturing those people to DEATH!”“Percival,” said the old wizard hoarsely, “Percival Dumbledore, myown father, Harry, my own father died in Azkaban! I know, I know it is ahorror! But what would you have of me? To break Azkaban by force? Wouldyou have me declare open rebellion against the Ministry?”There was a pause, and Harry’s trembling voice said, “Fawkes doesn’tknow anything about governments, he just wants you—to take the prisoners out—of their cells—and he’ll help you fight, if anyone stands inyour way—and—and so will I, Headmaster! I’ll go with you and destroyany Dementor that comes near! We’ll worry about the political falloutafterward, I bet that you and I together could get away with it—”“Harry,” whispered the old wizard, “phoenixes do not understandhow winning a battle can lose a war.” Tears were streaming down theold wizard’s cheeks, dripping into his silver beard. “The battle is all theyknow. They are good, but not wise. That is why they choose wizards tobe their masters.”“Can you bring out the Dementors to where I can get at them?”Harry’s voice was begging, now. “Bring them out in groups of fifteen—Ithink I could destroy that many at a time without hurting myself—”The old wizard shook his head. “It was hard enough to pass off theloss of one—they might give me one more, but never two—they are considered national possessions, Harry, weapons in case of war—”Fury blazed in Harry then, blazed up like fire, it might have come fromwhere a phoenix now rested on his own shoulder, and it might have comefrom his own dark side, and the two angers mixed within him, the coldand the hot, and it was a strange voice that said from his throat, “Tellme something. What does a government have to do, what do the voters






have to do with their democracy, what do the people of a country have todo, before I ought to decide that I’m not on their side any more?”The old wizard’s eyes widened where he stared at the boy with aphoenix upon his shoulder. “Harry… are those your words, or the Defense Professor’s—”“Because there has to be some point, doesn’t there? And if it’s not Azkaban, where is it, then?”“Harry, listen, please, hear me! Wizards could not live together if theyeach declared rebellion against the whole, every time they differed! Always there will be something—”“Azkaban is not just something! It’s evil!”“Yes, even evil! Even some evils, Harry, for wizards are not perfectlygood! And yet it is better that we live in peace, than in chaos; and for youand I to break Azkaban by force would be the beginning of chaos, can younot see it?” The old wizard’s voice was pleading. “And it is possible tooppose the will of your fellows openly or in secret, without hating them,without declaring them evil and enemy! I do not think the people of thiscountry deserve that of you, Harry! And even if some of them did—whatof the children, what of the students in Hogwarts, what of the many goodpeople mixed in with the bad?”Harry looked on his shoulder at where Fawkes had perched, saw thephoenix’s eyes gazing back at him, they did not glow and yet they blazed,red flames in a sea of golden fire.What do you think, Fawkes?“Caw?” said the phoenix.Fawkes didn’t understand the conversation.The young boy looked at the old wizard, and said in a thick voice, “Ormaybe the phoenixes are wiser than us, smarter than us, maybe they follow us around hoping that someday we’ll listen to them, someday we’ll getit, someday we’ll just take, the prisoners, out, of their cells—”Harry spun and pulled open the oaken door and stepped onto thestaircase and slammed the door behind him.The stairwell began rotating, Harry began descending, and he put hisface in his hands, and began to weep.

It wasn’t until he was halfway to the bottom that he noticed the difference, noticed the warmth still spreading through him, and realizedthat—“Fawkes?” Harry whispered.—the phoenix was still on his shoulder, perched there as he had seenhim a few times upon Dumbledore’s.Harry looked again into the eyes, red flames in golden fire.“You’re not my phoenix now… are you?”Caw!“Oh,” Harry said, his voice trembling a little, “I’m glad to hearthat, Fawkes, because I don’t think—the Headmaster—I don’t thinkhe deserves—”Harry stopped, took a breath.“I don’t think he deserves that, Fawkes, he was trying to do the rightthing…”Caw!“But you’re angry at him and trying to make a point. I understand.”The phoenix nestled his head against Harry’s shoulder, and the stonegargoyle walked smoothly aside to let Harry pass back into the corridorsof Hogwarts.

Aftermath, Hermione Granger:She was just starting to close up her books and put away her homework in preparation for sleep, Padma and Mandy stacking up their ownbooks across the table from her, when Harry Potter walked into theRavenclaw common room; and it was only then that she realized, shehadn’t seen him at all since breakfast.That realization was rapidly stomped-on by a much more startlingone.There was a golden-red winged creature on Harry’s shoulder, a brightbird of fire.And Harry looked sad and worn and really tired like the phoenix wasthe only thing keeping him on his feet, but there was still a warmth abouthim, if you crossed your eyes you might have thought you were lookingat the Headmaster somehow, that was the impression that went throughHermione’s mind even though it didn’t make any sense.Harry Potter trudged across the Ravenclaw common room, past sofasfull of staring girls, past cardgame-circles of staring boys, heading forher.In theory she wasn’t talking to Harry Potter yet, his week wasn’t upuntil tomorrow, but whatever was going on was clearly a whole lot moreimportant than that—
965 *




“Fawkes,” Harry said, just as she was opening her mouth, “that girlover there is Hermione Granger, she’s not talking to me right now because I’m an idiot, but if you want to be on a good person’s shoulder she’sbetter than me.”So much exhaustion and hurt in Harry Potter’s voice—But before she could figure out what to do about it, the phoenix hadglided off Harry’s shoulder like a fire creeping up a matchstick on fastforward, flashing toward her; there was a phoenix flying in front of herand staring at her with eyes of light and flame.“Caw?” asked the phoenix.Hermione stared at it, feeling like she was facing a question on a testshe’d forgotten to study for, the one most important question and she’dgone her whole life without studying for it, she couldn’t find anything tosay.“I’m—” she said. “I’m only twelve, I haven’t done anything yet—”The phoenix just glided gently around, rotating around one wingtiplike the being of light and air that it was, and soared back to Harry Potter’sshoulder, where it settled down quite firmly.“You silly boy,” said Padma across from her, looking like she was deciding whether to laugh or grimace, “phoenixes aren’t for smart girls whodo their homework, they’re for idiots who charge straight at five olderSlytherin bullies. There’s a reason why the Gryffindor colors are red andgold, you know.”There was a lot of friendly laughter in the Ravenclaw common room.Hermione wasn’t one of the laughing ones.Neither was Harry.Harry had put a hand over his face. “Tell Hermione I’m sorry,” hesaid to Padma, his voice almost fallen to a whisper. “Tell her I forgot thatphoenixes are animals, they don’t understand time and planning, theydon’t understand people who are going to do good things later—I’m notsure they understand really the notion of there being something that aperson is, all they see is what people do. Fawkes doesn’t know what twelvemeans. Tell Hermione I’m sorry—I shouldn’t have—it just all goes wrong,doesn’t it?”
966 *




Harry turned to go, the phoenix still on his shoulder, began slowlytrudging toward the staircase that led up to his dorm.And Hermione couldn’t leave it at that, she just couldn’t leave it at that.She didn’t know if it was her competition with Harry or something else.She just couldn’t leave it with the phoenix turning away from her.She had to—Her mind keyed a frantic question to the entirety of her excellentmemory, found just one thing—“I was going to run in front of the Dementor to try and save Harry!”she shouted a little desperately at the red-golden bird. “I mean, I actually did start running and everything! That was stupid and courageous,right?”With a warbling cry the phoenix launched itself from Harry’s shoulder again, back toward her like a spreading blaze, it circled her threetimes like she was the center of an inferno, and for just a moment its wingbrushed against her cheek, before the phoenix soared back to Harry.There was a hush in the Ravenclaw common room.“Told you so,” Harry said aloud, and then he started climbing thestairs up to his bedroom; he seemed to climb very quickly, like he wasvery light on his feet for some reason, so that in just a moment he andFawkes were gone.Hermione held up a trembling hand to her cheek where Fawkes hadbrushed her with his wing, a spot of warmth lingering there like that onesmall patch of skin had been very gently set on fire.She’d answered the question of the phoenix, she supposed, but it feltto her like she’d just barely squeaked by on the test, like she’d gotten a 62and she could’ve gotten 104 if she’d tried harder.If she’d tried at all.She hadn’t really been trying, when she thought about it.Just doing her homework—Who have you saved?


967 *




Aftermath, Fawkes:Nightmares, the boy had expected, screams and begging and howlinghurricanes of emptiness, the discharge of the horrors being laid downinto memory, and in that fashion, perhaps, becoming part of the past.And the boy knew that the nightmares would come.The next night, they would come.The boy dreamed, and in his dreams the world was on fire, Hogwartswas on fire, his home was on fire, the streets of Oxford were on fire, allablaze with golden flames that shone but did not consume, and all thepeople walking through the blazing streets were shining with white lightbrighter than the fire, like they were flames themselves, or stars.The other first-year boys came to bed, and saw it for themselves, thewonder whose rumor they had already heard, that in his bed Harry Potterlay silent and motionless, a gentle smile on his face, while perched onhis pillow a red-golden bird watched over him, with bright wings sweptabove him like a blanket pulled over his head.The reckoning had been put off one more night.
Aftermath, Draco Malfoy:Draco straightened his robes, making sure the green trim wasstraight. He waved his wand over his own head and said a Charm thatFather had taught him while other children were still playing in mud, aCharm which ensured that not a single speck of lint or dust would dirtyhis wizard’s robes.Draco picked up the mysterious envelope that Father had owled him,and tucked it into his robes. He had already used Incendio and Everto onthe mysterious note.And then he headed off to breakfast, to seat himself on exactly thesame tick of the clock where the food appeared, if he could manage it, sothat it would seem like all others had been waiting on his appearance to
968 *




eat. Because when you were the scion of Malfoy you were first in everything, including breakfast, that was why.Vincent and Gregory were waiting for him outside the door of his private room, up even before he was—though not, of course, dressed quiteas sharply.The Slytherin common room was deserted, anyone who got up thisearly was heading straight to breakfast anyway.The dungeon halls were silent but for their own footsteps, empty andechoing.The Great Hall was a hubbub of alarm despite the relative few arrivals,some younger children crying, students running back and forth betweentables or standing in knots shouting at each other, a red-robed prefectwas standing in front of two green-trimmed students and yelling at themand Snape was striding toward the mess—The noise dimmed a little as people caught sight of Draco, as some ofthe faces turned to stare at him, and fell quiet.The food appeared on the tables. No one looked at it.And Snape spun on his heel, abandoning his target, and headedstraight toward Draco.A knot of fear clutched at Draco’s heart, had something happened toFather—no, surely Father would have told him—whatever was happening, why hadn’t Father told him—There were bags of fatigue beneath Snape’s eyes, Draco saw as theirHead of House came close, the Potions Master had never been a sharpdresser (that was an understatement) but his robes were even dirtier andmore disarrayed this morning, spotted with extra grease.“You haven’t heard?” hissed their Head of House as he came close.“For pity’s sake, Malfoy, don’t you have a newspaper delivered?”“What is it, Profe—”“Bellatrix Black was taken from Azkaban!”“What?” said Draco in shock, as Gregory behind him said somethinghe really shouldn’t have and Vincent just gasped.Snape was gazing at him with narrowed eyes, then nodded abruptly.“Lucius told you nothing, then. I see.” Snape gave a snort, turned away—
969 *




“Professor!” said Draco. The implications were just starting to dawnon him, his mind spinning frantically. “Professor, what should I do—Father didn’t instruct me—”“Then I suggest,” Snape said sneeringly, as he strode away, “that youtell them that, Malfoy, as your father intended!”Draco glanced back at Vincent and Gregory, though he didn’t knowwhy he was bothering, of course they looked even more confused than hedid.And Draco walked forward to the Slytherin table, and sat down at thefar end, which was still empty of sitters.Draco put a sausage omelet on his plate, began eating it with automatic motions.Bellatrix Black had been taken from Azkaban.Bellatrix Black had been taken from Azkaban…?Draco didn’t know what to make of that, it was as totally unexpectedas the Sun going out—well, the Sun would expectedly go out in six billionyears but this was as unexpected as the Sun going out tomorrow. Fatherwouldn’t have done it, Dumbledore wouldn’t have done it, no one shouldhave been able to do it—what did it mean—what use would Bellatrix beto anyone after ten years in Azkaban—even if she got strong again, whatuse was a powerful sorceress who was completely evil and insane and fanatically devoted to a Dark Lord who wasn’t around anymore?“Hey,” said Vincent from where he was sitting next to Draco, “I don’tunderstand, boss, why’d we do that?”“We didn’t do it, you dolt!” snapped Draco. “Oh, for Merlin’s sake,if even you think we—didn’t your father ever tell you any stories aboutBellatrix Black? She tortured Father once, she tortured your father, she’stortured everyone, the Dark Lord once told her to Crucio herself and shedid it! She didn’t do crazy things to inspire fear and obedience in the populace, she did crazy things because she’s crazy! She’s a bitch is what sheis!”“Oh, really?” said an incensed voice from behind Draco.Draco didn’t look up. Gregory and Vincent would be watching hisback.“I would’ve thought you’d be happy—”
970 *




“—to hear that a Death Eater had been freed, Malfoy!”Amycus Carrow had always been one of the other problem people; Father had once told Draco to make sure he was never alone in the sameroom with Amycus…Draco turned around and gave Flora and Hestia Carrow his Number Three Sneer, the one that said that he was in a Noble and Most Ancient House and they weren’t and yes, that mattered. Draco said in theirgeneral direction, certainly not deigning to address them in particular,“There’s Death Eaters and then there’s Death Eaters,” and then turnedback to his food.There were two furious huffs in unison, and then two pairs of shoesstormed off toward the other end of the Slytherin table.It was a few minutes later that Millicent Bulstrode ran up to them,visibly out of breath, and said, “Mr. Malfoy, did you hear?”“About Bellatrix Black?” said Draco. “Yeah—”“No, about Potter!”“What?”“Potter was going around with a phoenix on his shoulder last night,looking like he’d been dragged through ten leagues of mud, they say thatthe phoenix took him to Azkaban to try to stop Bellatrix and he fought aduel with her and they blew up half the fortress!”“What?” said Draco. “Oh, there is just no way that—”Draco stopped.He’d said that a number of times about Harry Potter and had startedto notice a trend.Millicent ran off to tell someone else.“You don’t really think—” said Gregory.“I honestly don’t know anymore,” said Draco.A few minutes later, after Theodore Nott had sat down across fromhim and William Rosier had gone to sit with the Carrow twins, Vincentnudged him and said, “There.”Harry Potter had entered the Great Hall.Draco watched him closely.There was no alarm on Harry’s face as he saw, no surprise or shock,he just looked…






It was the same distant, self-absorbed look Harry wore when he wastrying to figure out the answer to a question Draco couldn’t understandyet.Draco hastily shoved himself up from the bench of the Slytherin table,saying “Stay behind,” and walked with all decorous speed toward Harry.Harry seemed to notice his approach just as the other boy was turningtoward the Ravenclaw table, and Draco——gave Harry one quick look——and then walked right past him, straight out of the Great Hall.It was a minute later that Harry peered around the corner of the smallstony nook where Draco had waited, it might not fool everyone but itwould create plausible deniability.“Quietus,” said Harry. “Draco, what—”Draco took the envelope out of his robes. “I have a message for youfrom Father.”“Huh?” said Harry, and took the envelope from Draco, and tore it openin a rather un-neat manner, and drew forth a sheet of parchment andunfolded it and—Harry gave a sharp intake of breath.Then Harry looked at Draco.Then Harry looked back down at the parchment.There was a pause.Harry said, “Did Lucius tell you to report on my reaction to this?”Draco paused for a moment, weighing, and then opened his mouth—“I see he did,” said Harry, and Draco cursed himself, he should’veknown better, only it had been hard to decide. “What are you going totell him?”“That you were surprised,” said Draco.“Surprised,” Harry said flatly. “Yeah. Good. Tell him that.”“What is it?” said Draco. And then, as he saw Harry looking conflicted,“If you’re dealing with Father behind my back—”And Harry, without a word, gave Draco the paper.It said:I know it was you.
972 *




“I was going to ask you that,” said Harry. “Have you got any idea what’sup with your Dad?”Draco stared at Harry.Then Draco said, “Did you do it?”“What?” said Harry. “What possible reason would I—how would I—”“Did you do it, Harry?”“No!” Harry said. “Of course not!”Draco had listened carefully, but he hadn’t detected any hesitation ortremor.So Draco nodded, and said, “I’ve got no idea what Father’s thinkingbut it can’t, I mean it can’t possibly be good. And, um… people are also saying…”“What,” said Harry warily, “are they saying, Draco?”“Did a phoenix really take you to Azkaban to try to stop Bellatrix Blackfrom escaping—”
Aftermath: Neville LongbottomHarry had only just sat down at the Ravenclaw table for the first time,hoping to grab a quick bite of food. He knew he needed to go off andthink about things, but there was a tiny remaining bit of phoenix’s peace(even after the encounter with Draco) that he still wanted to cling to, somebeautiful dream of which he remembered nothing but the beauty; andthe part of him that wasn’t feeling peaceful was waiting for all the anvilsto finish dropping on him, so that when he went off to think and be byhimself for a while, he could batch-process all the disasters at once.Harry’s hand grasped a fork, lifted a bite of mashed potatoes towardhis mouth—And there was a shriek.Every now and then someone would shout when they heard the news,but Harry’s ears recognized this one—Harry was up from the bench in an instant, heading toward the Hufflepuff table, a horrible sick feeling dawning in the pit of his stomach. It
973 *




was one of those things he hadn’t considered when he’d decided to commit the crime, because Professor Quirrell had planned for no one to know;and now, afterward, Harry just—hadn’t thought of it—This, Hufflepuff said with bitter intensity, is also your fault.But by the time Harry got there, Neville was sitting down and eatingfried sausage patties with Snippyfig Sauce.The Hufflepuff boy’s hands were trembling, but he cut the food, andate it, without dropping it.“Hello, General,” Neville said, his voice wavering only slightly. “Didyou fight a duel with Bellatrix Black last night?”“No,” Harry said. His own voice was also wavery, for some reason.“Didn’t think so,” said Neville. There was a scraping sound as his knifecut the sausage again. “I’m going to hunt her down and kill her, can Icount on you to help?”There were startled gasps from the mass of Hufflepuffs who had gathered around Neville.“If she comes after you,” Harry said hoarsely, if it was all a terrible mistake, if it was all a lie, “I’ll defend you even with my life,” won’t let you get hurtfor what I did, no matter what, “but I won’t help you go after her, Neville,friends don’t help friends commit suicide.”Neville’s fork paused on the way to his mouth.Then Neville put the bite of food in his mouth, chewed again.And Neville swallowed it.And Neville said, “I didn’t mean right now, I mean after I graduate Hogwarts.”“Neville,” Harry said, keeping his voice under very careful control, “Ithink, even after you graduate, that might still be a just plain stupid idea.There’s got to be much more experienced Aurors tracking her—” oh, wait,that’s not good—“Listen to him!” said Ernie Macmillan, and then an older-looking Hufflepuff girl standing close to Neville said, “Nevvy, please, think about it,he’s right!”Neville stood up.Neville said, “Please don’t follow me.”
974 *




Neville walked away from all of them; Harry and Ernie reaching outinvoluntarily toward him, and some of the other Hufflepuffs as well.And Neville sat down at the Gryffindor table, and distantly (thoughthey had to strain to hear) they heard Neville say, “I’m going to hunt herdown and kill her after I graduate, anyone want to help?” and at leastfive voices said “Yes” and then Ron Weasley said loudly, “Get in line, youlot, I got an owl from Mum this morning, she says to tell everyone she’scalled dibs” and someone said “Molly Weasley against Bellatrix Black? Whodoes she even think she’s kidding—” and Ron reached over to a plate andhefted a muffin—Someone tapped Harry on the shoulder, and he turned around andsaw an unfamiliar green-trimmed older girl, who handed him a parchment envelope and then quickly strode away.Harry stared at the envelope for a moment, then started walking toward the nearest wall. That wasn’t very private, but it should be privateenough, and Harry didn’t want to give the impression of having much tohide.That had been a Slytherin System delivery, what you used if youwanted to communicate with someone without anyone else knowingthat the two of you had talked. The sender gave an envelope to someonewho had a reputation for being a reliable messenger, along with tenKnuts; that first person would take five Knuts and pass the envelopeto another messenger along with the other five Knuts, and the secondmessenger would open up that envelope and find another envelope witha name written on it and deliver that envelope to that person. That wayneither of the two people passing the message knew both the sender andthe recipient, so no one else knew that those two parties had been incontact…When Harry reached the wall, he put the envelope inside his robes,opened it beneath the folds of cloth, and carefully snuck a peek at theparchment he drew forth.It said,Classroom to the left of Transfiguration, 8 in the morning.
975 *




Harry stared at it, trying to remember if he knew anyone with theinitials LL.His mind searched…Searched…Retrieved—“The Quibbler girl?” Harry whispered incredulously, and then shut hismouth. She was only ten years old, she shouldn’t be in Hogwarts at all!
Aftermath: Lesath Lestrange.Harry was standing in the unused classroom next to Transfigurationat 8am, waiting, he’d at least managed to get some food into himself before facing the next disaster, Luna Lovegood…The door to the classroom opened, and Harry saw, and gave himselfa really hard mental kick.One more thing he hadn’t thought of, one more thing he really shouldhave.The older boy’s green-trimmed formal robes were askew, there werered spots on them looking very much like small dots of fresh blood, andone corner of his mouth had the look of a place that had been cut andhealed, by Episkey or some other minor medical Charm that didn’t quiteerase all the damage.Lesath Lestrange’s face was streaked with tears, fresh tears and halfdried tears, and there was water in his eyes, a promise of still more on theway. “Quietus,” said the older boy, and then “Homenum Revelio” and someother things, while Harry thought frantically and without much luck.And then Lesath lowered his wand and sheathed it in his robes, andslowly this time, formally, the older boy dropped to his knees on the dustyclassroom floor.Bowed his head all the way down, until his forehead also touched thedust, and Harry would have spoken but he was voiceless.
976 *




Lesath Lestrange said, in a breaking voice, “My life is yours, my Lord,and my death as well.”“I,” Harry said, there was a huge lump in his throat and he was havingtrouble speaking, “I—” didn’t have anything to do with it, he should havebeen saying, should be saying right now, but then again the innocentHarry would have had trouble speaking too—“Thank you,” whispered Lesath, “thank you, my Lord, oh, thank you,”the sound of a choked-off sob came from the kneeling boy, all Harry couldsee of him was the hair on the back of his head, nothing of his face. “I’ma fool, my Lord, an ungrateful bastard, unworthy to serve you, I cannotabase myself enough, for I—I shouted at you after you helped me, becauseI thought you were refusing me, and I didn’t even realize until this morning that I’d been such a fool as to ask you in front of Longbottom—”“I didn’t have anything to do with it,” Harry said.(It was still very hard to tell an outright lie like that.)Slowly Lesath raised his head from the floor, looked up at Harry.“I understand, my Lord,” said the older boy, his voice wavering a little,“you do not trust my cunning, and indeed I have shown myself a fool… Ionly wanted to say to you, that I am not ungrateful, that I know it musthave been hard enough to save only one person, that they’re alerted now,that you can’t—get Father—but I am not ungrateful, I will never be ungrateful to you again. If ever you have a use for this unworthy servant,call me wherever I am, and I will answer, my Lord—”“I was not involved in any way.”(But it got easier each time.)Lesath gazed up at Harry, said uncertainly, “Am I dismissed fromyour presence, my Lord…?”“I am not your Lord.”Lesath said, “Yes, my Lord, I understand,” and pushed himself backup from the floor, stood straight and bowed deeply, then backed awayfrom Harry until he turned to open the classroom door.As Lesath’s hand touched the doorknob, he paused.Harry couldn’t see Lesath’s face, as the older boy’s voice said, “Did yousend her to someone who would take care of her? Did she ask about meat all?”
977 *




And Harry said, his voice perfectly level, “Please stop that. I was notinvolved in any way.”“Yes, my Lord, I’m sorry, my Lord,” said Lesath’s voice; and theSlytherin boy opened the door and went out and shut the door behindhim. His feet sped up as he ran away, but not fast enough that Harrycouldn’t hear him start sobbing.Would I cry? wondered Harry. If I knew nothing, if I was innocent, wouldI cry right now?Harry didn’t know, so he just kept looking at the door.And some unbelievably tactless part of him thought, Yay, we completeda quest and got a minion—Shut up. If you ever want to vote on anything ever again… shut up.
Aftermath, Amelia Bones:“Then his life isn’t in danger, I take it,” said Amelia.The healer, a stern-eyed old man who wore his robes white (he was aMuggleborn and honoring some strange tradition of Muggles, of whichAmelia had never asked, although privately she thought it made him looktoo much like a ghost), shook his head and said, “Definitely not.”Amelia looked at the human form resting unconscious on the healer’sbed, the burned and blasted flesh, the thin sheet that covered him formodesty’s sake having been peeled back at her command.He might make a full recovery.He might not.The healer had said it was too early to say.Then Amelia looked at the other witch in the room, the detective.“And you say,” Amelia said, “that the burning matter was Transfigured from water, presumably in the form of ice.”The detective nodded her head, and said, sounding puzzled, “It couldhave been much worse, if not for—”
978 *




“How very nice of them,” she spat, and then pressed a weary hand toher forehead. No… no, it had been intended as a kindness. By the finalstage of the escape there would be no point in trying to fool anyone. Whoever had done this, then, had been trying to mitigate the damage—andthey’d been thinking in terms of Aurors breathing the smoke, not of anyone being attacked with the fire. If it had been them still in control, nodoubt, they would have steered the rocker more mercifully.But Bellatrix Black had ridden the rocker out of Azkaban alone,all the watching Aurors had agreed on that, they’d had their AntiDisillusionment Charms active and there had been only one womanon that rocker, though the rocker had sported two sets of stirrups.Some good and innocent person, capable of casting the PatronusCharm, had been tricked into rescuing Bellatrix Black.Some innocent had fought Bahry One-Hand, carefully subduing anexperienced Auror without significantly injuring him.Some innocent had Transfigured the fuel for the Muggle artifact onwhich the two of them had been to ride out of Azkaban, making it fromfrozen water for the benefit of her Aurors.And then their usefulness to Bellatrix Black had ended.You would have expected anyone capable of subduing Bahry OneHand to have foreseen that part. But then you wouldn’t have expectedanyone who could cast the Patronus Charm to try rescuing BellatrixBlack in the first place.Amelia passed her hand down over her eyes, closing them for a moment in silent mourning. I wonder who it was, and how You-Know-Who manipulated them… what story they could possibly have been told…She didn’t even realize until a moment later that the thought meantshe was starting to believe. Perhaps because, no matter how difficult itwas to believe Dumbledore, it was becoming more difficult not to recognize the hand of that cold, dark intelligence.

Aftermath, Albus Dumbledore:It might have been only fifty-seven seconds before breakfast endedand he might have needed four twists of his Time-Turner, but in the end,Albus Dumbledore did make it.“Headmaster?” squeaked the polite voice of Professor Filius Flitwick,as the old wizard passed him by on his way to his seat. “Mr. Potter left amessage for you.”The old wizard stopped. He looked inquiringly at the Charms Professor.“Mr. Potter said that after he woke up, he realized how unfair hadbeen the things he said to you after Fawkes screamed. Mr. Potter saidthat he wasn’t saying anything about anything else, just apologizing forthat one part.”The old wizard kept looking at his Charms Professor, and still did notspeak.“Headmaster?” squeaked Filius.“Tell him I said thank you,” said Albus Dumbledore, “but that it iswiser to listen to phoenixes than to wise old wizards,” and sat down athis place three seconds before all the food vanished.

Aftermath, Professor Quirrell:“No,” Madam Pomfrey snapped at the child, “you may not see him!You may not pester him! You may not ask him one little question! He is torest in bed and do nothing for at least three days!”





Aftermath, Minerva McGonagall:She was heading toward the infirmary, and Harry Potter was leavingit, when they passed each other.The look he gave her wasn’t angry.It wasn’t sad.It didn’t say much at all.It was like… like he was looking at her just long enough to make it clearthat he wasn’t deliberately avoiding looking at her.And then he looked away before she could figure out what look to givehim in return; as though he wanted to spare her that, as well.He didn’t say anything as he walked past her.Neither did she.What could there possibly be to say?
Aftermath, Fred and George Weasley:They actually yelped out loud, when they turned the corner and sawDumbledore.It wasn’t that the Headmaster had popped up out of nowhere and wasstaring at them with a stern expression. Dumbledore was always doingthat.But the wizard was dressed in formal black robes and looking veryancient and very powerful and he was giving the two of them a SHARP“Fred and George Weasley!” spake Dumbledore in a Voice of Power.“Yes, Headmaster!” they said, snapping upright and giving him acrisp military salute they’d seen in some old pictures.“Hear me well! You are the friends of Harry Potter, is this so?”“Yes, Headmaster!”“Harry Potter is in danger. He must not go beyond the wards of Hogwarts. Listen to me, sons of Weasley, I beg you listen: you know that I amas Gryffindor as yourselves, that I too know there are higher rules than
981 *




rules. But this, Fred and George, this one thing is of the most terrible importance, there must be no exception this time, small or great! If you helpHarry to leave Hogwarts he may die! Does he send you on a mission, youmay go, does he ask you to bring him items, you may help, but if he asksyou to smuggle his own person out of Hogwarts, you must refuse! Do youunderstand?”“Yes, Headmaster!” They said it without even thinking, really, andthen exchanged uncertain looks with each other—The bright blue eyes of the Headmaster were intent upon them. “No.Not without thinking. If Harry asks you to bring him out, you mustrefuse, if he asks you to tell him the way, you must refuse. I will not askyou to report him to me, for that I know you would never do. But beghim on my behalf to go to me, if it is of such importance, and I will guardhim as he walks. Fred, George, I am sorry to strain your friendship so,but it is his life.”The two of them looked at each other for a long while, not communicating, only thinking the same things at the same time.They looked back at Dumbledore.They said, with a chill running through them as they spoke the name,“Bellatrix Black.”“You may safely assume,” said the Headmaster, “that it is at least thatbad.”“Okay—”“—got it.”

Aftermath, Alastor Moody and Severus Snape:When Alastor Moody had lost his eye, he had commandeered the services of a most erudite Ravenclaw, Samuel H. Lyall, whom Moody mistrusted slightly less than average because Moody had refrained from reporting him as an unregistered werewolf; and he had paid Lyall to compile a list of every known magical eye, and every known hint to their location.When Moody had gotten the list back, he hadn’t bothered readingmost of it; because at the top of the list was the Eye of Vance, dating backto an era before Hogwarts, and currently in the possession of a powerful Dark Wizard ruling over some tiny forgotten hellhole that wasn’t inBritain or anywhere else he’d have to worry about silly rules.That was how Alastor Moody had lost his left foot and acquired theEye of Vance, and how the oppressed souls of Urulat had been liberatedfor a period of around two weeks before another Dark Wizard moved inon the power vacuum.He’d considered going after the Left Foot of Vance next, but had decided against it after he realized that would be just what they were expecting.Now Mad-Eye Moody was turning slowly, always turning, surveyingthe graveyard of Little Hangleton. It should have been a lot gloomier,that place, but in the broad daylight it seemed like nothing but a grassyplace marked by ordinary tombstones, demarcated by the chained twistsof fragile, easily climbable metal that Muggles used instead of wards.(Moody could not comprehend what the Muggles were thinking on thatscore, if they were pretending to have wards, or what, and he had decidednot to ask whether Muggle criminals respected the pretense.)Moody didn’t actually need to turn to survey the graveyard.The Eye of Vance saw the full globe of the world in every directionaround him, no matter where it was pointing.But there was no particular reason to let a former Death Eater likeSeverus Snape know that.Sometimes people called Moody ‘paranoid’.Moody always told them to survive a hundred years of hunting DarkWizards and then get back to him about that.

Mad-Eye Moody had once worked out how long it had taken him, inretrospect, to achieve what he now considered a decent level of caution—weighed up how much experience it had taken him to get good instead oflucky—and had begun to suspect that most people died before they gotthere. Moody had once expressed this thought to Lyall, who had donesome ciphering and figuring, and told him that a typical Dark Wizardhunter would die, on average, eight and a half times along the way to becoming ‘paranoid’. This explained a great deal, assuming Lyall wasn’t lying.Yesterday, Albus Dumbledore had told Mad-Eye Moody that the DarkLord had used unspeakable dark arts to survive the death of his body, andwas now awake and abroad, seeking to regain his power and begin theWizarding War anew.Someone else might have reacted with incredulity.“I can’t believe you lot never told me about this resurrection thing,”Mad-Eye Moody said with considerable acerbity. “D’you realize how longit’ll take me to do the grave of every ancestor of every Dark Wizard I’veever killed who could’ve been smart enough to make a horcrux? You’renot just now doing this one, are you?”“I redose this one every year,” Severus Snape said calmly, uncappingthe third flask of what the man had claimed would be seventeen bottles,and beginning to wave his wand over it. “The other ancestral graves we’vebeen able to locate were poisoned with only the long-lasting substances,since some of us have less free time than yourself.”Moody watched the fluid spiraling out of the vial and vanishing, toappear within the bones where marrow had once been. “But you thinkit’s worth the effort of the trap, instead of just Vanishing the bones.”“He does have other avenues to life, should he perceive this oneblocked,” Snape said dryly, uncapping a fourth bottle. “And before youask, it must be the original grave, the place of first burial, the bone removed during the ritual and not before. Thus he cannot have retrieved itearlier; and also there is no point in substituting the skeleton of a weakerancestor. He would notice it had lost all potency.”“Who else knows about this trap?” Moody demanded.“You. Me. The Headmaster. No one else.”

Moody snorted. “Pfah. Did Albus tell Amelia, Bartemius, and thatMcGonagall woman about the resurrection ritual?”“Yes—”“If Voldie finds out that Albus knows about the resurrection ritual andthat Albus told them, Voldie’ll figure that Albus told me, and Voldie knowsI’d think of this.” Moody shook his head in disgust. “What’re these otherways Voldie could come back to life?”Snape’s hand paused on the fifth bottle (it was all Disillusioned, ofcourse, the whole operation was Disillusioned, but that meant less thannothing to Moody, it just marked you in his Eye’s sight as trying-to-hide),and the former Death Eater said, “You don’t need to know.”“You’re learning, son,” said Moody with mild approval. “What’s in thebottles?”Snape opened the fifth bottle, gestured with his wand to begin thesubstance flowing toward the grave, and said, “This one? A Muggle narcotic called LSD. A conversation yesterday put me in mind of Mugglethings, and LSD seemed the most interesting option, so I hurried to obtain some. If it is incorporated into the resurrection potion, I suspect itseffects will be permanent.”“What does it do?” said Moody.“It is said that the effects are impossible to describe to anyone whohas not used it,” drawled Snape, “and I have not used it.”Moody nodded approval as Snape opened the sixth flask. “What aboutthat one?”“Love potion.”“Love potion?” said Moody.“Not of the standard sort. It is meant to trigger a two-way bond withan unbearably sweet Veela woman named Verdandi who the Headmasterhopes might be able to redeem even him, if they truly loved each other.”“Gah!” said Moody. “That bloody sentimental fool—”“Agreed,” Severus Snape said calmly, his attention focused on hiswork.“Tell me you’ve at least got some Malaclaw venom in there.”“Second flask.”“Iocane powder.”
985 *




“Either the fourteenth or fifteenth bottle.”“Bahl’s Stupefaction,” Moody said, naming an extremely addictivenarcotic with interesting side effects on people with Slytherin tendencies; Moody had once seen an addicted Dark Wizard go to ridiculouslengths to get a victim to lay hands on a certain exact portkey, instead ofjust having someone toss the target a trapped Knut on their next visit totown; and after going to all that work, the addict had gone to the furthereffort to lay a second Portus, on the same portkey, which had, on a secondtouch, transported the victim back to safety. To this day, even taking thedrug into account, Moody could not imagine what could have possiblybeen going through the man’s mind at the time he had cast the secondPortus.“Tenth vial,” said Snape.“Basilisk venom,” offered Moody.“What?” spat Snape. “Snake venom is a positive component of theresurrection potion! Not to mention that it would dissolve the bone andall the other substances! And where would we even get—”“Calm down, son, I was just checking to see if you could be trusted.”Mad-Eye Moody continued his (secretly unnecessary) slow turning,surveying the graveyard, and the Potions Master continued pouring.“Hold on,” Moody said suddenly. “How do you know this is reallywhere—”“Because it says ‘Tom Riddle’ on the easily moved headstone,” Snapesaid dryly. “And I have just won ten Sickles from the Headmaster, whobet you would think of that before the fifth bottle. So much for constantvigilance.”There was a pause.“How long did it take Albus to reali—”“Three years after we learned of the ritual,” said Snape, in a tone notquite like his usual sardonic drawl. “In retrospect, we should have consulted you earlier.”Snape uncapped the ninth bottle.“We poisoned all the other graves as well, with long-lasting substances,” remarked the former Death Eater. “It is possible that we arein the correct graveyard. He may not have planned this far ahead back

when he was slaughtering his family, and he cannot move the graveitself—”“The true location doesn’t look like a graveyard any more,” Moodysaid flatly. “He moved all the other graves here and Memory-Charmedthe Muggles. Not even Bellatrix Black would be told anything about thatuntil just before the ritual started. No one knows the true location nowexcept him.”They continued their futile work.
Aftermath, Blaise Zabini:The Slytherin common room could be accurately and precisely described as a remilitarized zone; the moment you stepped through theportrait hole you would see that the left half of the room was DefinitelyNot Talking to the right half and vice versa. It was very clear, it did notneed to be explained to anyone, that you did not have the option of nottaking sides.At a table in the exact middle of the room, Blaise Zabini sat by himself,smirking as he did his homework. He had a reputation now, and meantto keep it.
Aftermath, Daphne Greengrass and Tracey Davis:“You doing anything interesting today?” said Tracey.“Nope,” said Daphne.

Aftermath, Harry Potter:If you went high enough in Hogwarts, you didn’t see many otherpeople around, just corridors and windows and staircases and the occasional portrait, and now and then some interesting sight, such as abronze statue of a furry creature like a small child, holding a peculiar flatspear…If you went high enough in Hogwarts, you didn’t see many other people around, which suited Harry.There were much worse places to be trapped, Harry supposed. Infact you probably couldn’t think of anywhere better to be trapped thanan ancient castle with a fractal ever-changing structure that meant youcouldn’t ever run out of places to explore, full of interesting people andinteresting books and incredibly important knowledge unknown to Muggle science.If Harry hadn’t been told that he couldn’t leave, he probably would’vejumped at the chance to spend more time in Hogwarts, he would’ve plotted and connived to get it. Hogwarts was literally optimal, not in all therealms of possibility maybe, but certainly on the real planet Earth, it wasthe Maximum Fun Location.How could the castle and its grounds seem so much smaller, so muchmore confining, how could the rest of the world become so much moreinteresting and important, the instant Harry had been told that he wasn’tallowed to leave? He’d spent months here and hadn’t felt claustrophobicthen.You know the research on this, observed some part of himself, it’s juststandard scarcity effects, like that time where as soon as a county outlawed phosphate detergents, people who’d never cared before drove to the next county in order to buy huge loads of phosphate detergent, and surveys showed that they ratedphosphate detergents as gentler and more effective and even easier-pouring… andif you give two-year-olds a choice between a toy in the open and one protected bya barrier they can go around, they’ll ignore the toy in the open and go for the onebehind the barrier… salespeople know that they can sell things just by telling thecustomer it might not be available… it was all in Cialdini’s book Influence, ev* 988 *




erything you’re feeling right now, the grass is always greener on the side that’s notallowed.If Harry hadn’t been told that he couldn’t leave, he probably would’vejumped at the chance to stay at Hogwarts over the summer……but not the rest of his life.That was sort of the problem, really.Who knew whether there was still a Dark Lord Voldemort for him todefeat?Who knew whether He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named still existed outside of the imagination of a possibly-not-just-pretending-to-be-crazy oldwizard?Lord Voldemort’s body had been found burned to a crisp, therecouldn’t really be such things as souls. How could Lord Voldemort stillbe alive? How did Dumbledore know that he was alive?And if there wasn’t a Dark Lord, Harry couldn’t defeat him, and hewould be trapped in Hogwarts forever.…maybe he would be legally allowed to escape after he graduated hisseventh year, six years and four months and three weeks from now. Itwasn’t that long as lengths of time went, it only seemed like long enoughfor protons to decay.Only it wasn’t just that.It wasn’t just Harry’s freedom that was at stake.The Headmaster of Hogwarts, the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot,the Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards,was quietly sounding the alarm.A false alarm.A false alarm which Harry had triggered.You know, said the part of him that refined his skills, didn’t you sort ofponder, once, how every different profession has a different way to be excellent,how an excellent teacher isn’t like an excellent plumber; but they all have in common certain methods of not being stupid; and that one of the most important suchtechniques is to face up to your little mistakes before they turn into BIG mistakes?…although this already seemed to qualify as a BIG mistake, actually…The point being, said his inner monitor, it’s getting worse literally by theminute. The way spies turn people is, they get them to commit a little sin, and then




they use the little sin to blackmail them into a bigger sin, and then they use THATsin to make them do even bigger things and then the blackmailer owns their soul.Didn’t you once think about how the person being blackmailed, if they couldforesee the whole path, would just decide to take the punch on the first step, take thehit of exposing that first sin? Didn’t you decide that you would do that, if anyoneever tried to blackmail you into doing something major in order to conceal something little? Do you see the similarity here, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres?Only it wasn’t little, it already wasn’t little, there would be a lot of verypowerful people extremely angry at Harry, not just for the false alarm butfor freeing Bellatrix from Azkaban, if the Dark Lord did exist and did comeafter him later, that war might already be lost—You don’t think they’ll be impressed by your honesty and rationality and foresight in stopping this before it snowballs even further?Harry did not, in fact, think this; and after a moment’s reflection,whichever part of himself he was talking to, had to agree that this wasabsurdly optimistic.His wandering feet took him near an open window, and Harry wentover, and leaned his arms on the ledge, and stared down at the groundsof Hogwarts from high above.Brown that was barren trees, yellow that was dead grass, ice-coloredice that was frozen creeks and frozen streams… whichever school officialhad dubbed it ‘The Forbidden Forest’ really hadn’t understood marketing,the name just made you want to go there even more. The sun was sinkingin the sky, for Harry had been thinking for some hours now, thinkingmostly the same thoughts over and over, but with key differences eachtime, like his thoughts were not going in circles, but climbing a spiral, ordescending it.He still couldn’t believe that he’d gone through the entire thing withAzkaban—he’d switched off his Patronus before it took all his life, he’dstunned an Auror, he’d figured out how to hide Bella from the Dementors,he’d faced down twelve Dementors and scared them away, he’d inventedthe rocket-assisted broomstick, and ridden it—he’d gone through the entire thing without ever once rallying himself by thinking, I have to do this…because… I promised Hermione I’d come back from lunch! It felt like an irrevocably missed opportunity; like, having done it wrong that time, he would




never be able to get it right no matter what sort of challenge he faced nexttime, or what promise he made. Because then he would just be doingit awkwardly and deliberately to make up for having missed it the firsttime around, instead of making the heroic declarations he could’ve madeif he’d remembered his promise to Hermione. Like that one wrong turnwas irrevocable, you only got one chance, had to do it right on the firsttry…He should’ve remembered that promise to Hermione before going toAzkaban.Why had he decided to do that, again?My working hypothesis is that you’re stupid, said Hufflepuff.That is not a useful fault analysis, thought Harry.If you want a little more detail, said Hufflepuff, the Defense Professor ofHogwarts was all like ‘Let’s get Bellatrix Black out of Azkaban!’ and you were like‘Okay!’Hold on, THAT’S not fair—Hey, said Hufflepuff, notice how, once you’re all the way up here, and theindividual trees sort of blur together, you can actually see the shape of the forest?Why had he done it…?Not because of any cost-benefit calculation, that was for sure. He’dbeen too embarrassed to pull out a sheet of paper and start calculating expected utilities, he’d worried that Professor Quirrell would stop respecting him if he said no or even hesitated too much to help a maiden in distress.He’d thought, somewhere deep inside him, that if your mysteriousteacher offered you the first mission, the first chance, the call to adventure, and you said no, then your mysterious teacher walked away fromyou in disgust, and you never got another chance to be a hero……yeah, that had been it. In retrospect, that had been it. He’d gone andstarted thinking his life had a plot and here was a plot twist, as opposedto, oh, say, here was a proposal to break Bellatrix Black out of Azkaban. Thathad been the true and original reason for the decision in the split second where it had been made, his brain perceptually recognizing the narrative where he said ‘no’ as dissonant. And when you thought about it,that wasn’t a rational way to make decisions. Professor Quirrell’s ulterior

motive to obtain the last remains of Slytherin’s lost lore, before Bellatrixdied and it was irrevocably forgotten, seemed impressively sane by comparison; a benefit commensurate with what had appeared at the time asa small risk.It didn’t seem fair, it didn’t seem fair, that this was what happened ifhe lost his grip on his rationality for just a tiny fraction of a second, thetiny fraction of a second required for his brain to decide to be more comfortable with ‘yes’ arguments than ‘no’ arguments during the discussionthat had followed.From high above, far enough above that the individual trees blurredtogether, Harry stared out at the forest.Harry didn’t want to confess and ruin his reputation forever and geteveryone angry at him and maybe end up killed by the Dark Lord later.He’d rather be trapped in Hogwarts for six years than face that. That washow he felt. And so it was in fact helpful, a relief, to be able to cling to a single decisive factor, which was that if Harry confessed, Professor Quirrellwould go to Azkaban and die there.(A catch, a break, a stutter in Harry’s breathing.)If you phrased it that way… why, you could even pretend to be a hero,instead of a coward.Harry lifted his eyes from the Forbidden Forest, looked up at the clearblue forbidden sky.Stared out the glass panes at the big bright burning thing, the fluffythings, the mysterious endless blue in which they were embedded, thatstrange new unknown place.It… actually did help, it helped quite a lot, to think that his own troubles were nothing compared to being in Azkaban. That there were peoplein the world who were really in trouble and Harry Potter was not one ofthem.What was he going to do about Azkaban?What was he going to do about magical Britain?…which side was he on, now?In the bright light of day, everything that Albus Dumbledore had saidcertainly sounded a lot wiser than Professor Quirrell. Better and brighter,more moral, more convenient, wouldn’t it be nice if it were true. And the
992 *




thing to remember was that Dumbledore believed things because theysounded nice, but Professor Quirrell was the one who was sane.(Again the catch in his breathing, it happened each time he thoughtof Professor Quirrell.)But just because something sounded nice, didn’t make it wrong, either.And if the Defense Professor did have a flaw in his sanity, it was thathis outlook on life was too negative.Really? inquired the part of Harry that had read eighteen million experimental results about people being too optimistic and overconfident.Professor Quirrell is too pessimistic? So pessimistic that his expectations routinelyundershoot reality? Stuff him and put him in a museum, he’s unique. Whichone of you two planned the perfect crime, and then put in all the error marginand fallbacks that ended up saving your butt, just in case the perfect crime wentwrong? Hint hint, his name wasn’t Harry Potter.But “pessimistic” wasn’t the correct word to describe Professor Quirrell’s problem—if a problem it truly was, and not the superior wisdom ofexperience. But to Harry it looked like Professor Quirrell was constantlyinterpreting everything in the worst possible light. If you handed Professor Quirrell a glass that was 90% full, he’d tell you that the 10% empty partproved that no one really cared about water.That was a very good analogy, now that Harry thought about it. Notall of magical Britain was like Azkaban, that glass was well over half full…Harry stared up at the bright blue sky.…although, following the analogy, if Azkaban existed, then maybe itdid prove that the 90% good part was there for other reasons, people trying to make a show of kindness as Professor Quirrell had put it. For if theywere truly kind they would not have made Azkaban, they would storm thefortress to tear it down… wouldn’t they?Harry stared up at the bright blue sky. If you wanted to be a rationalist you had to read an awful lot of papers on flaws in human nature,and some of those flaws were innocent logical failures, and some of themlooked a lot darker.Harry stared up at the bright blue sky, and thought of the Milgramexperiment.
993 *




Stanley Milgram had done it to investigate the causes of World WarII, to try to understand why the citizens of Germany had obeyed Hitler.So he had designed an experiment to investigate obedience, to see ifGermans were, for some reason, more liable to obey harmful orders fromauthority figures.First he’d run a pilot version of his experiment on American subjects,as a control.And afterward he hadn’t bothered trying it in Germany.Experimental apparatus: A series of 30 switches set in a horizontalline, with labels starting at ‘15 volts’ and going up to ‘450 volts’, with labelsfor each group of four switches. The first group of four labeled ‘SlightShock’, the sixth group labeled ‘Extreme Intensity Shock’, the seventhgroup labeled ‘Danger: Severe Shock’, and the two last switches left overlabeled just ‘XXX’.And an actor, a confederate of the experimenter, who had appearedto the true subjects to be someone just like them: someone who had answered the same ad for participants in an experiment on learning, andwho had lost a (rigged) lottery and been strapped into a chair, along withthe electrodes. The true experimental subjects had been given a slightshock from the electrodes, just so that they could see that it worked.The true subject had been told that the experiment was on the effectsof punishment on learning and memory, and that part of the test was tosee if it made a difference what sort of person administered the punishment; and that the person strapped to the chair would try to memorizesets of word pairs, and that each time the ‘learner’ got one wrong, the‘teacher’ was to administer a successively stronger shock.At the 300-volt level, the actor would stop trying to call out answersand begin kicking at the wall, after which the experimenter would instruct the subjects to treat non-answers as wrong answers and continue.At the 315-volt level the pounding on the wall would be repeated.After that nothing would be heard.If the subject objected or refused to press a switch, the experimenter,maintaining an impassive demeanor and dressed in a gray lab coat,would say ‘Please continue’, then ‘The experiment requires that you continue’, then ‘It is absolutely essential that you continue’, then ‘You have

no other choice, you must go on’. If the fourth prod still didn’t work, theexperiment halted there.Before running the experiment, Milgram had described the experimental setup, and then asked fourteen psychology seniors whatpercentage of subjects they thought would go all the way up to the 450volt level, what percentage of subjects would press the last of the twoswitches marked XXX, after the victim had stopped responding.The most pessimistic answer had been 3%.The actual number had been 26 out of 40.The subjects had sweated, groaned, stuttered, laughed nervously,bitten their lips, dug their fingernails into their flesh. But at the experimenter’s prompting, they had, most of them, gone on administeringwhat they believed to be painful, dangerous, possibly lethal electricalshocks. All the way to the end.Harry could hear Professor Quirrell laughing, in his mind; the Defense Professor’s voice saying something along the lines of: Why, Mr. Potter, even I had not been so cynical; I knew men would betray their most cherishedprinciples for money and power, but I did not realize that a stern look also sufficed.It was dangerous, to try and guess at evolutionary psychology if youweren’t a professional evolutionary psychologist; but when Harry hadread about the Milgram experiment, the thought had occurred to himthat situations like this had probably arisen many times in the ancestralenvironment, and that most potential ancestors who’d tried to disobeyAuthority were dead. Or that they had, at least, done less well for themselves than the obedient. People thought themselves good and moral,but when push came to shove, some switch flipped in their brain, and itwas suddenly a lot harder to heroically defy Authority than they thought.Even if you could do it, it wouldn’t be easy, it wouldn’t be some effortlessdisplay of heroism. You would tremble, your voice would break, youwould be afraid; would you be able to defy Authority even then?Harry blinked, then; because his brain had just made the connectionbetween Milgram’s experiment and what Hermione had done on her firstday of Defense class, she’d refused to shoot a fellow student, even whenAuthority had told her that she must, she had trembled and been afraid

but she had still refused. Harry had seen that happen right in front of hisown eyes and he still hadn’t made the connection until now…Harry stared down at the reddening horizon, the Sun was sinkinglower, the sky fading, darkening, even if most of it was still blue, soon itwould turn to night. The gold and red colors of Sun and sunset remindedhim of Fawkes; and Harry wondered, for a moment, if it must be a sadthing to be a phoenix, and call and cry and scream without being heeded.But Fawkes would never give up, as many times as he died he wouldalways be reborn, for Fawkes was a being of light and fire, and despairingover Azkaban belonged to the darkness just as much as did Azkaban itself.If you were given a glass half-empty and half-full, then that was theway reality was, that was the truth and it was so; but you still had a choiceof how to feel about it, whether you would despair over the empty half orrejoice in the water that was there.Milgram had tried certain other variations on his test.In the eighteenth experiment, the experimental subject had onlyneeded to call out the test words to the victim strapped into the chair,and record the answers, while someone else pressed the switches. It wasthe same apparent suffering, the same frantic pounding followed bysilence; but it wasn’t you pressing the switch. You just watched it happen,and read the questions to the person being tortured.37 of 40 subjects had continued their participation in that experimentto the end, the 450-volt end marked ‘XXX’.And if you were Professor Quirrell, you might have decided to feel cynical about that.But 3 out of 40 subjects had refused to participate all the way to the end.The Hermiones.They did exist, in the world, the people who wouldn’t fire a SimpleStrike Hex at a fellow student even if the Defense Professor ordered themto do it. The ones who had sheltered Gypsies and Jews and homosexualsin their attics during the Holocaust, and sometimes lost their lives for it.And were those people from some other species than humanity? Didthey have some extra gear in their heads, some additional chunk of neural circuitry, which lesser mortals did not possess? But that was not likely,given the logic of sexual reproduction which said that the genes for com*

plex machinery would be scrambled beyond repair, if they were not universal.Whatever parts Hermione was made from, everyone had those same
