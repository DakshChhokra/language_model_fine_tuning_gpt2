Every inch of wall space is covered by a bookcase. Each bookcase has six shelves, going almost to the ceiling. Some bookshelves are stackedto the brim with hardback books: science, maths, history, and everythingelse. Other shelves have two layers of paperback science fiction, with theback layer of books propped up on old tissue boxes or lengths of wood,so that you can see the back layer of books above the books in front. Andit still isn’t enough. Books are overflowing onto the tables and the sofasand making little heaps under the windows.This is the living-room of the house occupied by the eminent Professor Michael Verres-Evans, and his wife, Mrs. Petunia Evans-Verres, and their adopted son, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres.There is a letter lying on the living-room table, and an unstampedenvelope of yellowish parchment, addressed to Mr. H. Potter in emeraldgreen ink.The Professor and his wife are speaking sharply at each other, but theyare not shouting. The Professor considers shouting to be uncivilised.“You’re joking,” Michael said to Petunia. His tone indicated that hewas very much afraid that she was serious.“My sister was a witch,” Petunia repeated. She looked frightened, butstood her ground. “Her husband was a wizard.”“This is absurd!” Michael said sharply. “They were at our wedding—they visited for Christmas—”“I told them you weren’t to know,” Petunia whispered. “But it’s true.I’ve seen things—”The Professor rolled his eyes. “Dear, I understand that you’re not familiar with the sceptical literature. You may not realise how easy it is fora trained magician to fake the seemingly impossible. Remember how Itaught Harry to bend spoons? If it seemed like they could always guesswhat you were thinking, that’s called cold reading—”“It wasn’t bending spoons—”“What was it, then?”Petunia bit her lip. “I can’t just tell you. You’ll think I’m—” She swallowed. “Listen. Michael. I wasn’t—always like this—” She gestured atherself, as though to indicate her lithe form. “Lily did this. Because I—because I begged her. For years, I begged her. Lily had always been prettier than me, and I’d… been mean to her, because of that, and then shegot magic, can you imagine how I felt? And I begged her to use some ofthat magic on me so that I could be pretty too, even if I couldn’t have hermagic, at least I could be pretty.”Tears were gathering in Petunia’s eyes.“And Lily would tell me no, and make up the most ridiculous excuses,like the world would end if she were nice to her sister, or a centaur toldher not to—the most ridiculous things, and I hated her for it. And when Ihad just graduated from university, I was going out with this boy, VernonDursley, he was fat and he was the only boy who would talk to me. And hesaid he wanted children, and that his first son would be named Dudley.And I thought to myself, what kind of parent names their child Dudley Dursley?It was like I saw my whole future life stretching out in front of me, and Icouldn’t stand it. And I wrote to my sister and told her that if she didn’thelp me I’d rather just—”Petunia stopped.“Anyway,” Petunia said, her voice small, “she gave in. She told me itwas dangerous, and I said I didn’t care any more, and I drank this potionand I was sick for weeks, but when I got better my skin cleared up and Ifinally filled out and… I was beautiful, people were nice to me,” her voicebroke, “and after that I couldn’t hate my sister any more, especially whenI learned what her magic brought her in the end—”“Darling,” Michael said gently, “you got sick, you gained some weightwhile resting in bed, and your skin cleared up on its own. Or being sickmade you change your diet—”“She was a witch,” Petunia repeated. “I saw it.”“Petunia,” Michael said. The annoyance was creeping into his voice.“You know that can’t be true. Do I really have to explain why?”Petunia wrung her hands. She seemed to be on the verge of tears. “Mylove, I know I can’t win arguments with you, but please, you have to trustme on this—”“Dad! Mum!”The two of them stopped and looked at Harry as though they’d forgotten there was a third person in the room.Harry took a deep breath. “Mum, your parents didn’t have magic, didthey?”“No,” Petunia said, looking puzzled.“Then no one in your family knew about magic when Lily got her letter.How did they get convinced?”“Ah…” Petunia said. “They didn’t just send a letter. They sent a professor from Hogwarts. He—” Petunia’s eyes flicked to Michael. “He showedus some magic.”“Then you don’t have to fight over this,” Harry said firmly. Hopingagainst hope that this time, just this once, they would listen to him. “Ifit’s true, we can just get a Hogwarts professor here and see the magic forourselves, and Dad will admit that it’s true. And if not, then Mum willadmit that it’s false. That’s what the experimental method is for, so thatwe don’t have to resolve things just by arguing.”The Professor turned and looked down at him, dismissive as usual.“Oh, come now, Harry. Really, magic? I thought you’d know better thanto take this seriously, son, even if you’re only ten. Magic is just about themost unscientific thing there is!”Harry’s mouth twisted bitterly. He was treated well, probably betterthan most genetic fathers treated their own children. Harry had beensent to the best primary schools—and when that didn’t work out, he wasprovided with tutors from the endless pool of starving students. AlwaysHarry had been encouraged to study whatever caught his attention,bought all the books that caught his fancy, sponsored in whatever mathsor science competitions he entered. He was given anything reasonablethat he wanted, except, maybe, the slightest shred of respect. A Doctorteaching biochemistry at Oxford could hardly be expected to listen to theadvice of a little boy. You would listen to Show Interest, of course; that’swhat a Good Parent would do, and so, if you conceived of yourself as aGood Parent, you would do it. But take a ten-year-old seriously? Hardly.Sometimes Harry wanted to scream at his father.“Mum,” Harry said. “If you want to win this argument with Dad,look in chapter two of the first book of the Feynman Lectures on Physics.There’s a quote there about how philosophers say a great deal about whatscience absolutely requires, and it is all wrong, because the only rule inscience is that the final arbiter is observation—that you just have to lookat the world and report what you see. Um… off the top of my head I can’tthink of where to find something about how it’s an ideal of science tosettle things by experiment instead of arguments—”His mother looked down at him and smiled. “Thank you, Harry.But—” her head rose back up to stare at her husband. “I don’t want towin an argument with your father. I want my husband to, to listen to hiswife who loves him, and trust her just this once—”Harry closed his eyes briefly. Hopeless. Both of his parents were justhopeless.Now his parents were getting into one of those arguments again, onewhere his mother tried to make his father feel guilty, and his father triedto make his mother feel stupid.“I’m going to go to my room,” Harry announced. His voice trembled alittle. “Please try not to fight too much about this, Mum, Dad, we’ll knowsoon enough how it comes out, right?”“Of course, Harry,” said his father, and his mother gave him a reassuring kiss, and then they went on fighting while Harry climbed the stairs tohis bedroom.He shut the door behind him and tried to think.The funny thing was, he should have agreed with Dad. No one had everseen any evidence of magic, and according to Mum, there was a wholemagical world out there. How could anyone keep something like that asecret? More magic? That seemed like a rather suspicious sort of excuse.It should have been a clean case for Mum joking, lying or being insane,in ascending order of awfulness. If Mum had sent the letter herself, thatwould explain how it arrived at the letterbox without a stamp. A littleinsanity was far, far less improbable than the universe really working likethat.Except that some part of Harry was utterly convinced that magic wasreal, and had been since the instant he saw the putative letter from theHogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.Harry rubbed his forehead, grimacing. Don’t believe everything youthink, one of his books had said.But this bizarre certainty… Harry was finding himself just expectingthat, yes, a Hogwarts professor would show up and wave a wand andmagic would come out. The strange certainty was making no effort toguard itself against falsification—wasn’t making excuses in advance forwhy there wouldn’t be a professor, or the professor would only be able tobend spoons.Where do you come from, strange little prediction? Harry directed thethought at his brain. Why do I believe what I believe?Usually Harry was pretty good at answering that question, but in thisparticular case, he had no clue what his brain was thinking.Harry mentally shrugged. A flat metal plate on a door affords pushing,and a handle on a door affords pulling, and the thing to do with a testablehypothesis is to go and test it.He took a piece of lined paper from his desk, and started writing.Dear Deputy HeadmistressHarry paused, reflecting; then discarded the paper for another, tapping another millimetre of graphite from his mechanical pencil. Thiscalled for careful calligraphy.Dear Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall,Or Whomsoever It May Concern:I recently received your letter of acceptance to Hogwarts, addressed toMr. H. Potter. You may not be aware that my genetic parents, James Potter and Lily Potter (formerly Lily Evans) are dead. I was adopted by Lily’ssister, Petunia Evans-Verres, and her husband, Michael Verres-Evans.I am extremely interested in attending Hogwarts, conditional on sucha place actually existing. Only my mother Petunia says she knows aboutmagic, and she can’t use it herself. My father is highly sceptical. I myself am uncertain. I also don’t know where to obtain any of the books orequipment listed in your acceptance letter.Mother mentioned that you sent a Hogwarts representative to LilyPotter (then Lily Evans) in order to demonstrate to her family that magicwas real, and, I presume, help Lily obtain her school materials. If youcould do this for my own family it would be extremely helpful.Sincerely,Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres.Harry added their current address, then folded up the letter and put itin an envelope, which he addressed to Hogwarts. Further considerationled him to obtain a candle and drip wax onto the flap of the envelope, intowhich, using a penknife’s tip, he impressed the initials H.J.P.E.V. If hewas going to descend into this madness, he was going to do it with style.Then he opened his door and went back downstairs. His father wassitting in the living-room and reading a book of higher maths to showhow smart he was; and his mother was in the kitchen preparing one ofhis father’s favourite meals to show how loving she was. It didn’t looklike they were talking to one another at all. As scary as arguments couldbe, not arguing was somehow much worse.“Mum,” Harry said into the unnerving silence, “I’m going to test thehypothesis. According to your theory, how do I send an owl to Hogwarts?”His mother turned from the kitchen sink to stare at him, lookingshocked. “I—I don’t know, I think you just have to own a magic owl.”That should’ve sounded highly suspicious, oh, so there’s no way to testyour theory then, but the peculiar certainty in Harry seemed willing to stickits neck out even further.“Well, the letter got here somehow,” Harry said, “so I’ll just wave itaround outside and call ‘letter for Hogwarts!’ and see if an owl picks it up.Dad, do you want to come and watch?”His father shook his head minutely and kept on reading. Of course,Harry thought to himself. Magic was a disgraceful thing that only stupidpeople believed in; if his father went so far as to test the hypothesis, oreven watch it being tested, that would feel like associating himself withthat…Only as Harry stumped out the back door, into the back garden, didit occur to him that if an owl did come down and snatch the letter, he wasgoing to have some trouble telling Dad about it.But—well—that can’t really happen, can it? No matter what my brain seemsto believe. If an owl really comes down and grabs this envelope, I’m going to haveworries a lot more important than what Dad thinks.Harry took a deep breath, and raised the envelope into the air.He swallowed.Calling out Letter for Hogwarts! while holding an envelope high in theair in the middle of your own back garden was… actually pretty embarrassing, now that he thought about it.No. I’m better than Dad. I will use the scientific method even if it makes mefeel stupid.“Letter—” Harry said, but it actually came out as more of a whisperedcroak.Harry steeled his will, and shouted into the empty sky, “Letter for Hogwarts! Can I get an owl?”“Harry?” asked a bemused woman’s voice, one of the neighbours.Harry pulled down his hand like it was on fire and hid the envelope behind his back like it was drug money. His whole face was hot with shame.An old woman’s face peered out from above the neighbouring fence,grizzled grey hair escaping from her hairnet. Mrs. Figg, the occasionalbabysitter. “What are you doing, Harry?”“Nothing,” Harry said in a strangled voice. “Just—testing a really sillytheory—”“Did you get your acceptance letter from Hogwarts?”Harry froze in place.“Yes,” Harry’s lips said a little while later. “I got a letter from Hogwarts.They say they want my owl by the 31st of July, but—”“But you don’t have an owl. Poor dear! I can’t imagine what someonemust have been thinking, sending you just the standard letter.”A wrinkled arm stretched out over the fence, and opened an expectanthand. Hardly even thinking at this point, Harry gave over his envelope.“Just leave it to me, dear,” said Mrs. Figg, “and in a jiffy or two I’ll havesomeone over.”And her face disappeared from over the fence.There was a long silence in the garden.Then a boy’s voice said, calmly and quietly, “What.”ow, just to be clear,” Harry said, “if the professor does levitateyou, Dad, when you know you haven’t been attached to any wires,that’s going to be sufficient evidence. You’re not going to turn aroundand say that it’s a magician’s trick. That wouldn’t be fair play. If you feelthat way, you should say so now, and we can figure out a different experiment instead.”Harry’s father, Professor Michael Verres-Evans, rolled his eyes. “Yes,Harry.”“And you, Mum, your theory says that the professor should be able todo this, and if that doesn’t happen, you’ll admit you’re mistaken. Nothingabout how magic doesn’t work when people are sceptical of it, or anythinglike that.”Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall was watching Harry witha bemused expression. She looked quite witchy in her black robes andpointed hat, but when she spoke she sounded formal and Scottish, whichdidn’t go together with the look at all. At first glance she looked like someone who ought to cackle and put babies into cauldrons, but the wholeeffect was ruined as soon as she opened her mouth. “Is that sufficient,Mr. Potter?” she said. “Shall I go ahead and demonstrate?”“Sufficient? Probably not,” Harry said. “But at least it will help. Goahead, Deputy Headmistress.”“Just Professor will do,” said she, and then, “Wingardium Leviosa.”Harry looked at his father.“Huh,” Harry said.His father looked back at him. “Huh,” his father echoed.Then Professor Verres-Evans looked back at Professor McGonagall.“All right, you can put me down now.”His father was lowered carefully to the ground.Harry ruffled a hand through his own hair. Maybe it was just thatstrange part of him which had already been convinced, but… “That’s a bitof an anticlimax,” Harry said. “You’d think there’d be some kind of moredramatic mental event associated with updating on an observation of infinitesimal probability—” Harry stopped himself. Mum, the witch, andeven his Dad were giving him that look again. “I mean, with finding outthat everything I believe is false.”Seriously, it should have been more dramatic. His brain ought to havebeen flushing its entire current stock of hypotheses about the universe,none of which allowed this to happen. But instead his brain just seemedto be going, All right, I saw the Hogwarts Professor wave her wand and makeyour father rise into the air, now what?The witch-lady was smiling benevolently upon them, looking quiteamused. “Would you like a further demonstration, Mr. Potter?”“You don’t have to,” Harry said. “We’ve performed a definitive experiment. But…” Harry hesitated. He couldn’t help himself. Actually, under the circumstances, he shouldn’t be helping himself. It was right andproper to be curious. “What else can you do?”Professor McGonagall turned into a cat.Harry scrambled back unthinkingly, backpedalling so fast that hetripped over a stray stack of books and landed hard on his bottom witha thwack. His hands came down to catch himself without quite reachingproperly, and there was a warning twinge in his shoulder as the weightcame down unbraced.At once the small tabby cat morphed back up into a robed woman.“I’m sorry, Mr. Potter,” said the witch, sounding sincere, though the corners of her lips were twitching upwards. “I should have warned you.”Harry was breathing in short gasps. His voice came out choked. “Youcan’t DO that!”“It’s only a Transfiguration,” said Professor McGonagall. “An Animagus transformation, to be exact.”“You turned into a cat! A SMALL cat! You violated Conservation ofEnergy! That’s not just an arbitrary rule, it’s implied by the form of thequantum Hamiltonian! Rejecting it destroys unitarity and then you getFTL signalling! And cats are COMPLICATED! A human mind can’t just visualise a whole cat’s anatomy and, and all the cat biochemistry, and whatabout the neurology? How can you go on thinking using a cat-sized brain?”Professor McGonagall’s lips were twitching harder now. “Magic.”“Magic isn’t enough to do that! You’d have to be a god!”Professor McGonagall blinked. “That’s the first time I’ve ever beencalled that.”A blur was coming over Harry’s vision, as his brain started to comprehend what had just broken. The whole idea of a unified universe withmathematically regular laws, that was what had been flushed down thetoilet; the whole notion of physics. Three thousand years of resolving bigcomplicated things into smaller pieces, discovering that the music of theplanets was the same tune as a falling apple, finding that the true lawswere perfectly universal and had no exceptions anywhere and took theform of simple maths governing the smallest parts, not to mention that themind was the brain and the brain was made of neurons, a brain was whata person was—And then a woman turned into a cat, so much for all that.A hundred questions fought for priority over Harry’s lips and thewinner poured out: “And, and what kind of incantation is WingardiumLeviosa? Who invents the words to these spells, nursery schoolers?”“That will do, Mr. Potter,” Professor McGonagall said crisply, thoughher eyes shone with suppressed amusement. “If you wish to learn aboutmagic, I suggest that we finalise the paperwork so that you can go to Hogwarts.”“Right,” Harry said, somewhat dazed. He pulled his thoughts together. The March of Reason would just have to start over, that was all;they still had the experimental method and that was the important thing.“How do I get to Hogwarts, then?”A choked laugh escaped Professor McGonagall, as if extracted fromher by tweezers.“Hold on a moment, Harry,” his father said. “Remember why youhaven’t been going to school up until now? What about your condition?”Professor McGonagall spun to face Michael. “His condition? What’sthis?”“I don’t sleep right,” Harry said. He waved his hands helplessly. “Mysleep cycle is twenty-six hours long, I always go to sleep two hours later,every day. I can’t fall asleep any earlier than that, and then the next day Igo to sleep two hours later than that. 10pm, 12am, 2am, 4am, until it goesaround the clock. Even if I try to wake up early, it makes no difference andI’m a wreck that whole day. That’s why I haven’t been going to a normalschool up until now.”“One of the reasons,” said his mother. Harry shot her a glare.McGonagall gave a long hmmmmm. “I can’t recall hearing about sucha condition before…” she said slowly. “I’ll check with Madam Pomfrey tosee if she knows any remedies.” Then her face brightened. “No, I’m surethis won’t be a problem—I’ll find a solution in time. Now,” and her gazesharpened again, “what are these other reasons?”Harry sent his parents a glare. “I am a conscientious objector to childconscription, on grounds that I should not have to suffer for a disintegrating school system’s failure to provide teachers or study materials ofeven minimally adequate quality.”Both of Harry’s parents howled with laughter at that, like theythought it was all a big joke. “Oh,” said Harry’s father, eyes bright, “is thatwhy you bit a maths teacher in third year.”“She didn’t know what a logarithm was!”“Of course,” seconded Harry’s mother. “Biting her was a very matureresponse to that.”Harry’s father nodded. “A well-considered policy for addressing theproblem of teachers who don’t understand logarithms.”“I was seven years old! How long are you going to keep on bringing thatup?”“I know,” said his mother sympathetically, “you bite one maths teacherand they never let you forget it, do they?”Harry turned to Professor McGonagall. “There! You see what I haveto deal with?”“Excuse me,” said Petunia, and fled through the backdoor into the garden, from which her screams of laughter were clearly audible.“There, ah, there,” Professor McGonagall seemed to be having trouble speaking for some reason, “there is to be no biting of teachers at Hogwarts, is that quite clear, Mr. Potter?”Harry scowled at her. “Fine, I won’t bite anyone who doesn’t bite mefirst.”Professor Michael Verres-Evans also had to leave the room brieflyupon hearing that.“Well,” Professor McGonagall sighed, after Harry’s parents had composed themselves and returned. “Well. I think, under the circumstances,that I should avoid taking you to purchase your study materials until aday or two before school begins.”“What? Why? The other children already know magic, don’t they? Ihave to start catching up right away!”“Rest assured, Mr. Potter,” replied Professor McGonagall, “Hogwartsis quite capable of teaching the basics. And I suspect, Mr. Potter, thatif I leave you alone for two months with your schoolbooks, even withouta wand, I will return to this house only to find a crater billowing purplesmoke, a depopulated city surrounding it and a plague of flaming zebrasterrorising what remains of England.”Harry’s mother and father nodded in perfect unison.“Mum! Dad!”ood Lord,” said the barman, peering at Harry, “is this—can thisbe—?”Harry leaned towards the bar of the Leaky Cauldron as best he could,though it came up to somewhere around the tips of his eyebrows. A question like that deserved his very best.“Am I—could I be—maybe—you never know—if I’m not—but thenthe question is—who?”“Bless my soul,” whispered the old barman. “Harry Potter… what anhonour.”Harry blinked, then rallied. “Well, yes, you’re quite perceptive; mostpeople don’t realise that so quickly—”“That’s enough,” Professor McGonagall said. Her hand tightened onHarry’s shoulder. “Don’t pester the boy, Tom, he’s new to all this.”“But it is him?” quavered an old woman. “It’s Harry Potter?” With ascraping sound, she got up from her chair.“Doris—” McGonagall said warningly. The glare she shot around theroom should have been enough to intimidate anyone.“I only want to shake his hand,” the woman whispered. She bent lowand stuck out a wrinkled hand, which Harry, feeling confused and moreuncomfortable than he ever had in his life, carefully shook. Tears fell fromthe woman’s eyes onto their clasped hands. “My granson was an Auror,”she whispered to him. “Died in seventy-nine. Thank you, Harry Potter.Thank heavens for you.”“You’re welcome,” Harry said automatically, and then he turned hishead and shot Professor McGonagall a frightened, pleading look.Professor McGonagall slammed her foot down just as the generalrush was about to start. It made a noise that gave Harry a new referentfor the phrase “Crack of Doom”, and everyone froze in place.“We’re in a hurry,” Professor McGonagall said in a voice that soundedperfectly, utterly normal.They left the bar without any trouble.“Professor?” Harry said, once they were in the courtyard. He hadmeant to ask what was going on, but oddly found himself asking an entirely different question instead. “Who was that pale man, by the corner?The man with the twitching eye?”“Hm?” said Professor McGonagall, sounding a bit surprised; perhapsshe hadn’t expected that question either. “That was Professor QuirinusQuirrell. He’ll be teaching Defence Against the Dark Arts this year at Hogwarts.”“I had the strangest feeling that I knew him…” Harry rubbed hisforehead. “And that I shouldn’t ought to shake his hand.” Like meetingsomeone who had been a friend, once, before something went drasticallywrong… that wasn’t really it at all, but Harry couldn’t find words. “Andwhat was… all of that?”Professor McGonagall was giving him an odd glance. “Mr. Potter… doyou know… how much have you been told… about how your parents died?”Harry returned a steady look. “My parents are alive and well, and theyalways refused to talk about how my genetic parents died. From which Iinfer that it wasn’t good.”“An admirable loyalty,” said Professor McGonagall. Her voice wentlow. “Though it hurts a little to hear you say it like that. Lily and Jameswere friends of mine.”Harry looked away, suddenly ashamed. “I’m sorry,” he said in a smallvoice. “But I have a Mum and Dad. And I know that I’d just make myselfunhappy by comparing that reality to… something perfect that I built upin my imagination.”“That is amazingly wise of you,” Professor McGonagall said quietly.“But your genetic parents died very well indeed, protecting you.”Protecting me?Something strange clutched at Harry’s heart. “What… did happen?”Professor McGonagall sighed. Her wand tapped Harry’s forehead,and his vision blurred for a moment. “Something of a disguise,” shesaid, “so that this doesn’t happen again, not until you’re ready.” Then herwand licked out again, and tapped three times on a brick wall……which hollowed into a hole, and dilated and expanded and shiveredinto a huge archway, revealing a long row of shops with signs advertisingcauldrons and dragon livers.Harry didn’t blink. It wasn’t like anyone was turning into a cat.And they walked forwards, together, into the wizarding world.There were merchants hawking Bounce Boots (“Made with real Flubber!”) and “Knives +3! Forks +2! Spoons with a +4 bonus!” There weregoggles that would turn anything you looked at green, and a lineup ofcomfy armchairs with ejection seats for emergencies.Harry’s head kept rotating, rotating like it was trying to wind itselfoff his neck. It was like walking through the magical items section of anAdvanced Dungeons and Dragons rulebook (he didn’t play the game, but hedid enjoy reading the rulebooks). Harry desperately didn’t want to miss asingle item for sale, in case it was one of the three you needed to completethe cycle of infinite wish spells.Then Harry spotted something that made him, entirely withoutthinking, veer off from the Deputy Headmistress and start headingstraight into the shop, a front of blue bricks with bronze-metal trim. Hewas brought back to reality only when Professor McGonagall steppedright in front of him.“Mr. Potter?” she said.Harry blinked, then realised what he’d just done. “I’m sorry! I forgotfor a moment that I was with you instead of my family.” Harry gesturedat the shop window, which displayed fiery letters that shone piercinglybright and yet remote, spelling out Bigbam’s Brilliant Books. “When youwalk past a bookshop you haven’t visited before, you have to go in andlook around. That’s the family rule.”“That is the most Ravenclaw thing I have ever heard.”“What?”“Nothing. Mr. Potter, our first step is to visit Gringotts, the bank ofthe wizarding world. Your genetic family vault is there, with the inheritance your genetic parents left you, and you’ll need money for school supplies.” She sighed. “And, I suppose, a certain amount of spending moneyfor books could be excused as well. Though you might want to hold off fora time. Hogwarts has quite a large library on magical subjects. And thetower in which, I strongly suspect, you will be living, has a more broadranging library of its own. Any book you bought now would probably bea duplicate.”Harry nodded, and they walked on.“Don’t get me wrong, it’s a great distraction,” Harry said as his headkept swivelling, “probably the best distraction anyone has ever tried onme, but don’t think I’ve forgotten about our pending discussion.”Professor McGonagall sighed. “Your parents—or your mother at anyrate—may have been very wise not to tell you.”“So you wish that I could continue in blissful ignorance? There is acertain flaw in that plan, Professor McGonagall.”“I suppose it would be rather pointless,” the witch said tightly, “whenanyone on the street could tell you the story. Very well.”And she told him of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, the Dark Lord,Voldemort.“Voldemort?” Harry whispered. It should have been funny, but itwasn’t. The name burned with a cold feeling, ruthlessness, diamond clarity, a hammer of pure titanium descending upon an anvil of yielding flesh.A chill swept over Harry even as he pronounced the word, and he resolvedthen and there to use safer terms like You-Know-Who.The Dark Lord had raged upon wizarding Britain like a wilding wolf,tearing and rending at the fabric of their everyday lives. Other countrieshad wrung their hands but hesitated to intervene, whether out of apathetic selfishness or simple fear, for whichever was first among them tooppose the Dark Lord, their peace would be the next target of his terror.(The bystander effect, thought Harry, thinking of Latane and Darley’sexperiment which had shown that you were more likely to get help if youhad an epileptic fit in front of one person than in front of three. Diffusionof responsibility, everyone hoping that someone else would go first.)The Death Eaters had followed in the Dark Lord’s wake and in his vanguard, carrion vultures to pick at wounds, or snakes to bite and weaken.The Death Eaters were not as terrible as the Dark Lord, but they wereterrible, and they were many. And the Death Eaters wielded more thanwands; there was wealth within those masked ranks, and political power,and secrets held in blackmail, to paralyse a society trying to protect itself.An old and respected journalist, Yermy Wibble, called for increasedtaxes and conscription. He shouted that it was absurd for the many tocower in fear of the few. His skin, only his skin, had been found nailed tothe newsroom wall that next morning, next to the skins of his wife andtwo daughters. Everyone wished for something more to be done, and noone dared take the lead to propose it. Whoever stood out the most becamethe next example.Until the names of James and Lily Potter rose to the top of that list.And those two might have died with their wands in their hands andnot regretted their choices, for they were heroes; but for that they had aninfant child, their son, Harry Potter.Tears were coming into Harry’s eyes. He wiped them away in angeror maybe desperation, I didn’t know those people, not really, they aren’t myparents now, it would be pointless to feel so sad for them—When Harry was done sobbing into the witch’s robes, he looked up,and felt a little bit better to see tears in Professor McGonagall’s eyes aswell.“So what happened?” Harry said, his voice trembling.“The Dark Lord came to Godric’s Hollow,” Professor McGonagall saidin a whisper. “You should have been hidden, but you were betrayed. TheDark Lord killed James, and he killed Lily, and he came in the end to you,to your cot. He cast the Killing Curse at you, and that was where it ended.The Killing Curse is formed of pure hate, and strikes directly at the soul,severing it from the body. It cannot be blocked, and whomever it strikes,they die. But you survived. You are the only person ever to survive. TheKilling Curse rebounded and struck the Dark Lord, leaving only the burnthulk of his body and a scar upon your forehead. That was the end of theterror, and we were free. That, Harry Potter, is why people want to seethe scar on your forehead, and why they want to shake your hand.”The storm of weeping that had washed through Harry had used up allhis tears; he could not cry again, he was done.(And somewhere in the back of his mind was a small, small note ofconfusion, a sense of something wrong about that story; and it shouldhave been a part of Harry’s art to notice that tiny note, but he was distracted. For it is a sad rule that whenever you are most in need of your artas a rationalist, that is when you are most likely to forget it.)Harry detached himself from Professor McGonagall’s side. “I’ll—haveto think about this,” he said, trying to keep his voice under control. Hestared at his shoes. “Um. You can go ahead and call them my parents,if you want, you don’t have to say ‘genetic parents’ or anything. I guessthere’s no reason I can’t have two mothers and two fathers.”There was no sound from Professor McGonagall.And they walked together in silence, until they came before a greatwhite building with vast bronze doors, and carven words above sayingGringotts Bank.of gold Galleons. Stacks of silver Sickles. Piles of bronze Knuts.HeapsHarrystood there, and stared with his mouth open at the familyvault. He had so many questions he didn’t know where to start.From just outside the door of the vault, Professor McGonagallwatched him, seeming to lean casually against the wall, but her eyesintent. Well, that made sense. Being plopped in front of a giant heap ofgold coins was a test of character so pure it was archetypal.“Are these coins the pure metal?” Harry said finally.“What?” hissed the goblin Griphook, who was waiting near thedoor. “Are you questioning the integrity of Gringotts, Mr. Potter-EvansVerres?”“No,” said Harry absently, “not at all, sorry if that came out wrong, sir.I just have no idea at all how your financial system works. I’m asking ifGalleons in general are made of pure gold.”“Of course,” said Griphook.“And can anyone coin them, or are they issued by a monopoly thatthereby collects seigniorage?”“What?” said Professor McGonagall.Griphook grinned, showing sharp teeth. “Only a fool would trust anybut goblin coin!”“In other words,” Harry said, “the coins aren’t supposed to be worthany more than the metal making them up?”Griphook stared at Harry. Professor McGonagall looked bemused.“I mean, suppose I came in here with a ton of silver. Could I get a tonof Sickles made from it?”“For a fee, Mr. Potter-Evans-Verres.” The goblin watched him withglittering eyes. “For a certain fee. Where would you find a ton of silver, Iwonder?”“I was speaking hypothetically,” Harry said. For now, at any rate. “So…how much would you charge in fees, as a fraction of the whole weight?”Griphook’s eyes were intent. “I would have to consult my superiors…”“Give me a wild guess. I won’t hold Gringotts to it.”“A twentieth part of the metal would well pay for the coining.”Harry nodded. “Thank you very much, Mr. Griphook.”So not only is the wizarding economy almost completely decoupled from theMuggle economy, no one here has ever heard of arbitrage. The larger Muggleeconomy had a fluctuating trading range of gold to silver, so every timethe Muggle gold-to-silver ratio got more than 5% away from the weight ofseventeen Sickles to one Galleon, either gold or silver should have drainedfrom the wizarding economy until it became impossible to maintain theexchange rate. Bring in a ton of silver, change to Sickles (and pay 5%),change the Sickles for Galleons, take the gold to the Muggle world, exchange it for more silver than you started with, and repeat.Wasn’t the Muggle gold to silver ratio somewhere around fifty to one?Harry didn’t think it was seventeen, anyway. And it looked like the silvercoins were actually smaller than the gold coins.Then again, Harry was standing in a bank that literally stored yourmoney in vaults full of gold coins guarded by dragons, where you hadto go in and take coins out of your vault whenever you wanted to spendmoney. The finer points of arbitraging away market inefficiencies mightwell be lost on them. He’d been tempted to make snide remarks about thecrudity of their financial system…But the sad thing is, their way is probably better.On the other hand, one competent hedge fundie could probably ownthe whole wizarding world within a week. Harry filed away this notionin case he ever ran out of money, or had a week free.Meanwhile, the giant heaps of gold coins within the Potter vault oughtto suit his near-term requirements.Harry stumped forward, and began picking up gold coins with onehand and dumping them into the other.When he had reached twenty, Professor McGonagall coughed. “Ithink that will be more than enough to pay for your school supplies,Mr. Potter.”“Hm?” Harry said, his mind elsewhere. “Hold on, I’m doing a Fermicalculation.”“A what?” said Professor McGonagall, sounding somewhat alarmed.“It’s a mathematical thing. Named after Enrico Fermi. A way of getting rough numbers quickly in your head…”Twenty gold Galleons weighed a tenth of a kilogram, maybe? Andgold was, what, ten thousand British pounds a kilogram? So a Galleonwould be worth about fifty pounds… The mounds of gold coins looked tobe about sixty coins high and twenty coins wide in either dimension ofthe base, and a mound was pyramidal, so it would be around one-third ofthe cube. Eight thousand Galleons per mound, roughly, and there werearound five mounds of that size, so forty thousand Galleons or 2 millionpounds sterling.Not bad. Harry smiled with a certain grim satisfaction. It was too badthat he was right in the middle of discovering the amazing new world ofmagic, and couldn’t take time out to explore the amazing new world ofbeing rich, which a quick Fermi estimate said was roughly a billion timesless interesting.Still, that’s the last time I ever mow a lawn for one lousy pound.Harry wheeled from the giant heap of money. “Pardon me for asking,Professor McGonagall, but I understand that my parents were in theirtwenties when they died. Is this a usual amount of money for a youngcouple to have in their vault, in the wizarding world?” If it was, a cup oftea probably cost five thousand pounds. Rule one of economics: you can’teat money.Professor McGonagall shook her head. “Your father was the last heirof an old family, Mr. Potter. It’s also possible…” The witch hesitated.“Some of this money may be from bounties placed on You-Know-Who,payable to his ki—ah, to whoever might defeat him. Or those bountiesmight not have been collected yet. I am not sure.”“Interesting…” Harry said slowly. “So some of this really is, in a sense,mine. That is, earned by me. Sort of. Possibly. Even if I don’t remember the occasion.” Harry’s fingers tapped against his trouser-leg. “Thatmakes me feel less guilty about spending a very tiny fraction of it! Don’tpanic, Professor McGonagall!”“Mr. Potter! You are a minor, and as such, you will only be allowed tomake reasonable withdrawals from—”“I am all about reasonable! I am totally on board with fiscal prudenceand impulse control! But I did see some things on the way here whichwould constitute sensible, grown-up purchases…”Harry locked gazes with Professor McGonagall, engaging in a silentstaring contest.“Like what?” Professor McGonagall said finally.“Trunks whose insides hold more than their outsides?”Professor McGonagall’s face grew stern. “Those are very expensive,Mr. Potter!”“Yes, but—” Harry pleaded. “I’m sure that when I’m an adult I’ll wantone. And I can afford one. Logically, it would make just as much senseto buy it now instead of later, and get the use of it right away. It’s thesame money either way, right? I mean, I would want a good one, with lotsof room inside, good enough that I wouldn’t have to just get a better onelater…” Harry trailed off hopefully.Professor McGonagall’s gaze didn’t waver. “And just what would youkeep in a trunk like that, Mr. Potter—”“Books.”“Of course,” sighed Professor McGonagall.“You should have told me much earlier that sort of magic item existed!And that I could afford one! Now my father and I are going to have tospend the next two days frantically hitting up all the secondhand bookshops for old textbooks, so I can have a decent science library with me atHogwarts—and maybe a small science fiction collection, if I can assemble something decent out of the bargain bins. Or better yet, I’ll make thedeal a little sweeter for you, okay? Just let me buy—”“Mr. Potter! You think you can bribe me?”“What? No! Not like that! I’m saying, Hogwarts can keep some of thebooks I bring, if you think that any of them would make good additionsto the library. I’m going to be getting them cheap, and I just want to havethem around somewhere or other. It’s okay to bribe people with books,right? That’s a—”“Family tradition.”“Yes, exactly.”Professor McGonagall’s body seemed to slump, the shoulders lowering within her black robes. “I cannot deny the sense of your words,though I much wish I could. I will allow you to withdraw an additionalhundred Galleons, Mr. Potter.” She sighed again. “I know that I shallregret this, and I am doing it anyway.”“That’s the spirit! And does a ‘mokeskin pouch’ do what I think itdoes?”“It can’t do as much as a trunk,” the witch said with visible reluctance,“but… a mokeskin pouch with a Retrieval Charm and Undetectable Extension Charm can hold a number of items until they are called forth by theone who emplaced them—”“Yes! I definitely need one of those too! It would be like the super beltpack of ultimate awesomeness! Batman’s utility belt of holding! Nevermind my swiss army knife, I could carry a whole tool set in there! Orbooks! I could have the top three books I was reading on me at all times,and just pull one out anywhere! I’ll never have to waste another minuteof my life! What do you say, Professor McGonagall? It’s for the sake ofchildren’s reading, the best of all possible causes.”“…I suppose you may add another ten Galleons.”Griphook was favouring Harry with a gaze of frank respect, possiblyeven outright admiration.“And a little spending money, like you mentioned earlier. I think Ican remember seeing one or two other things I might want to store inthat pouch.”“Don’t push it, Mr. Potter.”“But oh, Professor McGonagall, why rain on my parade? Surely this isa happy day, when I discover all things wizarding for the first time! Whyact the part of the grumpy grownup when instead you could smile andremember your own innocent childhood, watching the look of delightupon my young face as I buy a few toys using an insignificant fraction ofthe wealth that I earned by defeating the most terrible wizard Britain hasever known, not that I’m accusing you of being ungrateful or anything,but still, what are a few toys compared to that?”“You,” growled Professor McGonagall. There was a look on her face sofearsome and terrible that Harry squeaked and stepped back, knockingover a pile of gold coins with a great jingling noise and sprawling backwards into a heap of money. Griphook sighed and put a palm over hisface. “I would be doing a great service to wizarding Britain, Mr. Potter, ifI locked you in this vault and left you here.”And they left without any more trouble.he Moke Shop was a quaint little shop (some might even say cute)ensconced behind a vegetable stall that was behind a magical gloveshop that was on an alleyway off a side street of Diagon Alley. Disappointingly, the shopkeeper was not a wizened ancient crone; just a nervouslooking young woman wearing faded yellow robes. Right now she washolding out a Moke Super Pouch qx31, whose selling point was that it hada Widening Lip as well as an Undetectable Extension Charm: you couldactually fit big things in it, though the total volume was still limited.Harry had insisted on coming here straight away, first thing—insistedas hard as he thought he could without making Professor McGonagallsuspicious. Harry had something he needed to put into the pouch as soonas possible. It wasn’t the bag of Galleons that Professor McGonagall hadallowed him to withdraw from Gringotts. It was all the other Galleonsthat Harry had surreptitiously shoved into his pocket after falling into aheap of gold coins. That had been a real accident, but Harry was neverone to discard an opportunity… though it’d really been more of a spur-ofthe-moment thing. Ever since Harry had been awkwardly carrying theallowed bag of Galleons next to his trouser pocket, so that any jinglingwould seem to come from the right place.This still left the question of how he was actually going to get the othercoins into the pouch without getting caught. The golden coins mighthave been his, but they were still stolen—self-stolen? Auto-thieved?Harry looked up from the Moke Super Pouch qx31 on the counter infront of him. “Can I try this for a bit? To make sure it works, um, reliably?”He widened his eyes in an expression of boyish, playful innocence.Sure enough, after ten repetitions of putting the coin-bag into thepouch, reaching in, whispering “bag of gold”, and taking it out, Professor McGonagall took a step away and began examining some of the otheritems in the shop, and the shopkeeper turned her head to watch.Harry dropped the bag of gold into the mokeskin pouch with his lefthand; his right hand came out of his pocket tightly holding some of thegold coins, reached into the mokeskin pouch, dropped the loose Galleons,and (with a whisper of “bag of gold”) retrieved the original bag. Then thebag went back into his left hand, to be dropped in again, and Harry’s righthand went back into his pocket…Professor McGonagall looked back at him once, but Harry managedto avoid freezing or flinching, and she didn’t seem to notice anything.Though you never did quite know, with the adults that had a sense of humour. It took three iterations to get the job done, and Harry guessed he’dmanaged to steal maybe thirty Galleons from himself.Harry reached up, wiped a bit of sweat from his forehead, and exhaled.“I’d like this one, please.”Fifteen Galleons lighter (twice the price of a wizard’s wand, apparently) and one Moke Super Pouch qx31 heavier, Harry and ProfessorMcGonagall pushed their way out of the door. The door formed a handand waved goodbye to them as they left, extruding its arm in a way thatmade Harry feel a bit queasy.And then, unfortunately…“Are you really Harry Potter?” whispered the old man, one huge tearsliding down his cheek. “You wouldn’t lie about that, would you? Only I’dheard rumours that you didn’t really survive the Killing Curse and that’swhy no one ever heard from you again.”…it seemed that Professor McGonagall’s disguise spell was less thanperfectly effective against more experienced magical practitioners.Professor McGonagall had laid a hand on Harry’s shoulder andyanked him into the nearest alleyway the moment she’d heard “HarryPotter?” The old man had followed, but at least it looked like no one elsehad heard.Harry considered the question. Was he really Harry Potter? “I onlyknow what other people have told me,” Harry said. “It’s not like I remember being born.” His hand brushed his forehead. “I’ve had this scar aslong as I remember, and I’ve been told my name was Harry Potter as longas I remember. But,” Harry said thoughtfully, “if there’s already sufficientcause to postulate a conspiracy, there’s no reason why they wouldn’t justfind another orphan and raise him to believe that he was Harry Potter—”Professor McGonagall drew her hand over her face in exasperation.“You look just about exactly like your father, James, the year he first attended Hogwarts. And I can attest on the basis of personality alone thatyou are related to the Scourge of Gryffindor.”“She could be in on it too,” Harry observed.“No,” quavered the old man. “She’s right. You have your mother’seyes.”“Hmm,” Harry frowned. “I suppose you could be in on it too—”“Enough, Mr. Potter.”The old man raised up a hand as if to touch Harry, but then let it fall.“I’m just glad that you’re alive,” he murmured. “Thank you, Harry Potter.Thank you for what you did… I’ll leave you alone now.”And his cane slowly tapped away, out the alley and down the mainstreet of Diagon Alley.The Professor looked around, her expression tense and grim. Harryautomatically looked around himself. But the alley seemed empty of allbut old leaves, and from the mouth leading out into Diagon Alley, onlyswiftly striding passersby could be seen.Finally Professor McGonagall seemed to relax. “That was not welldone,” she said in a low voice. “I know you’re not used to this, Mr. Potter, but people do care about you. Please be kind to them.”Harry looked down at his shoes. “They shouldn’t,” he said with a tingeof bitterness. “Care about me, I mean.”“You saved them from You-Know-Who,” said Professor McGonagall.“How should they not care?”Harry looked up at the witch-lady’s strict expression beneath herpointed hat, and sighed. “I suppose there’s no chance that if I saidfundamental attribution error you’d have any idea what that meant.”“No,” said the Professor in her precise Scottish accent, “but please explain, Mr. Potter, if you would be so kind.”“Well…” Harry said, trying to figure out how to describe that particular bit of Muggle science. “Suppose you come into work and see yourcolleague kicking his desk. You think, ‘what an angry person he must be’.Your colleague is thinking about how someone bumped him into a wall onthe way to work and then shouted at him. Anyone would be angry at that,he thinks. When we look at others we see personality traits that explaintheir behaviour, but when we look at ourselves we see circumstances thatexplain our behaviour. People’s stories make internal sense to them, fromthe inside, but we don’t see people’s histories trailing behind them in theair. We only see them in one situation, and we don’t see what they wouldbe like in a different situation. So the fundamental attribution error isthat we explain by permanent, enduring traits what would be better explained by circumstance and context.” There were some elegant experiments which confirmed this, but Harry wasn’t about to go into them.The witch’s eyebrows drew up beneath her hat’s brim. “I think I understand…” Professor McGonagall said slowly. “But what does that haveto do with you?”Harry kicked the brick wall of the alley hard enough to make his foothurt. “People think that I saved them from You-Know-Who because I’msome kind of great warrior of the Light.”“The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord…” murmured thewitch, a strange irony leavening her voice.“Yes,” Harry said, annoyance and frustration warring in him, “like Idestroyed the Dark Lord because I have some kind of permanent, enduring destroy-the-Dark-Lord trait. I was fifteen months old at the time! Idon’t know what happened, but I would suppose it had something to dowith, as the saying goes, contingent environmental circumstances. Andcertainly nothing to do with my personality. People don’t care about me,they aren’t even paying attention to me, they want to shake hands with abad explanation.” Harry paused, and looked at McGonagall. “Do you knowwhat really happened?”“I have formed an idea…” said Professor McGonagall. “After meetingyou, that is.”“Yes?”“You triumphed over the Dark Lord by being more awful than he was,and survived the Killing Curse by being more terrible than Death.”“Ha. Ha. Ha.” Harry kicked the wall again.Professor McGonagall chuckled. “Let’s get you to Madam Malkin’snext. I fear your Muggle clothing may be attracting attention.”They ran into two more well-wishers along the way.Madam Malkin’s Robes had a genuinely boring shopfront, red ordinary brick, and glass windows showing plain black robes within. Notrobes that shone or changed or spun, or radiated strange rays thatseemed to go right through your shirt and tickle you. Just plain blackrobes, that was all you could see through the window. The door waspropped wide open, as if to advertise that there were no secrets here andnothing to hide.“I’m going to go off for a few minutes while you get fitted for yourrobes,” said Professor McGonagall. “Will you be all right with that,Mr. Potter?”Harry nodded. He hated clothes shopping with a fiery passion andcouldn’t blame the older witch for feeling the same way.Professor McGonagall’s wand came out of her sleeve, tapped Harry’shead lightly. “And as you’ll need to be clear to Madam Malkin’s senses, Iam removing the Obfuscation.”“Uh…” Harry said. That did worry him a little; he still wasn’t used tothe ‘Harry Potter’ thing.“I went to Hogwarts with Madam Malkin,” McGonagall said. “Eventhen, she was one of the most composed people I knew. She wouldn’t turna hair if You-Know-Who himself walked into her shop.” McGonagall’svoice was reminiscent, and very approving. “Madam Malkin won’t botheryou, and she won’t let anyone else bother you.”“Where are you going?” Harry inquired. “Just in case, you know, something does happen.”McGonagall gave Harry a hard look. “I am going there,” she said, pointing at a building across the street which showed the sign of a wooden keg,“and buying a drink, which I desperately need. You are to get fitted foryour robes, nothing else. I will come back to check up on you shortly, and Iexpect to find Madam Malkin’s shop still standing and not in any way onfire.”Madam Malkin was a bustling old woman who didn’t say a word aboutHarry when she saw the scar on his forehead, and she shot a sharp lookat an assistant when that girl seemed about to say something. MadamMalkin got out a set of animated, writhing bits of cloth that seemed toserve as tape measures and set to work examining the medium of her art.Next to Harry, a pale young boy with a pointed face and awesomecoolblonde-white hair seemed to be going through the final stages of a similarprocess. One of Malkin’s two assistants was examining the white-hairedboy and the chequerboard-gridded robe he was wearing; occasionally shewould tap a corner of the robe with her wand, and the robe would loosenor tighten.“Hello,” said the boy. “Hogwarts, too?”Harry could predict where this conversation was about to go, and hedecided in a split second of frustration that enough was enough.“Good heavens,” whispered Harry, “it couldn’t be.” He let his eyeswiden. “Your… name, sir?”“Draco Malfoy,” said Draco Malfoy, looking slightly puzzled.“It is you! Draco Malfoy. I—I never thought I’d be so honoured, sir.”Harry wished he could make tears come out of his eyes. The others usuallystarted crying at around this point.“Oh,” said Draco, sounding a little confused. Then his lips stretchedin a smug smile. “It’s good to meet someone who knows his place.”One of the assistants, the one who’d seemed to recognise Harry, madea muffled choking sound.Harry burbled on. “I’m delighted to meet you, Mr. Malfoy. Just unutterably delighted. And to be attending Hogwarts in your very year! Itmakes my heart swoon.”Oops. That last part might have sounded a little odd, like he was flirting with Draco or something.“And I am pleased to learn that I shall be treated with the respect dueto the family of Malfoy,” the other boy lobbed back, accompanied by asmile such as the highest of kings might bestow upon the least of his subjects, if that subject were honest, though poor.Eh… Damn, Harry was having trouble thinking up his next line. Well,everyone did want to shake the hand of Harry Potter, so—“When myclothes are fitted, sir, might you deign to shake my hand? I should wishnothing more to put the capper upon this day, nay, this month, indeed,my whole lifetime.”The white-blonde-haired boy glared in return. “And what have youdone for the Malfoys that entitles you to such a favour?”Oh, I am so totally trying this routine on the next person who wants to shakemy hand. Harry bowed his head. “No, no, sir, I understand. I’m sorry forasking. I should be honoured to clean your boots, rather.”“Indeed,” snapped the other boy. His stern face lightened somewhat.“Tell me, what House do you think you might be sorted into? I’m boundfor Slytherin House, of course, like my father Lucius before me. And foryou, I’d guess House Hufflepuff, or possibly House Elf.”Harry grinned sheepishly. “Professor McGonagall says that I’m themost Ravenclaw person she’s ever seen or heard tell of in legend, somuch so that Rowena herself would tell me to get out more, whateverthat means, and that I’ll undoubtedly end up in Ravenclaw House if thehat isn’t screaming too loudly for the rest of us to make out any words,end quote.”“Wow,” said Draco Malfoy, sounding slightly impressed. The boy gavea sort of wistful sigh. “Your flattery was great, or I thought so, anyway—you’d do well in Slytherin House, too. Usually it’s only my father who getsthat sort of grovelling. I’m hoping the other Slytherins will suck up to menow I’m at Hogwarts… I guess this is a good sign, then.”Harry coughed. “Actually, sorry, I’ve got no idea who you are really.”“Oh come on!” the boy said with fierce disappointment. “Why’d you goand do that, then?” Draco’s eyes widened with sudden suspicion. “Andhow do you not know about the Malfoys? And what are those clothes you’rewearing? Are your parents Muggles?”“Two of my parents are dead,” Harry said. His heart twinged. Whenhe put it that way—“My other two parents are Muggles, and they’re theones that raised me.”“What?” said Draco. “Who are you?”“Harry Potter, pleased to meet you.”“Harry Potter?” gasped Draco. “The Harry—” and the boy cut offabruptly.There was a brief silence.Then, with bright enthusiasm, “Harry Potter? The Harry Potter? Gosh,I’ve always wanted to meet you!”Draco’s attendant emitted a sound like she was strangling but kepton with her work, lifting Draco’s arms to carefully remove the chequeredrobe.“Shut up,” Harry suggested.“Can I have your autograph? No, wait, I want a picture with you first!”“Shutupshutupshutup.”“I’m just so delighted to meet you!”“Burst into flames and die.”“But you’re Harry Potter, the glorious saviour of the wizarding world!Everyone’s hero, Harry Potter! I’ve always wanted to be just like you whenI grow up so I can—”Draco cut off the words in mid-sentence, his face freezing in absolutehorror.Tall, white-haired, coldly elegant in black robes of the finest quality.One hand gripping a silver-handled cane which took on the character ofa deadly weapon just by being in that hand. His eyes regarded the roomwith the dispassionate quality of an executioner, a man to whom killingwas not painful, or even deliciously forbidden, but just a routine activitylike breathing.That was the man who had, just that moment, strolled in through theopen door.“Draco,” said the man, low and very angry, “what are you saying?”In one split second of sympathetic panic, Harry formulated a rescueplan.“Lucius Malfoy!” gasped Harry Potter. “The Lucius Malfoy?”One of Malkin’s assistants had to turn away and face the wall.Coolly murderous eyes regarded him. “Harry Potter.”“I am so, so honoured to meet you!”The dark eyes widened, shocked surprise replacing deadly threat.“Your son has been telling me all about you,” Harry gushed on, hardlyeven knowing what was coming out of his mouth but just talking as fastas possible. “But of course I knew about you all before then, everyoneknows about you, the great Lucius Malfoy! The most honoured laureateof all the House of Slytherin, I’ve been thinking about trying to get intoSlytherin House myself just because I heard you were in it as a child—”“What are you saying, Mr. Potter?” came a near-scream from outside theshop, and Professor McGonagall burst in a second later.There was such pure horror on her face that Harry’s mouth openedautomatically, and then blocked on nothing-to-say.“Professor McGonagall!” cried Draco. “Is it really you? I’ve heard somuch about you from my father, I’ve been thinking of trying to get Sortedinto Gryffindor so I can—”“What?” bellowed Lucius Malfoy and Professor McGonagall in perfect unison, standing side-by-side. Their heads swivelled to look at eachother in duplicate motions, and then the two recoiled from one anotheras though performing a synchronised dance.There was a sudden flurry of action as Lucius seized Draco anddragged him out of the shop.And then there was silence.In Professor McGonagall’s left hand lay a small drinking-glass, tiltedover to one side in the forgotten rush, now slowly dripping drops of alcohol into the tiny puddle of red wine that had appeared on the floor.Professor McGonagall strode forward into the shop until she was opposite Madam Malkin.“Madam Malkin,” said Professor McGonagall, her voice calm. “Whathas been happening here?”Madam Malkin looked back silently for four seconds, and thencracked up. She fell against the wall, wheezing out laughter, and that setoff both of her assistants, one of whom fell to her hands and knees on thefloor, giggling hysterically.Professor McGonagall slowly turned to look at Harry, her expressionchilly. “I leave you alone for six minutes. Six minutes, Mr. Potter, by thevery clock.”“I was only joking around,” Harry protested, as the sounds of hysterical laughter went on nearby.“Draco Malfoy said in front of his father that he wanted to be sorted intoGryffindor! Joking around isn’t enough to do that!” Professor McGonagall paused, visibly taking breaths. “What part of ‘get fitted for robes’sounded to you like please cast a Confundus Charm on the entire universe!”“He was in a situational context where those actions made internalsense—”“No. Don’t explain. I don’t want to know what happened in here, ever.Whatever dark power inhabits you, it is contagious, and I don’t want toend up like poor Draco Malfoy, poor Madam Malkin and her two poorassistants.”Harry sighed. It was clear that Professor McGonagall wasn’t in amood to listen to reasonable explanations. He looked at Madam Malkin,who was still wheezing against the wall, and Malkin’s two assistants,who had now both fallen to their knees, and finally down at his own tapemeasure-draped body.“I’m not quite done being fitted for clothes,” Harry said kindly. “Whydon’t you go back and have another drink?”SomeAlley.children would have waited until after their first trip to Diagon“Bag of element 79,” Harry said, and withdrew his hand, empty, fromthe mokeskin pouch.Most children would have at least waited to get their wands first.“Bag of okane,” said Harry. The heavy bag of gold popped up into hishand.Harry withdrew the bag, then plunged it again into the mokeskinpouch. He took out his hand, put it back in, and said, “Bag of tokens ofeconomic exchange.” That time his hand came out empty.“Give me back the bag that I just put in.” Out came the bag of goldonce more.Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres had gotten his hands on at least onemagical item. Why wait?“Professor McGonagall,” Harry said to the bemused witch strollingbeside him, “can you give me two words, one word for gold, and one wordfor something else that isn’t money, in a language that I wouldn’t know?But don’t tell me which is which.”“Ahava and zahav,” said Professor McGonagall. “That’s Hebrew, andthe other word means love.”“Thank you, Professor. Bag of ahava.” Empty.“Bag of zahav.” And it popped up into his hand.“Zahav is gold?” Harry questioned, and Professor McGonagall nodded.Harry thought over his collected experimental data. It was only themost crude and preliminary sort of effort, but it was enough to supportat least one conclusion:“Aaaaaaarrrgh this doesn’t make any sense!”The witch beside him lifted a lofty eyebrow. “Problems, Mr. Potter?”“I just falsified every single hypothesis I had! How can it know that‘bag of 115 Galleons’ is okay but not ‘bag of 90 plus 25 Galleons’? It can countbut it can’t add? It can understand nouns, but not some noun phrases thatmean the same thing? The person who made this probably didn’t speakJapanese and I don’t speak any Hebrew, so it’s not using their knowledge,and it’s not using my knowledge—” Harry waved a hand helplessly. “Therules seem sorta consistent but they don’t mean anything! I’m not evengoing to ask how a pouch ends up with voice recognition and natural language understanding when the best Artificial Intelligence programmerscan’t get the fastest supercomputers to do it after thirty-five years of hardwork,” Harry gasped for breath, “but what is going on?”“Magic,” said Professor McGonagall.“That’s just a word! Even after you tell me that, I can’t make any newpredictions! It’s exactly like saying ‘phlogiston’ or ‘elan vital’ or ‘emergence’ or ‘complexity’!”The black-robed witch laughed aloud. “But it is magic, Mr. Potter.”Harry slumped over a little. “With respect, Professor McGonagall, I’mnot quite sure you understand what I’m trying to do here.”“With respect, Mr. Potter, I’m quite sure I don’t. Unless—this is justa guess, mind—you’re trying to take over the world?”“No! I mean yes—well, no!”“I think I should perhaps be alarmed that you have trouble answeringthe question.”Harry glumly considered the Dartmouth Conference on ArtificialIntelligence in 1956. It had been the first conference ever on the topic,the one that had coined the phrase “Artificial Intelligence”. They hadidentified key problems such as making computers understand language, learn, and improve themselves. They had suggested, in perfectseriousness, that significant advances on these problems might be madeby ten scientists working together for two months.No. Chin up. You’re just starting on the problem of unravelling all the secretsof magic. You don’t actually know whether it’s going to be too difficult to do in twomonths.“And you really haven’t heard of other wizards asking these sorts ofquestions or doing this sort of scientific experimenting?” Harry askedagain. It just seemed so obvious to him.Then again, it’d taken more than two hundred years after the invention of the scientific method before any Muggle scientists had thoughtto systematically investigate which sentences a human four-year-old couldor couldn’t understand. The developmental psychology of linguisticscould’ve been discovered in the eighteenth century, in principle, butno one had even thought to look until the twentieth. So you couldn’treally blame the much smaller wizarding world for not investigating theRetrieval Charm.Professor McGonagall pursed her lips, then shrugged. “I’m still notsure what you mean by ‘scientific experimenting’, Mr. Potter. As I said,I’ve seen Muggleborn students try to get Muggle science to work insideHogwarts, and people invent new Charms and Potions every year.”Harry shook his head. “Technology isn’t the same thing as scienceat all. And trying lots of different ways to do something isn’t the sameas experimenting to figure out the rules.” There were plenty of peoplewho’d tried to invent flying machines by trying out lots of things-withwings, but only the Wright Brothers had built a wind tunnel to measurelift… “Um, how many Muggle-raised children do you get at Hogwarts every year?”“Perhaps ten or so?”Harry missed a step and almost tripped over his own feet. “Ten?”The Muggle world had a population of six billion and counting. Ifyou were one in a million, there were seven of you in London and a thousand more in China. It was inevitable that the Muggle population wouldproduce some eleven-year-olds who could do calculus—Harry knew hewasn’t the only one. He’d met other prodigies in mathematical competitions. In fact he’d been thoroughly trounced by competitors who probably spent literally all day practising maths problems and who’d never reada science-fiction book and who would burn out completely before pubertyand never amount to anything in their future lives because they’d just practised known techniques instead of learning to think creatively. (Harry wassomething of a sore loser.)But… in the wizarding world…Ten Muggle-raised children per year, who’d all ended their Muggleeducations at the age of eleven? And Professor McGonagall might be biased, but she had claimed that Hogwarts was the largest and most eminent wizarding school in the world… and it only educated up to the ageof seventeen.Professor McGonagall undoubtedly knew every last detail of how youwent about turning into a cat. But she seemed to have literally never heardof the scientific method. To her it was just Muggle magic. And she didn’teven seem curious about what secrets might be hiding behind the naturallanguage understanding of the Retrieval Charm.That left two possibilities, really.Possibility one: Magic was so incredibly opaque, convoluted, and impenetrable, that even though wizards and witches had tried their best tounderstand, they’d made little or no progress and eventually given up;and Harry would do no better.Or…Harry cracked his knuckles in determination, but they only made aquiet sort of clicking sound, rather than echoing ominously off the wallsof Diagon Alley.Possibility two: He’d be taking over the world.Eventually. Perhaps not right away.That sort of thing did sometimes take longer than two months. Muggle science hadn’t gone to the moon in the first week after Galileo.But Harry still couldn’t stop the huge smile that was stretching hischeeks so wide they were starting to hurt.Harry had always been frightened of ending up as one of those childprodigies that never amounted to anything and spent the rest of theirlives boasting about how far ahead they’d been at age ten. But then mostadult geniuses never amounted to anything either. There were probablya thousand people as intelligent as Einstein for every actual Einstein inhistory. Because those other geniuses hadn’t gotten their hands on theone thing you absolutely needed to achieve greatness. They’d never foundan important problem.You’re mine now, Harry thought at the walls of Diagon Alley, and allthe shops and items, and all the shopkeepers and customers; and all thelands and people of wizarding Britain, and all the wider wizarding world;and the entire greater universe of which Muggle scientists understoodso much less than they believed. I, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, do nowclaim this territory in the name of Science.Lightning and thunder completely failed to flash and boom in thecloudless skies.“What are you smiling about?” inquired Professor McGonagall, warilyand wearily.“I’m wondering if there’s a spell to make lightning flash in the background whenever I make an ominous resolution,” explained Harry. Hewas carefully memorising the exact words of his ominous resolution sothat future history books would get it right.“I have the distinct feeling that I ought to be doing something aboutthis,” sighed Professor McGonagall.“Ignore it, it’ll go away. Ooh, shiny!” Harry put his thoughts of worldconquest temporarily on hold and skipped over to a shop with an opendisplay, and Professor McGonagall followed.Harry had now bought his potions ingredients and cauldron, and, oh, afew more things. Items that seemed like good things to carry in Harry’sBag of Holding (aka Moke Super Pouch QX31 with Undetectable Extension Charm, Retrieval Charm, and Widening Lip). Smart, sensible purchases.Harry genuinely didn’t understand why Professor McGonagall waslooking so suspicious.Right now, Harry was in a shop expensive enough to display in thetwisting main street of Diagon Alley. The shop had an open front withmerchandise laid out on slanted wooden rows, guarded only by slightgrey glows and a young-looking salesgirl in a much-shortened version ofwitch’s robes that exposed her knees and elbows.Harry was examining the wizarding equivalent of a first-aid kit, theEmergency Healing Pack Plus. There were two self-tightening tourniquets. A syringe of what looked like liquid fire, which was supposed todrastically slow circulation in a treated area while maintaining oxygenation of the blood for up to three minutes, if you needed to prevent a poison from spreading through the body. White cloth that could be wrappedover a part of the body to temporarily numb pain. Plus any number ofother items that Harry totally failed to comprehend, like the “DementorExposure Treatment”, which looked and smelled like ordinary chocolate.Or the “Bafflesnaffle Counter”, which looked like a small quivering eggand carried a placard showing how to jam it up someone’s nostril.“A definite buy at five Galleons, wouldn’t you agree?” Harry said toProfessor McGonagall, and the teenage salesgirl hovering nearby noddedeagerly.Harry had expected the Professor to make some sort of approving remark about his prudence and preparedness.What he was getting instead could only be described as the Evil Eye.“And just why,” Professor McGonagall said with heavy scepticism, “doyou expect to need a healer’s kit, young man?” (After the unfortunate incident at the Potions shop, Professor McGonagall was trying to avoid saying “Mr. Potter” while anyone else was nearby.)Harry’s mouth opened and closed. “I don’t expect to need it! It’s justin case!”“Just in case of what?”Harry’s eyes widened. “You think I’m planning to do something dangerous and that’s why I want a medical kit?”A look of grim suspicion and ironic disbelief was the answer.“Great Scott!” said Harry. (This was an expression he’d learned fromthe mad scientist Doc Brown in Back to the Future.) “Were you also thinking that when I bought the Feather-Falling Potion, the Gillyweed, and thebottle of Food and Water Pills?”“Yes.”Harry shook his head in amazement. “Just what sort of plan do youthink I have going, here?”“I don’t know,” Professor McGonagall said darkly, “but it ends eitherin you delivering a ton of silver to Gringotts, or in world domination.”“World domination is such an ugly phrase. I prefer to call it worldoptimisation.”This hilarious joke failed to reassure the witch giving him the Look ofDoom.“Wow,” Harry said, as he realised that she was serious. “You reallythink that. You really think I’m planning to do something dangerous.”“Yes.”“Like that’s the only reason anyone would ever buy a first-aid kit?Don’t take this the wrong way, Professor McGonagall, but what sort ofcrazy children are you used to dealing with?”“Gryffindors,” spat Professor McGonagall, the word carrying a freightof bitterness and despair that fell like an eternal curse on all youthful enthusiasm and high spirits.“Deputy Headmistress Professor Minerva McGonagall,” Harrysaid, putting his hands sternly on his hips. “I am not going to be inGryffindor—”At this point the Deputy Headmistress interjected something abouthow if he was she would figure out how to kill a hat, which odd remarkHarry let pass without comment, though the salesgirl seemed to be having a sudden coughing fit.“—I am going to be in Ravenclaw. And if you really think that I’m planning to do something dangerous, then, honestly, you don’t understandme at all. I don’t like danger, it is scary. I am being prudent. I am beingcautious. I am preparing for unforeseen contingencies. Like my parents usedto sing to me: Be prepared! That’s the Boy Scout’s marching song! Be prepared!As through life you march along! Don’t be nervous, don’t be flustered, don’t bescared—be prepared!”(Harry’s parents had in fact only ever sung him those particular linesof that Tom Lehrer song, and Harry was blissfully unaware of the rest.)Professor McGonagall’s stance had slightly softened—though mostlywhen Harry had said that he was heading for Ravenclaw. “What sort ofcontingency do you imagine this kit might prepare you for, young man?”“One of my classmates gets bitten by a horrible monster, and as Iscrabble frantically in my mokeskin pouch for something that could helpher, she looks at me sadly and with her last breath says, ‘Why weren’t youprepared?’ And then she dies, and I know as her eyes close that she won’tever forgive me—”Harry heard the salesgirl gasp, and he looked up to see her staring athim with her lips pressed tight. Then the young woman whirled and fledinto the deeper recesses of the shop.What…?Professor McGonagall reached down, and took Harry’s hand in hers,gently but firmly, and pulled Harry out of the main street of Diagon Alley,leading him into an alleyway between two shops which was paved in dirtybricks and dead-ended in a wall of solid black dirt.The tall witch pointed her wand at the main street and spoke, “Quietus”she said, and a screen of silence descended around them, blocking out allthe street noises.What did I do wrong…Professor McGonagall turned to regard Harry. She didn’t have a fulladult Wrongdoing Face, but her expression was flat, controlled. “Youmust remember, Mr. Potter,” she said, “that there was a war in this country not ten years ago. Everyone has lost someone, and to speak of friendsdying in your arms—is not done lightly.”“I—I didn’t mean to—” The inference dropped like a falling stoneinto Harry’s exceptionally vivid imagination. He’d talked about someonebreathing their last breath—and then the salesgirl had run away—andthe war had ended ten years ago so that girl would have been at mosteight or nine years old, when, when, “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to…” Harrychoked up, and turned away to run from the older witch’s gaze but therewas a wall of dirt blocking his way and he didn’t have his wand yet. “I’msorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry!”There came a heavy sigh from behind him. “I know you are, Mr. Potter.”Harry dared to peek behind him. Professor McGonagall only seemedsad, now. “I’m sorry,” Harry said again, feeling wretched. “Did anythinglike that happen to—” and then Harry shut his lips and slapped a handover his mouth for good measure.The older witch’s face grew a little sadder. “You must learn to thinkbefore you speak, Mr. Potter, or else go through life without many friends.That has been the fate of many a Ravenclaw, and I hope it will not beyours.”Harry wanted to just run away. He wanted to pull out a wand anderase the whole thing from Professor McGonagall’s memory, be back withher outside the shop again, make it didn’t happen—“But to answer your question, Mr. Potter, no, nothing like that hasever happened to me. Certainly I’ve watched a friend breathe their last,once or seven times. But not one of them ever cursed me as they died, andI never thought that they wouldn’t forgive me. Why would you say such athing, Mr. Potter? Why would you even think it?”“I, I, I,” Harry swallowed. “It’s just that I always try to imagine theworst thing that could happen,” and maybe he’d also been joking arounda little but he would rather have bitten off his own tongue than say thatnow.“What?” said Professor McGonagall. “But why?”“So I can stop it from happening!”“Mr. Potter…” the older witch’s voice trailed off. Then she sighed, andknelt down beside him. “Mr. Potter,” she said, gently now, “it’s not yourresponsibility to take care of the students at Hogwarts. It’s mine. I won’tlet anything bad happen to you or anyone else. Hogwarts is the safestplace for magical children in all the wizarding world, and Madam Pomfrey has a full healer’s office. You won’t need a healer’s kit at all, let alonea five-Galleon one.”“But I do!” Harry burst out. “Nowhere is perfectly safe! And what ifmy parents have a heart attack or get in an accident when I go home forChristmas—Madam Pomfrey won’t be there, I’ll need a healer’s kit of myown—”“What in Merlin’s name…” Professor McGonagall said. She stood up,and looked down at Harry an expression torn between annoyance andconcern. “There’s no need to think about such terrible things, Mr. Potter!”Harry’s expression twisted up into bitterness, hearing that. “Yes thereis! If you don’t think, you don’t just get hurt yourself, you end up hurtingother people!”Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, then closed it. The witchrubbed the bridge of her nose, looking thoughtful. “Mr. Potter… if I wereto offer to listen to you for a while… is there anything you’d like to talk tome about?”“About what?”“About why you’re convinced you must always be on your guardagainst terrible things happening to you.”Harry stared at her in puzzlement. That was a self-evident axiom.“Well…” Harry said slowly. He tried to organise his thoughts. How couldhe explain himself to a Professor-witch, when she didn’t even know thebasics? “Muggle researchers have found that people are always very optimistic, compared to reality. Like they say something will take two daysand it takes ten days, or they say it’ll take two months and it takes overthirty-five years. For example, in one experiment, they asked studentsfor times by which they were 50% sure, 75% sure, and 99% sure they’d complete their homework, and only 13%, 19%, and 45% of the students finishedby those times. And they found that the reason was that when they askedone group for their best-case estimates if everything went as well as possible, and another group for their average-case estimates if everythingwent as usual, they got back answers that were statistically indistinguishable. See, if you ask someone what they expect in the normal case, they visualise what looks like the line of maximum probability at each step alongthe way—everything going according to plan, with no surprises. But actually, since more than half the students didn’t finish by the time they were99% sure they’d be done, reality usually delivers results a little worse thanthe ‘worst-case scenario’. It’s called the planning fallacy, and the best wayto fix it is to ask how long things took the last time you tried them. That’scalled using the outside view instead of the inside view. But when you’redoing something new and can’t do that, you just have to be really, really,really pessimistic. Like, so pessimistic that reality actually comes out better than you expected around as often and as much as it comes out worse.It’s actually really hard to be so pessimistic that you stand a decent chanceof undershooting real life. Like I make this big effort to be gloomy and Iimagine one of my classmates getting bitten, but what actually happensis that the surviving Death Eaters attack the whole school to get at me.But on a happier note—”“Stop,” said Professor McGonagall.Harry stopped. He had just been about to point out that at least theyknew the Dark Lord wouldn’t attack, since he was dead.“I think I might not have made myself clear,” the witch said, her precise Scottish voice sounding even more careful. “Did anything happen toyou personally that frightened you, Mr. Potter?”“What happened to me personally is only anecdotal evidence,” Harryexplained. “It doesn’t carry the same weight as a replicated, peerreviewed journal article about a controlled study with random assignment, many subjects, large effect sizes and strong statistical significance.”Professor McGonagall pinched the bridge of her nose, inhaled, andexhaled. “I would still like to hear about it,” she said.“Um…” Harry said. He took a deep breath. “There’d been some muggings in our neighborhood, and my mother asked me to return a panshe’d borrowed to a neighbor two streets away, and I said I didn’t wantto because I might get mugged, and she said, ‘Harry, don’t say things likethat!’ Like thinking about it would make it happen, so if I didn’t talk aboutit, I would be safe. I tried to explain why I wasn’t reassured, and she mademe carry over the pan anyway. I was too young to know how statisticallyunlikely it was for a mugger to target me, but I was old enough to knowthat not-thinking about something doesn’t stop it from happening, so Iwas really scared.”“Nothing else?” Professor McGonagall said after a pause, when it became clear that Harry was done. “There isn’t anything else that happenedto you?”“I know it doesn’t sound like much,” Harry defended. “But it was justone of those critical life moments, you see? I mean, I knew that not thinking about something doesn’t stop it from happening, I knew that, but Icould see that Mum really thought that way.” Harry stopped, strugglingwith the anger that was starting to rise up again when he thought aboutit. “She wouldn’t listen. I tried to tell her, I begged her not to send me out,and she laughed it off. Everything I said, she treated like some sort of bigjoke…” Harry forced the black rage back down again. “That’s when I realised that everyone who was supposed to protect me was actually crazy,and that they wouldn’t listen to me no matter how much I begged them,and that I couldn’t ever rely on them to get anything right.” Sometimesgood intentions weren’t enough, sometimes you had to be sane…There was a long silence.Harry took the time to breathe deeply and calm himself down. Therewas no point in getting angry. There was no point in getting angry. Allparents were like that, no adult would lower themselves far enough toplace themselves on level ground with a child and listen, his genetic parents would have been no different. Sanity was a tiny spark in the night,an infinitesimally rare exception to the rule of madness, so there was nopoint in getting angry.Harry didn’t like himself when he was angry.“Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Potter,” said Professor McGonagallafter a while. There was an abstracted look on her face (almost exactly thesame look that had appeared on Harry’s own face while experimenting onthe pouch, if Harry had only seen himself in a mirror to realise that). “Ishall have to think about this.” She turned towards the alley mouthway,and raised her wand—“Um,” Harry said, “can we go get the healer’s kit now?”The witch paused, and looked back at him steadily. “And if I say no—that it is too expensive and you won’t need it—then what?”Harry’s face twisted in bitterness. “Exactly what you’re thinking, Professor McGonagall. Exactly what you’re thinking. I conclude you’re another crazy adult I can’t talk to, and I start planning how to get my handson a healer’s kit anyway.”“I am your guardian on this trip,” Professor McGonagall said with atinge of danger. “I will not allow you to push me around.”“I understand,” Harry said. He kept the resentment out of his voice,and didn’t say any of the other things that came to mind. Professor McGonagall had told him to think before he spoke. He probably wouldn’tremember that tomorrow, but he could at least remember it for five minutes.The witch’s wand made a slight circle in her hand, and the noises ofDiagon Alley came back. “All right, young man,” she said. “Let’s go getthat healer’s kit.”Harry’s jaw dropped in surprise. Then he hurried after her, almoststumbling in his sudden rush.The shop was the same as they had left it, recognisable and unrecognisable items still laid out on the slanted wooden display, the grey glow stillprotecting and the salesgirl back in her old position. The salesgirl lookedup as they approached, her face showing surprise.“I’m sorry,” she said as they got closer, and Harry spoke at almost thesame moment, “I apologise for—”They broke off and looked at each other, and then the salesgirllaughed a little. “I didn’t mean to get you in trouble with Professor McGonagall,” she said. Her voice lowered conspiratorially. “I hope she wasn’ttoo awful to you.”“Della!” said Professor McGonagall, sounding scandalised.“Bag of gold,” Harry said to his pouch, and then looked back up at thesalesgirl while he counted out five Galleons. “Don’t worry, I understandthat she’s only awful to me because she loves me.”He counted out five Galleons to the salesgirl while Professor McGonagall was spluttering something unimportant. “One Emergency HealingPack Plus, please.”It was actually sort of unnerving to see how the Widening Lip swallowed the briefcase-sized medical kit. Harry couldn’t help wonderingwhat would happen if he tried climbing into the mokeskin pouch himself, given that only the person who put something in was supposed to beable to take it out again.When the pouch was done… eating… his hard-won purchase, Harryswore he heard a small burping sound afterward. That had to have beenspelled in on purpose. The alternative hypothesis was too horrifying tocontemplate… in fact Harry couldn’t even think of any alternative hypotheses. Harry looked back up at the Professor, as they began walking throughDiagon Alley once more. “Where to next?”Professor McGonagall pointed toward a shop that looked as if it hadbeen made from flesh instead of bricks and covered in fur instead of paint.“Small pets are permitted at Hogwarts—you could get an owl to send letters, for example—”“Can I pay a Knut or something and rent an owl when I need to sendmail?”“Yes,” said Professor McGonagall.“Then I think emphatically no.”Professor McGonagall nodded, as though ticking off a point. “MightI ask why not?”“I had a pet rock once. It died.”“You don’t think you could take care of a pet?”“I could,” Harry said, “but I would end up obsessing all day long aboutwhether I’d remembered to feed it that day or if it was slowly starving inits cage, wondering where its master was and why there wasn’t any food.”“That poor owl,” the older witch said in a soft voice. “Abandoned likethat. I wonder what it would do.”“Well, I expect it’d get really hungry and start trying to claw its wayout of the cage or the box or whatever, though it probably wouldn’t havemuch luck with that—” Harry stopped short.The witch went on, still in that soft voice. “And what would happen toit afterward?”“Excuse me,” Harry said, and he reached up to take Professor McGonagall by the hand, gently but firmly, and steered her into yet anotheralleyway; after ducking so many well-wishers the process had become almost unnoticeably routine. “Please cast that silencing spell.”“Quietus.”Harry’s voice was shaking. “That owl does not represent me, my parents never locked me in a cupboard and left me to starve, I do not haveabandonment fears and I don’t like the trend of your thoughts, Professor McGonagall!”The witch looked down at him gravely. “And what thoughts wouldthose be, Mr. Potter?”“You think I was,” Harry was having trouble saying it, “I was abused?”“Were you?”“No!” Harry shouted. “No, I never was! Do you think I’m stupid? I knowabout the concept of child abuse, I know about inappropriate touchingand all of that and if anything like that happened I would call the police!And report it to the head teacher! And look up social services in the phonebook! And tell Grandpa and Grandma and Mrs. Figg! But my parentsnever did anything like that, never ever ever! How dare you suggest such athing!”The older witch gazed at him steadily. “It is my duty as Deputy Headmistress to investigate possible signs of abuse in the children under mycare.”Harry’s anger was spiralling out of control into pure, black fury.“Don’t you ever dare breathe a word of these, these insinuations to anyoneelse! No one, do you hear me, McGonagall? An accusation like that canruin people and destroy families even when the parents are completelyinnocent! I’ve read about it in the newspapers!” Harry’s voice was climbing to a high-pitched scream. “The system doesn’t know how to stop, itdoesn’t believe the parents or the children when they say nothing happened! Don’t you dare threaten my family with that! I won’t let you destroy myhome!”“Harry,” the older witch said softly, and she reached out a hand towards him—Harry took a fast step back, and his hand snapped up and knockedhers away.McGonagall froze, then she pulled her hand back, and took a stepbackwards. “Harry, it’s all right,” she said. “I believe you.”“Do you,” Harry hissed. The fury still roaring through his blood. “Orare you just waiting to get away from me so you can file the papers?”“Harry, I saw your house. I saw you with your parents. They love you.You love them. I do believe you when you say that your parents are notabusing you. But I had to ask, because there is something strange at workhere.”Harry stared at her coldly. “Like what?”“Harry, I’ve seen many abused children in my time at Hogwarts, itwould break your heart to know how many. And, when you’re happy, youdon’t behave like one of those children, not at all. You smile at strangers,you hug people, I put my hand on your shoulder and you didn’t flinch.But sometimes, only sometimes, you say or do something that seems verymuch like… someone who spent his first eleven years locked in a cellar.Not the loving family that I saw.” Professor McGonagall tilted her head,her expression growing puzzled again.Harry took this in, processing it. The black rage began to drain away,as it dawned on him that he was being listened to respectfully, and thathis family wasn’t in danger.“And how do you explain your observations, Professor McGonagall?”“I don’t know,” she said. “But it’s possible that something could havehappened to you that you don’t remember.”Fury rose up again in Harry. That sounded all too much like what he’dread in the newspaper stories of shattered families. “Suppressed memoryis a load of pseudoscience! People do not repress traumatic memories, theyremember them all too well for the rest of their lives!”“No, Mr. Potter. There is a Charm called Obliviation.”Harry froze in place. “A spell that erases memories?”The older witch nodded. “But not all the effects of the experience, ifyou see what I’m saying, Mr. Potter.”A chill went down Harry’s spine. That hypothesis… could not be easilyrefuted. “But my parents couldn’t do that!”“Indeed not,” said Professor McGonagall. “It would have taken someone from the wizarding world. There’s… no way to be certain, I’m afraid.”Harry’s rationalist skills began to boot up again. “Professor McGonagall, how sure are you of your observations, and what alternative explanations could there also be?”The witch opened her hands, as though to show their emptiness.“Sure? I’m sure of nothing, Mr. Potter. In all my life I’ve never met anyoneelse like you. Sometimes you just don’t seem eleven years old or even allthat human.”Harry’s eyebrows rose toward the sky—“I’m sorry!” Professor McGonagall said quickly. “I’m very sorry,Mr. Potter. I was trying to make a point and I’m afraid that came outsounding different from what I had in mind—”“On the contrary, Professor McGonagall,” Harry said, and slowlysmiled. “I shall take it as a very great compliment. But would you mindif I offered an alternative explanation?”“Please do.”“Children aren’t meant to be too much smarter than their parents,”Harry said. “Or too much saner, maybe—my father could probablyoutsmart me if he was, you know, actually trying, instead of using hisadult intelligence mainly to come up with new reasons not to change hismind—” Harry stopped. “I’m too smart, Professor. I’ve got nothing to sayto normal children. Adults don’t respect me enough to really talk to me.And frankly, even if they did, they wouldn’t sound as smart as RichardFeynman, so I might as well read something Richard Feynman wroteinstead. I’m isolated, Professor McGonagall. I’ve been isolated my wholelife. Maybe that has some of the same effects as being locked in a cellar.And I’m too intelligent to look up to my parents the way that childrenare designed to do. My parents love me, but they don’t feel obliged to respond to reason, and sometimes I feel like they’re the children—childrenwho won’t listen and have absolute authority over my whole existence. Itry not to be too bitter about it, but I also try to be honest with myself, so,yes, I’m bitter. And I also have an anger management problem, but I’mworking on it. That’s all.”“That’s all?”Harry nodded firmly. “That’s all. Surely, Professor McGonagall, evenin magical Britain, the normal explanation is always worth considering?”It was later in the day, the sun lowering in the summer sky and shoppersbeginning to peter out from the streets. Some shops had already closed;Harry and Professor McGonagall had bought his textbooks from Flourishand Blotts just under the deadline. With only a slight explosion whenHarry had made a beeline for the keyword “Arithmancy” and discoveredthat the seventh-year textbooks invoked nothing more mathematicallyadvanced than trigonometry.At this moment, though, dreams of low-hanging research fruit werefar from Harry’s mind.At this moment, the two of them were walking out of Ollivander’s,and Harry was staring at his wand. He’d waved it, and produced multicoloured sparks, which really shouldn’t have come as such an extra shockafter everything else he’d seen, but somehow—I can do magic.Me. As in, me personally. I am magical; I am a wizard.He had felt the magic pouring up his arm, and in that instant, realisedthat he had always had that sense, that he had possessed it his wholelife, the sense that was not sight or sound or smell or taste or touch butonly magic. Like having eyes but keeping them always closed, so that youdidn’t even realise that you were seeing darkness; and then one day theeye opened, and saw the world. The shock of it had poured through him,touching pieces of himself, awakening them, and then died away in seconds; leaving only the certain knowledge that he was now a wizard, andalways had been, and had even, in some strange way, always known it.And—“It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when itsbrother why, its brother gave you that scar.”That could not possibly be coincidence. There had been thousands ofwands in that shop. Well, okay, actually it could be coincidence, therewere six billion people in the world and thousand-to-one coincidenceshappened every day. But Bayes’s Theorem said that any reasonable hypothesis which made it more likely than a thousand-to-one that he’d endup with the brother to the Dark Lord’s wand, was going to have an advantage.Professor McGonagall had simply said how peculiar and left it at that,which had put Harry into a state of shock at the sheer, overwhelming uncuriosity of wizards and witches. In no imaginable world would Harry havejust went “Hm” and walked out of the shop without even trying to comeup with a hypothesis for what was going on.His left hand rose and touched his scar.What… exactly…“You’re a full wizard now,” said Professor McGonagall. “Congratulations.”Harry nodded.“And what do you think of the wizarding world?” said she.“It’s strange,” Harry said. “I ought to be thinking about everything I’veseen of magic… everything that I now know is possible, and everything Inow know to be a lie, and all the work left before me to understand it. Andyet I find myself distracted by relative trivialities like,” Harry lowered hisvoice, “the whole Boy-Who-Lived thing.” There didn’t seem to be anyonenearby, but no point tempting fate.Professor McGonagall ahemmed. “Really? You don’t say.”Harry nodded. “Yes. It’s just… odd. To find out that you were partof this grand story, the quest to defeat the great and terrible Dark Lord,and it’s already done. Finished. Completely over with. Like you’re FrodoBaggins and you find out that your parents took you to Mount Doom andhad you toss in the Ring when you were one year old and you don’t evenremember it.”Professor McGonagall’s smile had grown somewhat fixed.“You know, if I were anyone else, anyone else at all, I’d probably bepretty worried about living up to that start. Gosh, Harry, what have youdone since you defeated the Dark Lord? Your own bookshop? That’s great! Say,did you know I named my child after you? But I have hopes that this will notprove to be a problem.” Harry sighed. “Still… it’s almost enough to makeme wish that there were some loose ends from the quest, just so I couldsay that I really, you know, participated somehow.”“Oh?” said Professor McGonagall in an odd tone. “What did you havein mind?”“Well, for example, you mentioned that my parents were betrayed.Who betrayed them?”“Sirius Black,” the witch said, almost hissing the name. “He’s in Azkaban. Wizarding prison.”“How probable is it that Sirius Black will break out of prison and I’llhave to track him down and defeat him in some sort of spectacular duel,or better yet put a large bounty on his head and hide out in Australia whileI wait for the results?”Professor McGonagall blinked. Twice. “Not likely. No one has everescaped from Azkaban, and I doubt that he will be the first.”Harry was a bit sceptical of that “no one has ever escaped from Azkaban”line. Still, maybe with magic you could actually get close to a 100% perfectprison, especially if you had a wand and they did not. The best way to getout would be to not go there in the first place.“All right then,” Harry said. “Sounds like it’s been nicely wrapped up.”He sighed, scrubbing his palm over his head. “Or maybe the Dark Lorddidn’t really die that night. Not completely. His spirit lingers, whisperingto people in nightmares that bleed over into the waking world, searchingfor a way back into the living lands he swore to destroy, and now, in accordance with the ancient prophecy, he and I are locked in a deadly duelwhere the winner shall lose and the loser shall win—”Professor McGonagall’s head swivelled, and her eyes darted around,as though to search the street for listeners.“I’m joking, Professor,” Harry said with some annoyance. Sheesh, whydid she always take everything so seriously—A slow sinking sensation began to dawn in the pit of Harry’s stomach.Professor McGonagall looked at Harry with a calm expression. Avery, very calm expression. Then a smile was put on. “Of course you are,Mr. Potter.”Aw crap.If Harry had needed to formalise the wordless inference that had justflashed into his mind, it would have come out something like, ‘If I estimate the probability of Professor McGonagall doing what I just saw asthe result of carefully controlling herself, versus the probability distribution for all the things she would do naturally if I made a bad joke, then thisbehavior is significant evidence for her hiding something.’But what Harry actually thought was, Aw crap.Harry turned his own head to scan the street. Nope, no one nearby.“He’s not dead, is he,” Harry sighed.“Mr. Potter—”“The Dark Lord is alive. Of course he’s alive. It was an act of utter optimism for me to have even dreamed otherwise. I must have taken leave ofmy senses, I can’t imagine what I was thinking. Just because someone saidthat his body was found burned to a crisp, I can’t imagine why I wouldhave thought he was dead. Clearly I have much left to learn about the artof proper pessimism.”“Mr. Potter—”“At least tell me there’s not really a prophecy…” Professor McGonagallwas still giving him that bright, fixed smile. “Oh, you have got to be kidding me.”“Mr. Potter, you shouldn’t go inventing things to worry about—”“Are you actually going to tell me that? Imagine my reaction later,when I find out that there was something to worry about after all.”Her fixed smile faltered.Harry’s shoulders slumped. “I have a whole world of magic to analyse.I do not have time for this.”Then both of them shut up, as a man in flowing orange robes appeared on the street and slowly passed them by; Professor McGonagall’seyes tracked him, unobtrusively. Harry’s mouth was moving as hechewed hard on his lip, and someone watching closely would havenoticed a tiny spot of blood appear.When the orange-robed man had passed into the distance, Harryspoke again, in a low murmur. “Are you going to tell me the truth now,Professor McGonagall? And don’t bother trying to wave it off, I’m notstupid.”“You’re eleven years old, Mr. Potter!” she said in a harsh whisper.“And therefore subhuman. Sorry… for a moment there, I forgot.”“These are dreadful and important matters! They are secret, Mr. Potter! It is a catastrophe that you, still a child, know even this much! Youmust not tell anyone, do you understand? Absolutely no one!”As sometimes happened when Harry got sufficiently angry, his bloodwent cold, instead of hot, and a terrible dark clarity descended over hismind, mapping out possible tactics and assessing their consequenceswith iron realism.Point out that you have a right to know: Failure. Eleven-year-old children donot have rights to know anything, in McGonagall’s eyes.Say that you will not be friends any more: Failure. She does not value yourfriendship sufficiently.Point out that you will be in danger if you do not know: Failure. Plans havealready been made based on your ignorance. The certain inconvenience of rethinking will seem far more unpalatable than the mere uncertain prospect of yourcoming to harm.Justice and reason will both fail. You must either find something you havethat she wants, or find something you can do which she fears…Ah.“Well then, Professor,” Harry said in a low, icy tone, “it sounds likeI have something you want. You can, if you like, tell me the truth, thewhole truth, and in return I will keep your secrets. Or you can try to keepme ignorant so you can use me as a pawn, in which case I will owe younothing.”McGonagall stopped short in the street. Her eyes blazed and her voicedescended into an outright hiss. “How dare you!”“How dare you!” he whispered back at her.“You would blackmail me?”Harry’s lips twisted. “I am offering you a favor. I am giving you a chanceto protect your precious secret. If you refuse I will have every natural motive to make inquiries elsewhere, not to spite you, but because I have toknow! Get past your pointless anger at a child who you think ought to obeyyou, and you’ll realise that any sane adult would do the same! Look at itfrom my perspective! How would you feel if it was YOU?”Harry watched McGonagall, observed her harsh breathing. It occurred to him that it was time to ease off the pressure, let her simmerfor a while. “You don’t have to decide right away,” Harry said in a morenormal tone. “I’ll understand if you want time to think about my offer…but I’ll warn you of one thing,” Harry said, his voice going colder. “Don’ttry that Obliviation spell on me. Some time ago I worked out a signal,and I have already sent that signal to myself. If I find that signal and Idon’t remember sending it…” Harry let his voice trail off significantly.McGonagall’s face was working as her expressions shifted. “I… wasn’tthinking of Obliviating you, Mr. Potter… but why would you have inventedsuch a signal if you didn’t know about—”“I thought of it while reading a Muggle science-fiction book, and saidto myself, well, just in case… And no, I won’t tell you the signal, I’m notdumb.”“I hadn’t planned to ask,” McGonagall said. She seemed to fold in onherself, and suddenly looked very old, and very tired. “This has been anexhausting day, Mr. Potter. Can we get your trunk, and send you home? Iwill trust you not to speak upon this matter until I have had time to think.Keep in mind that there are only two other people in the whole world whoknow about this matter, and they are Headmaster Albus Dumbledore andProfessor Severus Snape.”So. New information; that was a peace offering. Harry nodded in acceptance, and turned his head to look forward, and started walking again,as his blood slowly began to warm over once more.“So now I’ve got to find some way to kill an immortal Dark Wizard,”Harry said, and sighed in frustration. “I really wish you had told me thatbefore I started shopping.”The trunk shop was more richly appointed than any other shop Harryhad visited; the curtains were lush and delicately patterned, the floor andwalls of stained and polished wood, and the trunks occupied places ofhonor on polished ivory platforms. The salesman was dressed in robes offinery only a cut below those of Lucius Malfoy, and spoke with exquisite,oily politeness to both Harry and Professor McGonagall.Harry had asked his questions, and had gravitated to a trunk of heavylooking wood, not polished but warm and solid, carved with the patternof a guardian dragon whose eyes shifted to look at anyone nearing it. Atrunk charmed to be light, to shrink on command, to sprout small clawedtentacles from its bottom and squirm after its owner. A trunk with twodrawers on each of four sides that each slid out to reveal compartmentsas deep as the whole trunk. A lid with four locks each of which wouldreveal a different space inside. And—this was the important part—ahandle on the bottom which slid out a frame containing a staircase leading down into a small, lighted room that would hold, Harry estimated,around twelve bookcases.If they made luggages like this, Harry didn’t know why anyone bothered owning a house.One hundred and eight golden Galleons. That was the price of a goodtrunk, lightly used. At around fifty British pounds to the Galleon, thatwas enough to buy a second-hand car. It would be more expensive thaneverything else Harry had ever bought in his whole life all put together.Ninety-seven Galleons. That was how much was left in the bag of goldHarry had been allowed to take out of Gringotts.Professor McGonagall wore a look of chagrin upon her face. After along day’s shopping she hadn’t needed to ask Harry how much gold wasleft in the bag, after the salesman quoted his price, which meant the Professor could do good mental arithmetic without pen and paper. Onceagain, Harry reminded himself that scientifically illiterate was not at all thesame thing as stupid.“I’m sorry, young man,” said Professor McGonagall. “This is entirelymy fault. I would offer to take you back to Gringotts, but the bank will beclosed for all but emergency services now.”Harry looked at her, wondering…“Well,” sighed Professor McGonagall, as she swung on one heel, “wemay as well go, I suppose.”…she hadn’t lost it completely when a child had dared defy her. Shehadn’t been happy, but she had thought instead of exploding in fury. Itmight have just been that there was an immortal Dark Lord to fight—thatshe had needed Harry’s goodwill. But most adults wouldn’t have beencapable of thinking even that much; wouldn’t consider future consequencesat all, if someone lower in status had refused to obey them…“Professor?” Harry said.The witch turned back and looked at him.Harry took a deep breath. He needed to be a little angry for what hewanted to try now, there was no way he’d have the courage to do it otherwise. She didn’t listen to me, he thought to himself, I would have taken moregold but she didn’t want to listen… Focusing his entire world on McGonagalland the need to bend this conversation to his will, he spoke.“Professor, you thought one hundred Galleons would be more thanenough for a trunk. That’s why you didn’t bother warning me before itwent down to ninety-seven. Which is just the sort of thing the researchstudies show—that’s what happens when people think they’re leavingthemselves a little error margin. They’re not pessimistic enough. If it’dbeen up to me, I’d have taken two hundred Galleons just to be sure. Therewas plenty of money in that vault, and I could have put back any extralater. But I thought you wouldn’t let me do it. I thought you’d be angryat me just for asking. Was I wrong?”“I suppose I must confess that you are right,” said Professor McGonagall. “But, young man—”“That sort of thing is the reason why I have trouble trusting adults.”Somehow Harry kept his voice steady. “Because they get angry if you eventry to reason with them. To them it’s defiance and insolence and a challenge to their higher tribal status. If you try to talk to them they get angry.So if I had anything really important to do, I wouldn’t be able to trust you.Even if you listened with deep concern to whatever I said—because that’salso part of the role of someone playing a concerned adult—you’d neverchange your actions, you wouldn’t actually behave differently, because ofanything I said.”The salesman was watching them both with unabashed fascination.“I can understand your point of view,” Professor McGonagall saideventually. “If I sometimes seem too strict, please remember that I haveserved as Head of Gryffindor House for what feels like several thousandyears.”Harry nodded and continued. “So—suppose I had a way to get moreGalleons from my vault without us going back to Gringotts, but it involvedme violating the role of an obedient child. Would I be able to trust youwith that, even though you’d have to step outside your own role as Professor McGonagall to take advantage of it?”“What?” said Professor McGonagall.“To put it another way, if I could make today have happened differently, so that we didn’t take too little money with us, would that be allright even though it would involve a child being insolent to an adult inretrospect?”“I… suppose…” the witch said, looking quite puzzled.Harry took out the mokeskin pouch, and said, “Eleven Galleons originally from my family vault.”And there was gold in Harry’s hand.For a moment Professor McGonagall’s mouth gaped wide, then herjaw snapped shut and her eyes narrowed and the witch bit out, “Wheredid you get that—”“From my family vault, like I said.”“How?”“Magic.”“That’s hardly an answer!” snapped Professor McGonagall, and thenstopped, blinking.“No, it isn’t, is it? I ought to claim that it’s because I experimentallydiscovered the true secrets of how the pouch works and that it can actually retrieve objects from anywhere, not just its own inside, if you phrasethe request correctly. But actually it’s from when I fell into that pile ofgold before and I shoved some Galleons into my pocket. Anyone who understands pessimism knows that money is something you might needquickly and without much warning. So now are you angry at me for defying your authority? Or glad that we succeeded in our important mission?”The salesman’s eyes were wide like saucers.And the tall witch stood there, silent.“Discipline at Hogwarts must be enforced,” she said after almost a fullminute. “For the sake of all the students. And that must include courtesyand obedience from you to all professors.”“I understand, Professor McGonagall.”“Good. Now let us buy that trunk and go home.”Harry felt like throwing up, or cheering, or fainting, or something.That was the first time his careful reasoning had ever worked on anyone.Maybe because it was also the first time he had something really seriousthat an adult needed from him, but still—Minerva McGonagall, +1 point.Harry bowed, and gave the bag of gold and the extra eleven Galleonsinto McGonagall’s hands. “Thank you very much, Professor. Can you finish up the purchase for me? I’ve got to visit the lavatory.”The salesman, unctuous once more, pointed toward a door set intothe wall with a gold-handled knob. As Harry started to walk away, heheard the salesman ask in his oily voice, “May I inquire as to who that was,Madam McGonagall? I take it he is Slytherin—third-year, perhaps?—andfrom a prominent family, but I did not recognise—”The slam of the lavatory door cut off his words, and after Harry hadidentified the lock and pressed it into place, he grabbed the magicalself-cleaning towel and, with shaky hands, wiped moisture off his forehead. Harry’s entire body was sheathed in sweat which had soaked clearthrough his Muggle clothing, though at least it didn’t show through therobes.The sun was setting and it was very late indeed, by the time they stoodagain in the courtyard of the Leaky Cauldron, the silent leaf-dusted interface between magical Britain’s Diagon Alley and the entire Muggle world.(That was one awfully decoupled economy…) Harry was to go to a phonebox and call his father, once he was on the other side. He didn’t needto worry about his luggage being stolen, apparently. His trunk had thestatus of a major magical item, something that most Muggles wouldn’tnotice; that was part of what you could get in the wizarding world, if youwere willing to pay the price of a secondhand car.“So here we part ways, for a time,” Professor McGonagall said. Sheshook her head in wonderment. “This has been the strangest day of mylife for… many a year. Since the day I learned that a child had defeatedYou-Know-Who. I wonder now, looking back, if that was the last reasonable day of the world.”Oh, like she had anything to complain about. You think your day wassurreal? Try mine.“I was very impressed with you today,” Harry said to her. “I shouldhave remembered to compliment you out loud, I was awarding you pointsin my head and everything.”“Thank you, Mr. Potter,” said Professor McGonagall. “If you had already been sorted into a House I would have deducted so many pointsthat your grandchildren would still be losing the House Cup.”“Thank you, Professor.” It was probably too early to call her Minnie.This woman might well be the sanest adult Harry had ever met, despite her lack of scientific background. Harry was even considering offering her the number-two position in whatever group he formed to fightthe Dark Lord, though he wasn’t silly enough to say that out loud. Nowwhat would be a good name for that…? The Death Eater Eaters?“I’ll see you again soon, when school starts,” Professor McGonagallsaid. “And, Mr. Potter, about your wand—”“I know what you’re going to ask,” Harry said. He took out his precious wand and, with a deep twinge of inner pain, flipped it over in hishand, presenting her with the handle. “Take it. I hadn’t planned to do anything, not a single thing, but I don’t want you to have nightmares aboutme blowing up my house.”Professor McGonagall shook her head rapidly. “Oh no, Mr. Potter!That isn’t done. I only meant to warn you not to use your wand at home,since the Ministry can detect underage magic and it is prohibited withoutsupervision.”“Ah,” Harry said. “That sounds like a very sensible rule. I’m glad to seethe wizarding world takes that sort of thing seriously.”Professor McGonagall peered hard at him. “You really mean that.”“Yes,” Harry said. “I get it. Magic is dangerous and the rules are therefor good reasons. Certain other matters are also dangerous. I get thattoo. Remember that I am not stupid.”“I am unlikely ever to forget it. Thank you, Harry, that does make mefeel better about entrusting you with certain things. Goodbye for now.”Harry turned to go, into the Leaky Cauldron and out towards the Muggle world.As his hand touched the back door’s handle, he heard a last whisperfrom behind him.“Hermione Granger.”“What?” Harry said, his hand still on the door.“Look for a first-year girl named Hermione Granger on the train toHogwarts.”“Who is she?”There was no answer, and when Harry turned around, Professor McGonagall was gone.Aftermath:Headmaster Albus Dumbledore leaned forward over his desk. Histwinkling eyes peered out at Minerva. “So, my dear, how did you findHarry?”Minerva opened her mouth. Then she closed her mouth. Then sheopened her mouth again. No words came out.“I see,” Albus said gravely. “Thank you for your report, Minerva. Youmay go.”etunia Evans-Verres’s lips were trembling and her eyes were tearingup as Harry hugged her midsection on Platform Nine of the King’sCross Station. “Are you sure you don’t want me to come with you, Harry?”Harry glanced over to his father Michael Verres-Evans, who was looking stereotypically stern-but-proud, and then back to his mother, who really did look rather… uncomposed. “Mum, I know you don’t like the wizarding world very much. You don’t have to come with. I mean it.”Petunia winced. “Harry, you shouldn’t worry about me, I’m yourmother and if you need someone with you—”“Mum, I’m going to be on my own at Hogwarts for months and months.If I can’t manage a train platform alone, better to find out sooner ratherthan later so we can abort.” He lowered his voice to a whisper. “Besides,Mum, they all love me over there. If I have any problems, all I need to dois take off my sweatband,” Harry tapped the exercise band covering hisscar, “and I’ll have way more help than I can handle.”“Oh, Harry,” Petunia whispered. She knelt down and hugged himhard, face to face, their cheeks resting against each other. Harry couldfeel her ragged breathing, and then he heard a muffled sob escape. “Oh,Harry, I do love you, always remember that.”It’s like she’s afraid she’ll never see me again, the thought popped intoHarry’s head. He knew the thought was true but he didn’t know why Mumwas so afraid.So he made a guess. “Mum, you know that I’m not going to turn intoyour sister just because I’m learning magic, right? I’ll do any magic youask for—if I can, I mean—or if you want me not to use any magic aroundthe house, I’ll do that too, I promise I’ll never let magic come betweenus—”A tight hug cut off his words. “You have a good heart,” his motherwhispered into his ear. “A very good heart, my son.”Harry choked up himself a little, then.His mother released him, and stood up. She took a handkerchiefout of her handbag, and with a trembling hand dabbed at the runningmakeup around her eyes.There were no questions about his father accompanying him to themagical side of King’s Cross Station. Dad had trouble just looking atHarry’s trunk directly. Magic ran in families, and Michael Verres-Evanscouldn’t even walk.So instead his father just cleared his throat. “Good luck at school,Harry,” he said. “Do you think I bought you enough books?”Harry had explained to his father about how he thought this mightbe his big chance to do something really revolutionary and important,and Professor Verres-Evans had nodded and dumped his extremely busyschedule for two solid days in order to go on the Greatest SecondhandBookshop Raid Ever, which had covered four cities and produced thirtyboxes of science books now sitting in the cavern level of Harry’s trunk.Most of the books had gone for a pound or two, but some of them definitely hadn’t, like the very latest Handbook of Chemistry and Physics or thecomplete 1972 set of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. His father had tried toblock Harry off from seeing the till displays but Harry figured his fathermust have spent at least a thousand pounds. Harry had said to his fatherthat he would pay him back as soon as he figured out how to convert wizarding gold into Muggle money, and his father had told him to go jumpin a lake.And then his father had asked him: Do you think I bought you enoughbooks? It was quite clear what answer Dad wanted to hear.Harry’s throat was hoarse, for some reason. “You can never haveenough books,” he recited the Verres family motto, and his father kneltdown and gave him a quick, firm embrace. “But you certainly tried,”Harry said, and felt himself choking up again. “It was a really, really,really good try.”His Dad straightened. “So…” he said. “Do you see a Platform Nine andThree-Quarters?”King’s Cross Station was huge and busy, with walls and floors pavedwith ordinary dirt-stained tiles. It was full of ordinary people hurryingabout their ordinary business, having ordinary conversations which generated lots and lots of ordinary noise. King’s Cross Station had a PlatformNine (which they were standing on) and a Platform Ten (right nearby) butthere was nothing between Platform Nine and Platform Ten except a thin,unpromising barrier wall. A great skylight overhead let in plenty of lightto illuminate the total lack whatsoever of any Platform Nine and ThreeQuarters.Harry stared around until his eyes watered, thinking, come on, magesight, come on, mage-sight, but absolutely nothing appeared to him. Hethought about taking out his wand and waving it, but Professor McGonagall had warned him against using his wand. Plus if there was anothershower of multicoloured sparks that might lead to being arrested for setting off fireworks inside a train station. And that was assuming his wanddidn’t decide to do something else, like blowing up all of King’s Cross.Harry had only lightly skimmed his schoolbooks (though that skim wasquite bizarre enough) in a very quick effort to determine what sort of science books to buy over the next 48 hours.Well, he had—Harry glanced at his watch—one whole hour to figureit out, since he was supposed to be on the train at eleven. Maybe this wasthe equivalent of an IQ test and the stupid kids couldn’t become wizards.(And the amount of extra time you gave yourself would determine yourConscientiousness, which was the second most important factor in scholarly success.)“I’ll figure it out,” Harry said to his waiting parents. “It’s probablysome sort of test thingy.”His father frowned. “Hm… maybe look for a trail of mixed footprintson the ground, leading somewhere that doesn’t seem to make sense—”“Dad!” Harry said. “Stop that! I haven’t even tried to figure it out onmy own!” It was a very good suggestion, too, which was worse.“Sorry,” his father apologised.“Ah…” Harry’s mother said. “I don’t think they would do that to astudent, do you? Are you sure Professor McGonagall didn’t tell you anything?”“Maybe she was distracted,” Harry said without thinking.“Harry!” hissed his father and mother in unison. “What did you do?”“I, um—” Harry swallowed. “Look, we don’t have time for this now—”“Harry!”“I mean it! We don’t have time for this now! Because it’s a really longstory and I’ve got to figure out how to get to school!”His mother had a hand over her face. “How bad was it?”“I, ah,” I can’t talk about that for reasons of National Security, “about halfas bad as the Incident with the Science Project?”“Harry!”“I, er, oh look there are some people with an owl I’ll go ask them howto get in!” and Harry ran away from his parents towards the family offiery redheads, his trunk automatically slithering behind him.The plump woman looked to him as he arrived. “Hello, dear. Firsttime at Hogwarts? Ron’s new, too—” and then she peered closely at him.“Harry Potter?”Four boys and a red-headed girl and an owl all swung around and thenfroze in place.“Oh, come on!” Harry protested. He’d been planning to go as HarryVerres at least until he got to Hogwarts. “I bought a sweatband and everything! How come you know who I am?”“Yes,” Harry’s father said, coming up behind him with long easystrides, “how do you know who he is?” His voice indicated a certaindread.“Your picture was in the newspapers,” said one of two identicallooking twins.“Dad! It’s not like that! It’s ’cause I defeated the Dark Lord You-KnowWho when I was one year old!”“Mum can explain.”“Ah… Michael dear, there are certain things I thought it would be bestnot to bother you with until now—”“Excuse me,” Harry said to the redheaded family who were all staringat him, “but it would be quite extremely helpful if you could tell me howto get to Platform Nine and Three Quarters right now.”“Ah…” said the woman. She raised a hand and pointed at the wall between platforms. “Just walk straight at the barrier between platformsnine and ten. Don’t stop and don’t be scared you’ll crash into it, that’svery important. Best do it at a bit of a run if you’re nervous.”“And whatever you do, don’t think of an elephant.”“George! Ignore him, Harry dear, there’s no reason not to think of anelephant.”“I’m Fred, Mum, not George—”“Thanks!” Harry said and took off at a run towards the barrier—Wait a minute, it wouldn’t work unless he believed in it?It was at times like this that Harry hated his mind for actually working fast enough to realise that this was a case where “resonant doubt” applied, that is, if he’d started out thinking that he would go through thebarrier he’d have been fine, only now he was worried about whether hesufficiently believed he’d go through the barrier, which meant that he actually was worried about crashing into it—“Harry! Get back here, you have some explaining to do!” That was his Dad.Harry shut his eyes and ignored everything he knew about justifiedcredibility and just tried to believe really hard that he’d go through thebarrier and——the sounds around him changed.Harry opened his eyes and stumbled to a halt, feeling vaguely dirtiedby having made a deliberate effort to believe something.He was standing in a bright, open-air platform next to a single hugetrain, fourteen long carriages headed up by a massive scarlet-metalsteam engine with a tall chimney that promised death to air quality. Theplatform was already lightly crowded (even though Harry was a full hourearly); dozens of children and their parents swarmed around benches,tables, and various hawkers and stalls.It went entirely without saying that there was no such place in King’sCross Station and no room to hide it.Okay, so either (a) I just teleported somewhere else entirely (b) they can foldspace like no one’s business or (c) they are simply ignoring all the rules.There was a slithering sound behind him, and Harry turned aroundto observe that his trunk had indeed followed him on its small clawed tentacles. Apparently, for magical purposes, his luggage had also managedto believe with sufficient strength to pass through the barrier. That wasactually a little disturbing when Harry started thinking about it.A moment later, the youngest-looking red-haired boy came throughthe iron archway (iron archway?) at a run, pulling his trunk behind himon a lead and nearly crashing into Harry. Harry, feeling stupid for havingstayed around, quickly began moving away from the landing area, andthe red-haired boy followed him, yanking hard on his trunk’s lead in orderto keep up. A moment later, a white owl fluttered through the archwayand came to rest on the boy’s shoulder.“Cor,” said the red-haired boy, “are you really Harry Potter?”Not this again. “I have no logical way of knowing that for certain.My parents raised me to believe that my name was Harry James PotterEvans-Verres, and many people here have told me that I look like myparents, I mean my other parents, but,” Harry frowned, realising, “for allI know, there could easily be spells to polymorph a child into a specifiedappearance—”“Er, what, mate?”Not headed for Ravenclaw, I take it. “Yes, I’m Harry Potter.”“I’m Ron Weasley,” said the tall skinny freckled long-nosed kid, andstuck out a hand, which Harry politely shook as they walked. The owlgave Harry an oddly measured and courteous hoot (actually more of aneehhhhh sound, which surprised Harry).At this point Harry realised the potential for imminent catastrophe.“Just a second,” he said to Ron, and opened one of the drawers of his trunk,the one that if he recalled correctly was for Winter Clothes—it was—andthen he found the lightest scarf he owned, underneath his winter coat.Harry took off his sweatband, and just as quickly unfolded the scarf andtied it around his face. It was a little hot, especially in the summer, butHarry could live with that.Then he shut that drawer and pulled out another drawer and drewforth black wizarding robes, which he shrugged over his head, now thathe was out of Muggle territory.“There,” Harry said. The sound came out slightly muffled through thescarf over his face. He turned to Ron. “How do I look? Stupid, I know, butam I identifiable as Harry Potter?”“Er,” Ron said. He closed his mouth, which had been open. “Not really,Harry.”“Very good,” Harry said. “However, so as not to obviate the point ofthe whole exercise, you will henceforth address me as,” Verres might notwork anymore, “Mr. Spoo.”“Okay, Harry,” Ron said uncertainly.The Force is not particularly strong in this one. “Call… me… Mister… Spoo.”“Okay, Mister Spoo—” Ron stopped. “I can’t do that, it makes me feelstupid.”That’s not just a feeling. “Okay. You pick a name.”“Mr. Cannon,” Ron said at once. “For the Chudley Cannons.”“Ah…” Harry knew he was going to terribly regret asking this. “Whoor what are the Chudley Cannons?”“Who’re the Chudley Cannons? Only the most brilliant team in the wholehistory of Quidditch! Sure, they finished at the bottom of the league lastyear, but—”“What’s Quidditch?”Asking this was also a mistake.“So let me get this straight,” Harry said as it seemed that Ron’s explanation (with associated hand gestures) was winding down. “Catching theSnitch is worth one hundred and fifty points?”“Yeah—”“How many ten-point goals does one side usually score not countingthe Snitch?”“Um, maybe fifteen or twenty in professional games—”“That’s just wrong. That violates every possible rule of game design.Look, the rest of this game sounds like it might make sense, sort of, fora sport I mean, but you’re basically saying that catching the Snitch overwhelms almost any ordinary point spread. The two Seekers are up thereflying around looking for the Snitch and usually not interacting with anyone else, spotting the Snitch first is going to be mostly luck—”“It’s not luck!” protested Ron. “You’ve got to keep your eyes movingin the right pattern—”“That’s not interactive, there’s no back-and-forth with the other playerand how much fun is it to watch someone incredibly good at movingtheir eyes? And then whichever Seeker gets lucky swoops in and grabsthe Snitch and makes everyone else’s work moot. It’s like someone took areal game and grafted on this pointless extra position so that you could bethe Most Important Player without needing to really get involved or learnthe rest of it. Who was the first Seeker, the King’s idiot son who wantedto play Quidditch but couldn’t understand the rules?” Actually, now thatHarry thought about it, that seemed like a surprisingly good hypothesis.Put him on a broomstick and tell him to catch the shiny thing…Ron’s face pulled into a scowl. “If you don’t like Quidditch, you don’thave to make fun of it!”“If you can’t criticise, you can’t optimise. I’m suggesting how to improve the game. And it’s very simple. Get rid of the Snitch.”“They won’t change the game just ’cause you say so!”“I am the Boy-Who-Lived, you know. People will listen to me. Andmaybe if I can persuade them to change the game at Hogwarts, the innovation will spread.”A look of absolute horror was spreading over Ron’s face. “But, but ifyou get rid of the Snitch, how will anyone know when the game ends?”“Buy… a… clock. It would be a lot fairer than having the game sometimes end after ten minutes and sometimes not end for hours, and theschedule would be a lot more predictable for the spectators, too.” Harrysighed. “Oh, stop giving me that look of absolute horror, I probably won’tactually take the time to destroy this pathetic excuse for a national sportand remake it stronger and smarter in my own image. I’ve got way, way,way more important stuff to worry about.” Harry looked thoughtful.“Then again, it wouldn’t take much time to write up the Ninety-FiveTheses of the Snitchless Reformation and nail it to a church door—”“Potter,” drawled a young boy’s voice, “what is that on your face andwhat is standing next to you?”Ron’s look of horror was replaced by utter hatred. “You!”Harry turned his head; and indeed it was Draco Malfoy, who mighthave been forced to wear standard school robes, but was making up forthat with a trunk looking at least as magical and far more elegant thanHarry’s own, decorated in silver and emeralds and bearing what Harryguessed to be the Malfoy family crest, a beautiful fanged serpent overcrossed ivory wands.“Draco!” Harry said. “Er, or Malfoy if you prefer, though that kind ofsounds like Lucius to me. I’m glad to see you’re doing so well after, um,our last meeting. This is Ron Weasley. And I’m trying to go incognito, socall me, eh,” Harry looked down at his robes, “Mister Black.”“Harry!” hissed Ron. “You can’t use that name!”Harry blinked. “Why not?” It sounded nicely dark, like an internationalman of mystery—“I’d say it’s a fine name,” said Draco, “but it belongs to the Noble andMost Ancient House of Black. I’ll call you Mr. Silver.”“You get away from… from Mr. Gold,” Ron said coldly, and took a forward step. “He doesn’t need to talk to the likes of you!”Harry raised a placating hand. “I’ll go by Mr. Bronze, thanks for thenaming schema. And, Ron, um,” Harry struggled to find a way to saythis, “I’m glad you’re so… enthusiastic about protecting me, but I don’tparticularly mind talking to Draco—”This was apparently the last straw for Ron, who spun on Harry witheyes now aflame with outrage. “What? Do you know who this is?”“Yes, Ron,” Harry said, “you may remember that I called him Dracowithout him needing to introduce himself.”Draco sniggered. Then his eyes lit on the white owl on Ron’s shoulder.“Oh, what’s this?” Draco said in a drawl rich with malice. “Where’s thefamous Weasley family rat?”“Buried in the backyard,” Ron said coldly.“Aw, how sad. Pot… ah, Mr. Bronze, I should mention that theWeasley family is widely agreed to have the best pet story ever. Want to tellit, Weasley?”Ron’s face contorted. “You wouldn’t think it was funny if it happenedto your family!”“Oh,” Draco purred, “but it wouldn’t ever happen to the Malfoys.”Ron’s hands clenched into fists—“That’s enough,” Harry said, putting as much quiet authority into thevoice as he could manage. It was clear that whatever this was about, itwas a painful memory for the red-haired kid. “If Ron doesn’t want to talkabout it, he doesn’t have to talk about it, and I’d ask that you not talk aboutit either.”Draco turned a surprised look on Harry, and Ron nodded. “That’sright, Harry! I mean Mr. Bronze! You see what kind of person he is? Nowtell him to go away!”Harry counted to ten inside his head, which for him was a very quick12345678910—an odd habit left over from the age of five when his motherhad first instructed him to do it, and Harry had reasoned that his way wasfaster and ought to be just as effective. “I’m not telling him to go away,”Harry said calmly. “He’s welcome to talk to me if he wants.”“Well, I don’t intend to hang around with anyone who hangs aroundwith Draco Malfoy,” Ron announced coldly.Harry shrugged. “That’s up to you. I don’t intend to let anyone saywho I can and can’t hang around with.” Silently chanting, please go away,please go away…Ron’s face went blank with surprise, like he’d actually expectedthat line to work. Then Ron spun about, yanked his luggage’s lead andstormed off down the platform.“If you didn’t like him,” Draco said curiously, “why didn’t you just walkaway?”“Um… his mother helped me figure out how to get to this platformfrom the King’s Cross Station, so it was kind of hard to tell him to getlost. And it’s not that I hate this Ron guy,” Harry said, “I just, just…” Harrysearched for words.“Don’t see any reason for him to exist?” offered Draco.“Pretty much.”“Anyway, Potter… if you really were raised by Muggles—” Dracopaused here, as if waiting for a denial, but Harry didn’t say anything “—then you mightn’t know what it’s like to be famous. People want to takeup all of our time. You have to learn to say no.”Harry nodded, putting a thoughtful look on his face. “That soundslike good advice.”“If you try to be nice, you just end up spending the most time withthe pushiest ones. Decide who you want to spend time with and makeeveryone else leave. You’re just getting here, Potter, so everyone’s goingto judge you by who they see you with, and you don’t want to be seen withthe likes of Ron Weasley.”Harry nodded again. “If you don’t mind my asking, how did you recognise me?”“Mister Bronze,” Draco drawled, “I have met you, remember. I sawsomeone going around with a scarf wrapped around his head, lookingabsolutely ridiculous. So I took a guess.”Harry bowed his head, accepting the compliment. “I’m terribly sorryabout that,” Harry said. “Our first meeting, I mean. I didn’t mean to embarrass you in front of Lucius.”Draco waved it off while giving Harry an odd look. “I just wish Fathercould have come in while you were flattering me—” Draco laughed. “Butthank you for what you said to Father. If not for that, I might’ve had aharder time explaining.”Harry swept a deeper bow. “And thank you for reciprocating withwhat you said to Professor McGonagall.”“You’re welcome. Though one of the assistants must’ve sworn herclosest friend to absolute secrecy, because Father says there’re weird rumors going around, like you and I got in a fight or something.”“Ouch,” Harry said, wincing. “I’m really sorry—”“No, we’re used to it, Merlin knows there’s lots of rumors about theMalfoy family already.”Harry nodded. “I’m glad to hear you’re not in trouble.”Draco smirked. “Father has, um, a refined sense of humor, but he doesunderstand making friends. He understands it very well. He made merepeat that before I went to bed every night for the last month, ‘I will makefriends at Hogwarts.’ When I explained everything to him and he sawthat’s what I was doing, he bought me an ice-cream.”Harry’s jaw dropped. “You managed to spin that into an ice-cream?”Draco nodded, looking every bit as smug as the feat deserved. “Well,father knew what I was doing, of course, but he’s the one who taught mehow to do it, and if I grin the right way while I’m doing it, that makes it afather-son thing and then he has to buy me an ice-cream or I’ll give himthis sort of sad look, like I think I must have disappointed him.”Harry eyed Draco calculatingly, sensing the presence of another master. “You’ve had lessons on how to manipulate people?”“Of course,” Draco said proudly. “I’m a Malfoy. Father bought me tutors.”“Wow,” Harry said. Reading Robert Cialdini’s Influence: Science andPractice probably didn’t stack up very high compared to that (though itwas still one heck of a book). “Your dad is almost as awesome as my dad.”Draco’s eyebrows rose loftily. “Oh? And what does your father do?”“He buys me books.”Draco considered this. “That doesn’t sound very impressive.”“You had to be there. Anyway, I’m glad to hear all that. The way Luciuswas looking at you, I thought he was going to c-crucify you.”“My father really loves me,” Draco said firmly. “He wouldn’t ever dothat.”“Um…” Harry said. He remembered the black-robed, white-haired figure of elegance that had stormed through Madam Malkin’s, wielding thatbeautiful, deadly silver-handled cane. It wasn’t easy to visualise him as adoting father. “Don’t take this the wrong way, but how do you know that?”“Huh?” It was clear that this was a question Draco did not commonlyask himself.“I ask the fundamental question of rationality: Why do you believewhat you believe? What do you think you know and how do you think youknow it? What makes you think Lucius wouldn’t sacrifice you the sameway he’d sacrifice anything else for power?”Draco shot Harry another odd look. “Just what do you know aboutFather?”“Um… seat on the Wizengamot, seat on Hogwarts’ Board of Governors, incredibly wealthy, has the ear of Minister Fudge, has the confidence of Minister Fudge, probably has some highly embarrassing photosof Minister Fudge, most prominent blood purist now that the Dark Lord’sgone, former Death Eater who was found to have the Dark Mark but gotoff by claiming to be under the Imperius Curse, which was ridiculouslyimplausible and pretty much everyone knew it… evil with a capital ‘E’ anda born killer… I think that’s it.”Draco’s eyes had narrowed to slits. “McGonagall told you that, didshe.”“No, she wouldn’t say anything to me about Lucius afterwards, exceptto stay away from him. So during the Incident at the Potions Shop, whileProfessor McGonagall was busy yelling at the shopkeeper and trying toget everything under control, I grabbed one of the customers and askedthem about Lucius.”Draco’s eyes were wide again. “Did you really?”Harry gave Draco a puzzled look. “If I lied the first time, I’m not goingto tell you the truth just because you ask twice.”There was a certain pause as Draco absorbed this.“You’re so completely going to be in Slytherin.”“I’m so completely going to be in Ravenclaw, thank you very much. Ionly want power so I can get books.”Draco giggled. “Yeah, right. Anyway… to answer what you asked…”Draco took a deep breath, and his face turned serious. “Father oncemissed a Wizengamot vote for me. I was on a broom and I fell off andbroke a lot of ribs. It really hurt. I’d never hurt that much before and Ithought I was going to die. So Father missed this really important vote,because he was there by my bed at St. Mungo’s, holding my hands andpromising me that I was going to be okay.”Harry glanced away uncomfortably, then, with an effort, forced himself to look back at Draco. “Why are you telling me that? It seems sort of…private…”Draco gave Harry a serious look. “One of my tutors once said that people form close friendships by knowing private things about each other,and the reason most people don’t make close friends is because they’retoo embarrassed to share anything really important about themselves.”Draco turned his palms out invitingly. “Your turn?”Knowing that Draco’s hopeful face had probably been drilled into himby months of practice did not make it any less effective, Harry observed.Actually it did make it less effective, but unfortunately not ineffective. Thesame could be said of Draco’s clever use of reciprocation pressure for anunsolicited gift, a technique which Harry had read about in his social psychology books (one experiment had shown that an unconditional gift of$5 was twice as effective as a conditional offer of $50 in getting peopleto fill out surveys). Draco had made an unsolicited gift of a confidence,and now invited Harry to offer a confidence in return… and the thing was,Harry did feel pressured. Refusal, Harry was certain, would be met witha look of sad disappointment, and maybe a small amount of contemptindicating that Harry had lost points.“Draco,” Harry said, “just so you know, I recognise exactly what you’redoing right now. My own books called it reciprocation and they talk abouthow giving someone a straight gift of two Sickles was found to be twiceas effective as offering them twenty Sickles in getting them to do whatyou want…” Harry trailed off.Draco was looking sad and disappointed. “It’s not meant as a trick,Harry. It’s a real way of becoming friends.”Harry held up a hand. “I didn’t say I wasn’t going to respond. I justneed time to pick something that’s private but just as non-damaging.Let’s say… I wanted you to know that I can’t be rushed into things.” Apause to reflect could go a long way in defusing the power of a lot ofcompliance techniques, once you learned to recognise them for whatthey were.“All right,” Draco said. “I’ll wait while you come up with something.Oh, and please take off the scarf while you say it.”Simple but effective.And Harry couldn’t help but notice how clumsy, awkward, gracelesshis attempt at resisting manipulation / saving face / showing off had appeared compared to Draco. I need those tutors.“All right,” Harry said after a time. “Here’s mine.” He glanced aroundand then rolled the scarf back up over his face, exposing everything butthe scar. “Um… it sounds like you can really rely on your father. I mean… ifyou talk to him seriously, he’ll always listen to you and take you seriously.”Draco nodded.“Sometimes,” Harry said, and swallowed. This was surprisingly hard,but then it was meant to be. “Sometimes I wish my own Dad was likeyours.” Harry’s eyes flinched away from Draco’s face, more or less automatically, and then Harry forced himself to look back at Draco.Then it hit Harry what on Earth he’d just said, and Harry hastily added,“Not that I wish my Dad was a flawless instrument of death like Lucius, Ionly mean taking me seriously—”“I understand,” Draco said with a smile. “There… now doesn’t it feellike we’re a little closer to being friends?”Harry nodded. “Yeah. It does, actually. Um… no offence, but I’m going to put on my disguise again, I really don’t want to deal with—”“I understand.”Harry rolled the scarf back down over his face.“My father takes all his friends seriously,” Draco said. “That’s why hehas lots of friends. You should meet him.”“I’ll think about it,” Harry said in a neutral voice. He shook his headin wonder. “So you really are his one weak point. Huh.”Now Draco was giving Harry a really odd look. “You want to go getsomething to drink and find somewhere to sit down?”Harry realised he had been standing in one place for too long, andstretched himself, trying to crick his back. “Sure.”The platform was starting to fill up now, but there was still a quieterarea on the far side away from the red steam engine. Along the way theypassed a stall containing a bald, bearded man offering newspapers andcomic books and stacked neon-green cans.The stallholder was, in fact, leaning back and drinking out of one ofthe neon-green cans at the exact point when he spotted the refined and elegant Draco Malfoy approaching along with a mysterious boy looking incredibly stupid with a scarf tied over his face, causing the stallholder to experience a sudden coughing fit in mid-drink and dribble a large amountof neon-green liquid onto his beard.“’Scuse me,” Harry said, “but what is that stuff, exactly?”“Comed-Tea,” said the stallholder. “If you drink it, something surprising is bound to happen which makes you spill it on yourself or someoneelse. But it’s charmed to vanish just a few seconds later—” Indeed thestain on his beard was already disappearing.“How droll,” said Draco. “How very, very droll. Come, Mr. Bronze,let’s go find another—”“Hold on,” Harry said.“Oh come on! That’s just, just juvenile!”“No, I’m sorry Draco, I have to investigate this. What happens if Idrink Comed-Tea while doing my best to keep the conversation completely serious?”The stallholder smiled mysteriously. “Who knows? A friend walks byin a frog costume? Something unexpected is bound to happen—”“No. I’m sorry. I just don’t believe it. That violates my much-abusedsuspension of disbelief on so many levels I don’t even have the languageto describe it. There is, there is just no way a bloody drink can manipulatereality to produce comedy setups, or I’m going to give up and retire to theBahamas—”Draco groaned. “Are we really going to do this?”“You don’t have to drink it but I have to investigate. Have to. Howmuch?”“Five Knuts the can,” the stallholder said.“Five Knuts? You can sell reality-manipulating fizzy drinks for fiveKnuts the can?” Harry reached into his pouch, said “four Sickles, fourKnuts”, and slapped them down on the counter. “Two dozen cansplease.”“I’ll also take one,” Draco sighed, and started to reach for his pockets.Harry shook his head rapidly. “No, I’ve got this, doesn’t count as afavor either, I want to see if it works for you too.” He took a can fromthe stack now placed on the counter and tossed it to Draco, then startedfeeding his pouch. The pouch’s Widening Lip ate the cans accompaniedby small burping noises, which wasn’t exactly helping to restore Harry’sfaith that he would someday discover a reasonable explanation for allthis.Twenty-two burps later, Harry had the last purchased can in his hand,Draco was looking at him expectantly, and the two of them pulled the ringat the same time.Harry rolled up his scarf to expose his mouth, and they tilted theirheads back and drank the Comed-Tea.It somehow tasted bright green—extra-fizzy and limer than lime.Aside from that, nothing else happened.Harry looked at the stallholder, who was watching them benevolently.All right, if this guy just took advantage of a natural accident to sell me twentyfour cans of nothing, I’m going to applaud his creative entrepreneurial spirit andthen kill him.“It doesn’t always happen immediately,” the stallholder said. “But it’sguaranteed to happen once per can, or your money back.”Harry took another long drink.Once again, nothing happened.Maybe I should just chug the whole thing as fast as possible… and hope mystomach doesn’t explode from all the carbon dioxide, or that I don’t burp whiledrinking it…No, he could afford to be a little patient. But honestly, Harry didn’t seehow this was going to work. You couldn’t go up to someone and say “NowI’m going to surprise you” or “And now I’m going to tell you the punchlineof the joke, and it’ll be really funny.” It ruined the shock value. In Harry’sstate of mental preparedness, Lucius Malfoy could have walked past in aballerina outfit and it wouldn’t have made him do a proper spit-take. Justwhat sort of wacky shenanigan was the universe supposed to cough upnow?“Anyway, let’s sit down,” Harry said. He prepared to swig anotherdrink and started towards the distant seating area, which put him at theright angle to glance back and see the portion of the stall’s newspaperstand that was devoted to a newspaper called The Quibbler, which wasshowing the following headline:Boy-Who-Lived GetsDraco Malfoy Pregnant“Gah!” screamed Draco as bright green liquid sprayed all over himfrom Harry’s direction. Draco turned to Harry with fire in his eyes andgrabbed his own can. “You son of a mudblood! Let’s see how you likebeing spat upon!” Draco took a deliberate swig from the can just as hisown eyes caught sight of the headline.In sheer reflex action, Harry tried to block his face as the spray of liquid flew in his direction. Unfortunately he blocked using the hand containing the Comed-Tea, sending the rest of the green liquid to splash outover his shoulder.Harry stared at the can in his hand even as he went on choking andspluttering and the green colour started to vanish from Draco’s robes.Then he looked up and stared at the newspaper headline.Boy-Who-Lived GetsDraco Malfoy PregnantHarry’s lips opened and said, “buh-bluh-buh-buh…”Too many competing objections, that was the problem. Every timeHarry tried to say “But we’re only eleven!” the objection “But men can’tget pregnant!” demanded first priority and was then run over by “Butthere’s nothing between us, really!”Then Harry looked down at the can in his hand again.He was feeling a deep-seated desire to run away screaming at the topof his lungs until he dropped from lack of oxygen, and the only thing stopping him was that he had once read that outright panic was the sign of atruly important scientific problem.Harry snarled, threw the can violently into a nearby rubbish bin, andstalked back over to the stall. “One copy of The Quibbler, please.” Harrypaid over four more Knuts, retrieved another can of Comed-Tea from hispouch, and then stalked over to the picnic area with the blond-haired boy,who was staring at his own can with an expression of frank admiration.“I take it back,” Draco said, “that was pretty good.”“Hey, Draco, you know what I bet is even better for becoming friendsthan exchanging secrets? Committing murder.”“I have a tutor who says that,” Draco allowed. He reached inside hisrobes and scratched himself with an easy, natural motion. “Who’ve yougot in mind?”Harry slammed The Quibbler down hard on the picnic table. “The guywho came up with this headline.”Draco groaned. “Not a guy. A girl. A ten-year-old girl, can you believeit? She went nuts after her mother died and her father, who owns thisnewspaper, is convinced that she’s a seer, so when he doesn’t know he asksLuna Lovegood and believes anything she says.”Not really thinking about it, Harry pulled the ring on his next can ofComed-Tea and prepared to drink. “Are you kidding me? That’s evenworse than Muggle journalism, which I would have thought was physically impossible.”Draco snarled. “She has some sort of perverse obsession about theMalfoys, too, and her father is politically opposed to us so he prints everyword. As soon as I’m old enough I’m going to rape her.”Green liquid spurted out of Harry’s nostrils, soaking into the scarf stillcovering that area. Comed-Tea and lungs did not mix, and Harry spentthe next few seconds frantically coughing.Draco looked at him sharply. “Something wrong?”It was at this point that Harry came to the sudden realisation that(a) the sounds coming from the rest of the train platform had turned intomore of a blurred white noise at around the same time Draco had reachedinside his robes, and (b) when he had discussed committing murder as abonding method, there had been exactly one person in the conversationwho’d thought they were joking.Right. Because he seemed like such a normal kid. And he is a normal kid,he is just what you’d expect a baseline male child to be like if Darth Vader werehis doting father.“Yes, well,” Harry coughed, oh god how was he going to get out of thisconversational wedge, “I was just surprised at how you were willing todiscuss it so openly, you didn’t seem worried about getting caught or anything.”Draco snorted. “Are you joking? Luna Lovegood’s word against mine?”Holy crap on a holy stick. “There’s no such thing as magical truth detection, I take it?” Or DNA testing… yet.Draco looked around. His eyes narrowed. “That’s right, you don’tknow anything. Look, I’ll explain things to you, I mean the way it reallyworks, just like you were already in Slytherin and asked me the same question. But you’ve got to swear not to say anything about it.”“I swear,” Harry said.“The courts use Veritaserum, but it’s a joke really, you just get yourself Obliviated before you testify and then claim the other person wasMemory-Charmed with a fake memory. Of course if you’re just some normal person, the courts presume in favor of Obliviation, not False MemoryCharms. But the court has discretion, and if I’m involved then it impingeson the honor of a Noble House, so it goes to the Wizengamot, where Father has the votes. After I’m found not guilty the Lovegood family has topay reparations for tarnishing my honor. And they know from the startthat’s how it’ll go, so they’ll just keep their mouths shut.”A cold chill was coming over Harry, a chill that came with instructionsto keep his voice and face normal. Note to self: Overthrow government ofmagical Britain at earliest convenience.Harry coughed again to clear his throat. “Draco, please please pleasedon’t take this the wrong way, my word is my bond, but like you said Icould be in Slytherin and I really want to ask for informational purposes,so what would happen theoretically speaking if I did testify that I’d heardyou plan it?”“Then if I was anyone other than a Malfoy, I’d be in trouble,” Dracoanswered smugly. “Since I am a Malfoy… Father has the votes. And afterwards he’d crush you… well, I guess not easily, since you are the Boy-WhoLived, but Father is pretty good at that sort of thing.” Draco frowned.“’Sides, you talked about murdering her, why weren’t you worried aboutme testifying after she turns up dead?”How, oh how did my day go this wrong? Harry’s mouth was already moving faster than he could think. “That’s when I thought she was older! Idon’t know how it works here, but in Muggle Britain the courts would geta lot more upset about someone killing a child—”“That makes sense,” Draco said, still looking a bit suspicious. “Butanyway, it’s always smarter if it doesn’t go to the Aurors at all. If we’recareful only to do things that Healing Charms can fix, we can just Obliviate her afterwards and then do it all again next week.” Then the blondehaired boy giggled, a youthful high-pitched sound. “Though just imagineher saying she’d been done by Draco Malfoy and the Boy-Who-Lived, noteven Dumbledore would believe her.”I am going to tear apart your pathetic little magical remnant of the Dark Agesinto pieces smaller than its constituent atoms. “Actually, can we hold off onthat? After I found out that headline came from a girl a year youngerthan me, I had a different thought for my revenge.”“Huh? Do tell,” Draco said, and started to take another swig of hisComed-Tea.Harry didn’t know if the enchantment worked more than once percan, but he did know he could avoid the blame, so he was careful to timeit exactly right:“I was thinking someday I’m going to marry that woman.”Draco made a horrid ker-splutching sound and leaked green fluid outthe corners of his mouth like a broken car radiator. “Are you nuts?”“Quite the opposite, I’m so sane it burns like ice.”“You’ve got weirder taste than a Lestrange,” Draco said, sounding halfadmiring about it. “And I suppose you want her all to yourself, huh?”“Yep. I can owe you a favor for it—”Draco waved it off. “Nah, this one’s free.”Harry stared down at the can in his hand, the coldness settling into hisblood. Charming, happy, generous with his favors to his friends, Dracowasn’t a psychopath. That was the sad and awful part, knowing humanpsychology well enough to know that Draco wasn’t a monster. There hadbeen ten thousand societies over the history of the world where this conversation could have happened. No, the world would have been a verydifferent place indeed, if it took an evil mutant to say what Draco had said.It was very simple, very human, it was the default if nothing else intervened. To Draco, his enemies weren’t people.And in the slowed time of this slowed country, here and now as inthe darkness-before-dawn prior to the Age of Reason, the son of a sufficiently powerful noble would simply take for granted that he was abovethe law, at least when it came to some peasant girl. There were places inMuggle-land where it was still the same way, countries where that sortof nobility still existed and still thought like that, or even grimmer landswhere it wasn’t just the nobility. It was like that in every place and timethat didn’t descend directly from the Enlightenment. A line of descent, itseemed, which didn’t quite include magical Britain, for all that there hadbeen cross-cultural contamination of things like ring-pull drinks cans.And if Draco doesn’t change his mind about wanting revenge, and I don’tthrow away my own chance at happiness in life to marry some poor crazy girl,then all I’ve just bought is time, and not too much of it…For one girl. Not for others.I wonder how difficult it would be to just make a list of all the top blood puristsand kill them.They’d tried exactly that during the French Revolution, more or less—make a list of all the enemies of Progress and remove everything above theneck—and it hadn’t worked out well from what Harry recalled. Maybe heneeded to dust off some of those history books his father had bought him,and see if what had gone wrong with the French Revolution was something easy to fix.Harry gazed up at the sky, and at the pale shape of the Moon, visiblethis morning through the cloudless air.So the world is broken and flawed and insane, and cruel and bloody and dark.This is news? You always knew that, anyway…“You’re looking all serious,” Draco said. “Let me guess, your Muggleparents told you that this sort of thing was bad.”Harry nodded, not quite trusting his voice.“Well, like Father says, there may be four houses, but in the end everyone belongs to either Slytherin or Hufflepuff. And frankly, you’re noton the Hufflepuff end. If you decide to side with the Malfoys under thetable… our power and your reputation… you could get away with thingseven I can’t do. Want to try it for a while? See what it’s like?”Aren’t we a clever little serpent. Eleven years old and already coaxing yourprey from hiding…Harry thought, considered, chose his weapon. “Draco, you want toexplain the whole blood purity thing to me? I’m sort of new.”A wide smile crossed Draco’s face. “You really should meet Father andask him, you know, he’s our leader.”“Give me the thirty-second version.”“Okay,” Draco said. He drew in a deep breath, and his voice grewslightly lower, and took on a cadence. “Our powers have grown weaker,generation by generation, as the mudblood taint increases. WhereSalazar and Godric and Rowena and Helga once raised Hogwarts bytheir power, creating the Locket and the Sword and the Diadem andthe Cup, no wizard of these faded days has risen to rival them. We arefading, all fading into Muggles as we interbreed with their spawn andallow our Squibs to live. If the taint is not checked, soon our wands willbreak and all our arts cease, the line of Merlin will end and the blood ofAtlantis fail. Our children will be left scratching at the dirt to survive likethe mere Muggles, and darkness will cover all the world for ever.” Dracotook another swig from his drinks can, looking satisfied; that seemed tobe the whole argument as far as he was concerned.“Persuasive,” Harry said, meaning it descriptively rather than normatively. It was a standard pattern: The Fall from Grace, the need to guardwhat purity remained against contamination, the past sloping upwardsand the future sloping only down. And that pattern also had its counter… “Ihave to correct you on one point of fact, though. Your information aboutthe Muggles is a bit out of date. We aren’t exactly scratching at the dirtanymore.”Draco’s head snapped around. “What? What do you mean, we?”“We. The scientists. The line of Francis Bacon and the blood of theEnlightenment. Muggles didn’t just sit around crying about not havingwands, we have our own powers now, with or without magic. If all yourpowers fail then we will all have lost something very precious, becauseyour magic is the only hint we have as to how the universe must reallywork—but you won’t be left scratching at the ground. Your houses willstill be cool in summer and warm in winter, there will still be doctors andmedicine. Science can keep you alive if magic fails. It’d be a tragedy, butnot literally the end of all the light in the world. Just saying.”Draco had backed up several feet and his face was full of mixed fearand disbelief. “What in the name of Merlin are you talking about, Potter?”“Hey, I listened to your story, won’t you listen to mine?” Clumsy, Harrychided himself, but Draco actually did stop backing off and seem to listen.“Anyway,” Harry said, “I’m saying that you don’t seem to have beenpaying much attention to what goes on in the Muggle world.” Probablybecause the whole wizarding world seemed to regard the rest of Earth asa slum, deserving around as much news coverage as the Financial Timesawarded to the routine agonies of Burundi. “All right. Quick check. Havewizards ever been to the Moon? You know, that thing?” Harry pointed upto that huge and distant globe.“What?” Draco said. It was pretty clear the thought had never occuredto the boy. “Go to the—it’s just a—” His finger pointed at the little palethingy in the sky. “You can’t Apparate to somewhere you’ve never beenand how would anyone get to the Moon in the first place?”“Hold on,” Harry said to Draco, “I’d like to show you a book I broughtwith me, I think I remember what box it’s in.” And Harry stood up andkneeled down and yanked out the stairs to the cavern level of his trunk,then tore down the stairs and heaved a box off another box, coming perilously close to treating his books with disrespect, and snatched off thebox cover and quickly but carefully pried out a stack of books—(Harry had inherited the nigh-magical Verres ability to rememberwhere all his books were, even after seeing them just once, which wasrather mysterious considering the lack of any genetic connection.)And Harry raced back up the stairs and shoved the staircase back intothe trunk with his heel, and, panting, turned the pages of the book untilhe found the picture he wanted to show to Draco.The one with the white, dry, cratered land, and the suited people, andthe blue-white globe hanging over it all.That picture.The picture, if only one picture in all the world were to survive.“That,” Harry said, his voice trembling because he couldn’t quite keepthe pride out, “is what the Earth looks like from the Moon.”Draco slowly leaned over. There was a strange expression on hisyoung face. “If that’s a real picture, why isn’t it moving?”Moving? Oh. “Muggles can do moving pictures but they need a biggerbox to show it, they can’t fit them onto single book pages yet.”Draco’s finger moved to one of the suits. “What are those?” His voicestarting to waver.“Those are human beings. They are wearing suits that cover theirwhole bodies to give them air, because there is no air on the Moon.”“That’s impossible,” Draco whispered. There was terror in his eyes,and utter confusion. “No Muggle could ever do that. How…”Harry took back the book, flipped the pages until he found what hesaw. “This is a rocket going up. The fire pushes it higher and higher, untilit gets to the Moon.” Flipped pages again. “This is a rocket on the ground.That tiny speck next to it is a person.” Draco gasped. “Going to the Mooncost the equivalent of… probably around a thousand million Galleons.”Draco choked. “And it took the efforts of… probably more people thanlive in all of magical Britain.” And when they arrived, they left a plaque thatsaid, ‘We came in peace, for all mankind.’ Though you’re not yet ready to hearthose words, Draco Malfoy…“You’re telling the truth,” Draco said slowly. “You wouldn’t fake awhole book just for this—and I can hear it in your voice. But… but…”“How, without wands or magic? It’s a long story, Draco. Sciencedoesn’t work by waving wands and chanting spells, it works by knowing how the universe works on such a deep level that you know exactlywhat to do in order to make the universe do what you want. If magic islike casting Imperio on someone to make them do what you want, thenscience is like knowing them so well that you can convince them it wastheir own idea all along. It’s a lot more difficult than waving a wand, butit works when wands fail, just like if the Imperius failed you could still trypersuading a person. And Science builds from generation to generation.You have to really know what you’re doing to do science—and when youreally understand something, you can explain it to someone else. Thegreatest scientists of one century ago, the brightest names that are stillspoken with reverence, their powers are as nothing to the greatest scientists of today. There is no equivalent in science of your lost arts thatraised Hogwarts. In science our powers wax by the year. And we arebeginning to understand and unravel the secrets of life and inheritance.We’ll be able to look at the very blood of which you spoke, and see whatmakes you a wizard, and in one or two more generations, we’ll be ableto persuade that blood to make all your children powerful wizards too.So you see, your problem isn’t nearly as bad as it looks, because in a fewmore decades, science will be able to solve it for you.”“But…” Draco said. His voice was trembling. “If Muggles have thatkind of power… then… what are we?”“No, Draco, that’s not it, don’t you see? Science taps the power of human understanding to look at the world and figure out how it works. Itcan’t fail without humanity itself failing. Your magic could turn off, andyou would hate that, but you would still be you. You would still be aliveto regret it. But because science rests upon my human intelligence, it isthe power that cannot be removed from me without removing me. Evenif the laws of the universe change on me, so that all my knowledge is void,I’ll just figure out the new laws, as has been done before. It’s not a Mugglething, it’s a human thing, it just refines and trains the power you use everytime you look at something you don’t understand and ask ‘Why?’ You’reof Slytherin, Draco, don’t you see the implication?”Draco looked up from the book to Harry. His face showed dawningunderstanding. “Wizards can learn to use this power.”Very carefully, now… the bait is set, now the hook… “If you can learnto think of yourself as a human instead of a wizard then you can train andrefine your powers as a human.”And if that instruction wasn’t in every science curriculum, Dracodidn’t need to know it, did he?Draco’s eyes were now thoughtful. “You’ve… already done this?”“To some extent,” Harry allowed. “My training isn’t complete. Not ateleven. But—my father also bought me tutors, you see.” Sure, they’d beenstarving grad students, and it had only been because Harry slept on a 26hour cycle, but leave all that aside for now…Slowly, Draco nodded. “You think you can master both arts, add thepowers together, and…” Draco stared at Harry. “Make yourself Lord ofthe two worlds?”Harry gave an evil laugh, it just seemed to come naturally at that point.“You have to realise, Draco, that the whole world you know, all of magicalBritain, is just one square on a much larger gameboard. The gameboardthat includes places like the Moon, and the stars in the night sky, whichare lights just like the Sun only unimaginably far away, and things likegalaxies that are vastly huger than the Earth and Sun, things so large thatonly scientists can see them and you don’t even know they exist. But Ireally am Ravenclaw, you know, not Slytherin. I don’t want to rule theuniverse. I just think it could be more sensibly organised.”There was awe on Draco’s face. “Why are you telling me this?”“Oh… there aren’t many people who know how to do true science—understanding something for the very first time, even if it confuses thehell out of you. Help would be helpful.”Draco stared at Harry with his mouth open.“But make no mistake, Draco, true science really isn’t like magic, youcan’t just do it and walk away unchanged like learning how to say thewords of a new spell. The power comes with a cost, a cost so high thatmost people refuse to pay it.”Draco nodded at this as though, finally, he’d heard something hecould understand. “And that cost?”“Learning to admit you’re wrong.”“Um,” Draco said after the dramatic pause had stretched on for awhile. “You going to explain that?”“Trying to figure out how something works on that deep level, the firstninety-nine explanations you come up with are wrong. The hundredth isright. So you have to learn how to admit you’re wrong, over and over andover again. It doesn’t sound like much, but it’s so hard that most peoplecan’t do science. Always questioning yourself, always taking another lookat things you’ve always taken for granted,” like having a Snitch in Quidditch, “and every time you change your mind, you change yourself. ButI’m getting way ahead of myself here. Way ahead of myself. I just wantyou to know… I’m offering to share some of my knowledge. If you want.There’s just one condition.”“Uh huh,” Draco said. “You know, Father says that when someone saysthat to you, it is never a good sign, ever.”Harry nodded. “Now, don’t mistake me and think that I’m trying todrive a wedge between you and your father. It’s not about that. It’s justabout me wanting to deal with someone my own age, rather than havingthis be between me and Lucius. I think your father would be okay withthat too, he knows you have to grow up sometime. But your moves in ourgame have to be your own. That’s my condition—that I’m dealing withyou, Draco, not your father.”“I’ve got to go,” Draco said. He stood up. “I’ve got to go off and thinkabout this.”“Take your time,” Harry said.The sounds of the train platform changed from blurs into murmursas Draco wandered off.Harry slowly exhaled the air he’d been holding in without quite realising it, and then looked at the watch on his wrist, a simple mechanicalmodel that his father had bought him in hope it would work in magic’spresence. The second-hand was still ticking, and if the minute hand wasright, then it wasn’t quite eleven just yet. He probably ought to get onthe train soon and start looking for whatsherface, but it seemed worthtaking a few minutes first to do some breathing exercises and see if hisblood warmed up again.But when Harry looked up from his watch, he saw two figures approaching, looking utterly ridiculous with their faces cloaked by winterscarves.“Hello, Mr. Bronze,” said one of the masked figures. “Can we interestyou in joining the Order of Chaos?”Aftermath:Not too long after that, when all that day’s fuss had finally subsided,Draco was bent over a desk with quill in hand. He had a private roomin the Slytherin dungeons, with its own desk and its own fire—sadly noteven he rated a connection to the Floo system, but at least Slytherin didn’tbuy into that utter nonsense about making everyone sleep in dorms. Thereweren’t many private rooms, you had to be the very best within the Houseof the better sort, but that could be taken for granted with the House ofMalfoy.Dear Father, Draco wrote.And then he stopped.Ink slowly dripped from his quill, staining the parchment near thewords.Draco wasn’t stupid. He was young, but his tutors had trained himwell. Draco knew that Potter probably felt a lot more sympathy towardsDumbledore’s faction than Potter was letting on… though Draco did thinkPotter could be tempted. But it was crystal clear that Potter was trying totempt Draco just as Draco was trying to tempt him.And it was also clear that Potter was brilliant, and a whole lot morethan just slightly mad, and playing a vast game that Potter himself mostlydidn’t understand, improvised at top speed with the subtlety of a rampaging nundu. But Potter had managed to choose a tactic that Draco couldn’tjust walk away from. He had offered Draco a part of his own power, gambling that Draco couldn’t use it without becoming more like him. His father had called this an advanced technique, and had warned Draco thatit often didn’t work.Draco knew he hadn’t understood everything that had happened…but Potter had offered him the chance to play and right now it was his.And if he blurted the whole thing out, it would become Father’s.In the end it was as simple as that. The lesser techniques require theunawareness of the target, or at least their uncertainty. Flattery has to beplausibly disguised as admiration. (“You should have been in Slytherin”is an old classic, highly effective on a certain type of person who isn’t expecting it, and if it works you can repeat it.) But when you find someone’sultimate lever it doesn’t matter if they know you know. Potter, in his madrush, had guessed a key to Draco’s soul. And if Draco knew that Potterknew it—even if it had been an obvious sort of guess—that didn’t changeanything.So now, for the first time in his life, he had real secrets to keep. Hewas playing his own game. There was an obscure pain to it, but he knewthat Father would be proud, and that made it all right.Leaving the ink drippings in place—there was a message there, andone that his father would understand, for they had played the game ofsubtleties more than once—Draco wrote out the one question that reallyhad gnawed at him about the whole affair, the part that it seemed he oughtto understand, but he didn’t, not at all.Dear Father:Suppose I told you that I met a student at Hogwarts, not already part of ourcircle of acquaintances, who called you a ‘flawless instrument of death’ and saidthat I was your ‘one weak point’. What would you say about him?It didn’t take long after that for the family owl to bring the reply.My beloved son:I would say that you had been so fortunate as to meet someone who enjoys theintimate confidence of our friend and valuable ally, Severus Snape.Draco stared at the letter for a while, and finally threw it into the fire.o one had asked for help, that was the problem. They’d just goneN around talking, eating, or staring into the air while their parentsexchanged gossip. For whatever odd reason, no one had been sittingdown reading a book, which meant she couldn’t just sit down next tothem and take out her own book. And even when she’d boldly taken theinitiative by sitting down and continuing her third read-through of Hogwarts: A History, no one had seemed inclined to sit down next to her.Aside from helping people with their homework, or anything else theyneeded, she really didn’t know how to meet people. She didn’t feel likeshe was a shy person. She thought of herself as a take-charge sort of girl.And yet, somehow, if there wasn’t some request along the lines of “I can’tremember how to do long division” then it was just too awkward to go upto someone and say… what? She’d never been able to figure out what. Andthere didn’t seem to be a standard information sheet, which was ridiculous. The whole business of meeting people had never seemed sensibleto her. Why did she have to take all the responsibility herself when therewere two people involved? Why didn’t adults ever help? She wished someother girl would just walk up to her and say, “Hermione, the teacher toldme to be friends with you.”But let it be quite clear that Hermione Granger, sitting alone on thefirst day of school in one of the few compartments that had been empty,in the last carriage of the train, with the compartment door left open justin case anyone for any reason wanted to talk to her, was not sad, lonely,gloomy, depressed, despairing, or obsessing about her problems. Shewas, rather, rereading Hogwarts: A History for the third time and quiteenjoying it, with only a faint tinge of annoyance in the back of her mindat the general unreasonableness of the world.There was the sound of an inter-train door opening, and then footsteps and an odd slithering sound coming down the hallway of the train.Hermione laid aside Hogwarts: A History and stood up and stuck her headoutside—just in case someone needed help—and saw a young boy in awizard’s dress robes, probably first or second year going by his height,and looking quite silly with a scarf wrapped around his head. A smalltrunk stood on the floor next to him. Even as she saw him, he knockedon the door of another, closed compartment, and he said in a voice onlyslightly muffled by the scarf, “Excuse me, can I ask a quick question?”She didn’t hear the answer from inside the compartment, but afterthe boy opened the door, she did think she heard him say—unless she’dsomehow misheard—“Does anyone here know the six quarks or where Ican find a first-year girl named Hermione Granger?”After the boy had closed that compartment door, Hermione said, “CanI help you with something?”The scarfed face turned to look at her, and the voice said, “Not unlessyou can name the six quarks or tell me where to find Hermione Granger.”“Up, down, strange, charm, truth, beauty, and why are you lookingfor her?”It was hard to tell from this distance, but she thought she saw the boygrin widely under his scarf. “Ah, so you’re a first-year girl named Hermione Granger,” said that young, muffled voice. “On the train to Hogwarts,no less.” The boy started to walk towards her and her compartment, andhis trunk slithered along after him. “Technically, all I needed to do waslook for you, but it seems likely that I’m meant to talk to you or invite youto join my party or get a key magical item from you or find out that Hogwarts was built over the ruins of an ancient temple or something. PC orNPC, that is the question?”Hermione opened her mouth to reply to this, but then she couldn’tthink of any possible reply to… whatever it was she’d just heard, even asthe boy walked over to her, looked inside the compartment, nodded withsatisfaction, and sat down on the bench across from her own. His trunkscurried in after him, grew to three times its former diameter and snuggled up next to her own in an oddly disturbing fashion.“Please, have a seat,” said the boy, “and do please close the door behindyou, if you would. Don’t worry, I don’t bite anyone who doesn’t bite mefirst.” He was already unwinding the scarf from around his head.The imputation that this boy thought she was scared of him made herhand send the door sliding shut, jamming it into the wall with unnecessary force. She spun around and saw a young face with bright, laughing green eyes, and an angry red-dark scar set into his forehead that reminded her of something in the back of her mind but right now she hadmore important things to think about. “I didn’t say I was Hermione Granger!”“I didn’t say you said you were Hermione Granger, I just said youwere Hermione Granger. If you’re asking how I know, it’s because Iknow everything. Good evening ladies and gentlemen, my name isHarry James Potter-Evans-Verres or Harry Potter for short, I know thatprobably doesn’t mean anything to you for a change—”Hermione’s mind finally made the connection. The scar on his forehead, the shape of a lightning bolt. “Harry Potter! You’re in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Eventsof the Twentieth Century.” It was actually the very first time in her wholelife that she’d met someone from inside a book, and it was a rather oddfeeling.The boy blinked three times. “I’m in books? Wait, of course I’m inbooks… what a strange thought.”“Goodness, didn’t you know?” said Hermione. “I’d have found outeverything I could if it was me.”The boy spoke rather dryly. “Miss Granger, it has been less than 72hours since I went to Diagon Alley and discovered my claim to fame. Ihave spent the last two days buying science books. Believe me, I intendto find out everything I can.” The boy hesitated. “What do the books sayabout me?”Hermione Granger’s mind flashed back, she hadn’t realised she wouldbe tested on those books so she’d read them only once, but it was just amonth ago so the material was still fresh in her mind. “You’re the onlyone who’s survived the Killing Curse so you’re called the Boy-Who-Lived.You were born to James Potter and Lily Potter formerly Lily Evans on the31st of July 1980. On the 31st of October 1981 the Dark Lord He-Who-MustNot-Be-Named though I don’t know why not attacked your home. Youwere found alive with the scar on your forehead in the ruins of your parents’ house near the burnt remains of You-Know-Who’s body. Chief Warlock Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore sent you off somewhere,no one knows where. The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts claims that you survived because of your mother’s love and that your scar contains all of theDark Lord’s magical power and that the centaurs fear you, but Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century doesn’t mention anything like thatand Modern Magical History warns that there are lots of crackpot theoriesabout you.”The boy’s mouth was hanging open. “Were you told to wait for HarryPotter on the train to Hogwarts, or something like that?”“No,” Hermione said. “Who told you about me?”“Professor McGonagall and I believe I see why. Do you have an eideticmemory, Hermione?”Hermione shook her head. “It’s not photographic, I’ve always wishedit was but I had to read my school books five times over to memorize themall.”“Really,” the boy said in a slightly strangled voice. “I hope you don’tmind if I test that—it’s not that I don’t believe you, but as the saying goes,‘Trust, but verify’. No point in wondering when I can just do the experiment.”Hermione smiled, rather smugly. She so loved tests. “Go ahead.”The boy stuck a hand into a pouch at his side and said “Magical Draftsand Potions by Arsenius Jigger”. When he withdrew his hand it was holding the book he’d named.Instantly Hermione wanted one of those pouches more than she’dever wanted anything.The boy opened the book to somewhere in the middle and lookeddown. “If you were making oil of sharpness—”“I can see that page from here, you know!”100 *The boy tilted the book so that she couldn’t see it any more, and flippedthe pages again. “If you were brewing a potion of spider climbing, whatwould be the next ingredient you added after the Acromantula silk?”“After dropping in the silk, wait until the potion has turned exactlythe shade of the cloudless dawn sky, 8 degrees from the horizon and 8minutes before the tip of the sun first becomes visible. Stir eight timeswiddershins and once deasil, and then add eight drams of unicorn bogies.”The boy shut the book with a sharp snap and put the book back intohis pouch, which swallowed it with a small burping noise. “Well well wellwell well well. I should like to make you a proposition, Miss Granger.”“A proposition?” Hermione said suspiciously. Girls weren’t supposedto listen to those.It was also at this point that Hermione realised the other thing—well,one of the things—which was odd about the boy. Apparently people whowere in books actually sounded like a book when they talked. This was quitethe surprising discovery.The boy reached into his pouch and said, “can of pop”, retrieving abright green cylinder. He held it out to her and said, “Can I offer yousomething to drink?”Hermione politely accepted the fizzy drink. In fact she was feelingsort of thirsty by now. “Thank you very much,” Hermione said as shepopped the top. “Was that your proposition?”The boy coughed. “No,” he said. Just as Hermione started to drink, hesaid, “I’d like you to help me take over the universe.”Hermione finished her drink and lowered the can. “No thank you, I’mnot evil.”The boy looked at her in surprise, as though he’d been expecting someother answer. “Well, I was speaking a bit rhetorically,” he said. “In thesense of the Baconian project, you know, not political power. ‘The effecting of all things possible’ and so on. I want to conduct experimental studies of spells, figure out the underlying laws, bring magic into thedomain of science, merge the wizarding and Muggle worlds, raise the entire planet’s standard of living, move humanity centuries ahead, discoverthe secret of immortality, colonize the Solar System, explore the galaxy,and most importantly, figure out what the heck is really going on herebecause all of this is blatantly impossible.”That sounded a bit more interesting. “And?”The boy stared at her incredulously. “And? That’s not enough?”“And what do you want from me?” said Hermione.“I want you to help me do the research, of course. With your encyclopedic memory added to my intelligence and rationality, we’ll have theBaconian project finished in no time, where by ‘no time’ I mean probablyat least thirty-five years.”Hermione was beginning to find this boy annoying. “I haven’t seenyou do anything intelligent. Maybe I’ll let you help me with my research.”There was a certain silence in the compartment.“So you’re asking me to demonstrate my intelligence, then,” said theboy after a long pause.Hermione nodded.“I warn you that challenging my ingenuity is a dangerous project, andtends to make your life a lot more surreal.”“I’m not impressed yet,” Hermione said. Unnoticed, the green drinkonce again rose to her lips.“Well, maybe this will impress you,” the boy said. He leaned forwardand looked at her intensely. “I’ve already done a bit of experimenting andI found out that I don’t need the wand, I can make anything I want happen just by snapping my fingers.”It came just as Hermione was in the middle of swallowing, and shechoked and coughed and expelled the bright green fluid.Onto her brand new, never-worn witch’s robes, on the very first dayof school.Hermione actually screamed. It was a high-pitched sound thatsounded like an air raid siren in the closed compartment. “Eek! Myclothes!”“Don’t panic!” said the boy. “I can fix it for you. Just watch!” He raiseda hand and snapped his fingers.“You’ll—” Then she looked down at herself.The green fluid was still there, but even as she watched, it started tovanish and fade and within just a few moments, it was like she’d neverspilled anything at herself.Hermione stared at the boy, who was wearing a rather smug sort ofsmile.Wordless wandless magic! At his age? When he’d only gotten theschoolbooks three days ago?Then she remembered what she’d read, and she gasped and flinchedback from him. All the Dark Lord’s magical power! In his scar!She rose hastily to her feet. “I, I, I need to go the toilet, wait here allright—” she had to find a grownup she had to tell them—The boy’s smile faded. “It was just a trick, Hermione. I’m sorry, Ididn’t mean to scare you.”Her hand halted on the door handle. “A trick?”“Yes,” said the boy. “You asked me to demonstrate my intelligence.So I did something apparently impossible, which is always a good way toshow off. I can’t really do anything just by snapping my fingers.” The boypaused. “At least I don’t think I can, I’ve never actually tested it experimentally.” The boy raised his hand and snapped his fingers again. “Nope,no banana.”Hermione was as confused as she’d ever been in her life.The boy was now smiling again at the look on her face. “I did warnyou that challenging my ingenuity tends to make your life surreal. Doremember this the next time I warn you about something.”“But, but,” Hermione stammered. “What did you do, then?”The boy’s gaze took on a measuring, weighing quality that she’d neverseen before from someone her own age. “You think you have what it takesto be a scientist in your own right, with or without my help? Then let’s seehow you investigate a confusing phenomenon.”“I…” Hermione’s mind went blank for a moment. She loved tests butshe’d never had a test like this before. Frantically, she tried to cast backfor anything she’d read about what scientists were supposed to do. Hermind skipped gears, ground against itself, and spat back the instructionsfor doing a science investigation project:103 *Step 1: Form a hypothesis.Step 2: Do an experiment to test your hypothesis.Step 3: Measure the results.Step 4: Make a cardboard poster.Step 1 was to form a hypothesis. That meant, try to think of somethingthat could have happened just now. “All right. My hypothesis is that youcast a Charm on my robes to make anything spilled on it vanish.”“All right,” said the boy, “is that your answer?”The shock was wearing off, and Hermione’s mind was starting towork properly. “Wait, that can’t be right. I didn’t see you touch yourwand or say any spells so how could you have cast a Charm?”The boy waited, his face neutral.“But suppose all the robes come from the store with a Charm alreadyon them to keep them clean, which would be a useful sort of Charm forthem to have. You found that out by spilling something on yourself earlier.”Now the boy’s eyebrows lifted. “Is that your answer?”“No, I haven’t done Step 2, ‘Do an experiment to test your hypothesis.’”The boy closed his mouth again, and began to smile.Hermione looked at the drinks can, which she’d automatically putinto the cupholder at the window. She took it up and peered inside, andfound that it was around one-third full.“Well,” said Hermione, “the experiment I want to do is to pour it onmy robes and see what happens, and my prediction is that the stain willdisappear. Only if it doesn’t work, my robes will be stained, and I don’twant that.”“Do it to mine,” said the boy, “that way you don’t have to worry aboutyour robes getting stained.”“But—” Hermione said. There was something wrong with that thinking but she didn’t know how to say it exactly.“I have spare robes in my trunk,” said the boy.“But there’s nowhere for you to change,” Hermione objected. Thenshe thought better of it. “Though I suppose I could leave and close thedoor—”“I have somewhere to change in my trunk, too.”104 *Hermione looked at his trunk, which, she was beginning to suspect,was rather more special than her own.“All right,” Hermione said, “since you say so,” and she rather gingerlypoured a bit of green pop onto a corner of the boy’s robes. Then she staredat it, trying to remember how long the original fluid had taken to disappear…And the green stain vanished!Hermione let out a sigh of relief, not least because this meant shewasn’t dealing with all of the Dark Lord’s magical power.Well, Step 3 was measuring the results, but in this case that was justseeing that the stain had vanished. And she supposed she could probablyskip Step 4, about the cardboard poster. “My answer is that the robes areCharmed to keep themselves clean.”“Not quite,” said the boy.Hermione felt a stab of disappointment. She really wished shewouldn’t have felt that way, the boy wasn’t a teacher, but it was still a testand she’d gotten a question wrong and that always felt like a little punchin the stomach.(It said almost everything you needed to know about Hermione Granger that she had never let that stop her, or even let it interfere with her loveof being tested.)“The sad thing is,” said the boy, “you probably did everything the booktold you to do. You made a prediction that would distinguish between therobe being charmed and not charmed, and you tested it, and rejected thenull hypothesis that the robe was not charmed. But unless you read thevery, very best sort of books, they won’t quite teach you how to do scienceproperly. Well enough to really get the right answer, I mean, and not justchurn out another publication like Dad always complains about. So letme try to explain—without giving away the answer—what you did wrongthis time, and I’ll give you another chance.”She was starting to resent the boy’s oh-so-superior tone when he wasjust another eleven-year-old like her, but that was secondary to findingout what she’d done wrong. “All right.”The boy’s expression grew more intense. “This is a game based on afamous experiment called the 2-4-6 task, and this is how it works. I havea rule—known to me, but not to you—which fits some triplets of threenumbers, but not others. 2-4-6 is one example of a triplet which fits therule. In fact… let me write down the rule, just so you know it’s a fixedrule, and fold it up and give it to you. Please don’t look, since I infer fromearlier that you can read upside-down.”The boy said “paper” and “mechanical pencil” to his pouch, and sheshut her eyes tightly while he wrote.“There,” said the boy, and he was holding a tightly folded piece of paper. “Put this in your pocket,” and she did.“Now the way this game works,” said the boy, “is that you give me atriplet of three numbers, and I’ll tell you ‘Yes’ if the three numbers arean instance of the rule, and ‘No’ if they’re not. I am Nature, the rule isone of my laws, and you are investigating me. You already know that2-4-6 gets a ‘Yes’. When you’ve performed all the further experimentaltests you want—asked me as many triplets as you feel necessary—youstop and guess the rule, and then you can unfold the sheet of paper andsee how you did. Do you understand the game?”“Of course I do,” said Hermione.“Go.”“4–6–8” said Hermione.“Yes,” said the boy.“10–12–14”, said Hermione.“Yes,” said the boy.Hermione tried to cast her mind a little further afield, since it seemedlike she’d already done all the testing she needed, and yet it couldn’t bethat easy, could it?“1–3–5.”“Yes.”“Minus 3, minus 1, plus 1.”“Yes.”Hermione couldn’t think of anything else to do. “The rule is that thenumbers have to increase by two each time.”“Now suppose I tell you,” said the boy, “that this test is harder than itlooks, and that only 20% of grownups get it right.”Hermione frowned. What had she missed? Then, suddenly, shethought of a test she still needed to do.“2–5–8!” she said triumphantly.“Yes.”“10–20–30!”“Yes.”“The real answer is that the numbers have to go up by the same amounteach time. It doesn’t have to be 2.”“Very well,” said the boy, “take the paper out and see how you did.”Hermione took the paper out of her pocket and unfolded it.Three real numbers in increasing order, lowest to highest.Hermione’s jaw dropped. She had the distinct feeling of somethingterribly unfair having been done to her, that the boy was a dirty rottencheating liar, but when she cast her mind back she couldn’t think of anywrong responses that he’d given.“What you’ve just discovered is called ‘positive bias’,” said the boy.“You had a rule in your mind, and you kept on thinking of triplets thatshould make the rule say ‘Yes’. But you didn’t try to test any triplets thatshould make the rule say ‘No’. In fact you didn’t get a single ‘No’, so ‘anythree numbers’ could have just as easily been the rule. It’s sort of likehow people imagine experiments that could confirm their hypothesesinstead of trying to imagine experiments that could falsify them—that’snot quite exactly the same mistake but it’s close. You have to learn tolook on the negative side of things, stare into the darkness. When thisexperiment is performed, only 20% of grownups get the answer right.And many of the others invent fantastically complicated hypotheses andput great confidence in their wrong answers since they’ve done so manyexperiments and everything came out like they expected.”“Now,” said the boy, “do you want to take another shot at the originalproblem?”His eyes were quite intent now, as though this were the real test.Hermione shut her eyes and tried to concentrate. She was sweatingunderneath her robes. She had an odd feeling that this was the hardestshe’d ever been asked to think on a test or maybe even the first time she’dever been asked to think on a test.What other experiment could she do? She had a Chocolate Frog, couldshe try to rub some of that on the robes and see if it vanished? But thatstill didn’t seem like the kind of twisty negative thinking the boy was asking for. Like she was still asking for a ‘Yes’ if the Chocolate Frog staindisappeared, rather than asking for a ‘No’.So… on her hypothesis… when should the pop… not vanish?“I have an experiment to do,” Hermione said. “I want to pour somepop on the floor, and see if it doesn’t vanish. Do you have some paper towels in your pouch, so I can mop up the spill if this doesn’t work?”“I have napkins,” said the boy. His face still looked neutral.Hermione took the can, and poured a small bit of pop onto the floor.A few seconds later, it vanished.Then the realisation hit her and she felt like kicking herself. “Ofcourse! You gave me that can! It’s not the robe that’s enchanted, it wasthe pop all along!”The boy stood up and bowed to her solemnly. He was grinning widelynow. “Then… may I help you with your research, Hermione Granger?”“I, ah…” Hermione was still feeling the rush of euphoria, but shewasn’t quite sure about how to answer that.They were interrupted by a weak, tentative, faint, rather reluctantknocking at the door.The boy turned and looked out the window, and said, “I’m not wearingmy scarf, so can you get that?”It was at this point that Hermione realised why the boy—no, the BoyWho-Lived, Harry Potter—had been wearing the scarf over his head inthe first place, and felt a little silly for not realising it earlier. It was actually sort of odd, since she would have thought Harry Potter would proudlydisplay himself to the world; and the thought occurred to her that hemight actually be shyer than he seemed.When Hermione pulled the door open, she was greeted by a tremblingyoung boy who looked exactly like he knocked.“Excuse me,” said the boy in a tiny voice, “I’m Neville Longbottom. I’mlooking for my pet toad, I, I can’t seem to find it anywhere on this carriage… have you seen my toad?”108 *“No,” Hermione said, and then her helpfulness kicked in full throttle.“Have you checked all the other compartments?”“Yes,” whispered the boy.“Then we’ll just have to check all the other carriages,” Hermione saidbriskly. “I’ll help you. My name is Hermione Granger, by the way.”The boy looked like he might faint with gratitude.“Hold on,” came the voice of the other boy—Harry Potter. “I’m not surethat’s the best way to do it.”At this Neville looked like he might cry, and Hermione swung around,angered. If Harry Potter was the sort of person who’d abandon a little boyjust because he didn’t want to be interrupted… “What? Why not?”“Well,” said Harry Potter, “It’s going to take a while to check the wholetrain by hand, and we might miss the toad anyway, and if we didn’t findit by the time we’re at Hogwarts, he’d be in trouble. So what would makea lot more sense is if he went directly to the front carriage, where the prefects are, and asked a prefect for help. That was the first thing I did whenI was looking for you, Hermione, although they didn’t actually know. Butthey might have spells or magic items that would make it a lot easier tofind a toad. We’re only first-years.”That… did make a lot of sense.“Do you think you can make it to the prefects’ carriage on your own?”asked Harry Potter. “I’ve sort of got reasons for not wanting to show myface too much.”Suddenly Neville gasped and took a step back. “I remember that voice!You’re one of the Lords of Chaos! You’re the one who gave me chocolate!”What? What what what?Harry Potter turned his head from the window and rose dramatically.“I never!” he said, voice full of indignation. “Do I look like the sort of villainwho would give sweets to a child?”Neville’s eyes widened. “You’re Harry Potter? The Harry Potter? You?”“No, just a Harry Potter, there are three of me on this train—”Neville gave a small shriek and ran away. There was a brief patteringof frantic footsteps and then the sound of a carriage door opening andclosing.109 *Hermione sat down hard on her bench. Harry Potter closed the doorand then sat down next to her.“Can you please explain to me what’s going on?” Hermione said in aweak voice. She wondered if hanging around Harry Potter meant alwaysbeing this confused.“Oh, well, what happened was that Fred and George and I saw thispoor small boy at the train station—the woman next to him had goneaway for a bit, and he was looking really frightened, like he was sure hewas about to be attacked by Death Eaters or something. Now, there’s asaying that the fear is often worse than the thing itself, so it occurred tome that this was a lad who could actually benefit from seeing his worstnightmare come true and that it wasn’t so bad as he feared—”Hermione sat there with her mouth wide open.“—and Fred and George came up with this spell to make the scarvesover our faces darken and blur, like we were undead kings and those wereour grave shrouds—”She didn’t like at all where this was going.“—and after we were done giving him all the sweets I’d bought, wewere like, ‘Let’s give him some money! Ha ha ha! Have some Knuts, boy!Have a silver Sickle!’ and dancing around him and laughing evilly andso on. I think there were some people in the crowd who wanted to interfere at first, but bystander apathy held them off at least until they sawwhat we were doing, and then I think they were all too confused to do anything. Finally he said in this tiny little whisper ‘go away’ so the three ofus all screamed and ran off, shrieking something about the light burningus. Hopefully he won’t be as scared of being bullied in the future. That’scalled desensitisation therapy, by the way.”Okay, she hadn’t guessed right about where this was going.The burning fire of indignation that was one of Hermione’s primaryengines sputtered into life, even though part of her did sort of see whatthey’d been trying to do. “That’s awful! You’re awful! That poor boy! Whatyou did was mean!”“I think the word you’re looking for is enjoyable, and in any case you’reasking the wrong question. The question is, did it do more good thanharm, or more harm than good? If you have any arguments to contributeto that question I’m glad to hear them, but I won’t entertain any othercriticisms until that one is settled. I certainly agree that what I did looksall terrible and bullying and mean, since it involves a scared little boy andso on, but that’s hardly the key issue now is it? That’s called consequentialism, by the way, it means that whether an act is right or wrong isn’t determined by whether it looks bad, or mean, or anything like that, the onlyquestion is how it will turn out in the end—what are the consequences.”Hermione opened her mouth to say something utterly searing but unfortunately she seemed to have neglected the part where she thought ofsomething to say before opening her mouth. All she could come up withwas, “What if he has nightmares?”“Honestly, I don’t think he needed our help to have nightmares, andif he has nightmares about this instead, then it’ll be nightmares involvinghorrible monsters who give you chocolate and that was sort of the wholepoint.”Hermione’s brain kept hiccoughing in confusion every time she triedto get properly angry. “Is your life always this peculiar?” she said at last.Harry Potter’s face gleamed with pride. “I make it that peculiar. You’relooking at the product of a lot of hard work and elbow grease.”“So…” Hermione said, and trailed off awkwardly.“So,” Harry Potter said, “how much science do you know exactly? Ican do calculus and I know some Bayesian probability theory and decision theory and a lot of cognitive science, and I’ve read The Feynman Lectures (or volume 1 anyway) and Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics andBiases and Language in Thought and Action and Influence: Science and Practiceand Rational Choice in an Uncertain World and Godel, Escher, Bach and A StepFarther Out and—”The ensuing quiz and counter-quiz went on for several minutes before being interrupted by another timid knock at the door. “Come in,”she and Harry Potter said at almost the same time, and it slid back to reveal Neville Longbottom.Neville was actually crying now. “I went to the front carriage andfound a p-prefect but he t-told me that prefects weren’t to be botheredover little things like m-missing toads.”The Boy-Who-Lived’s face changed. His lips set in a thin line. Hisvoice, when he spoke, was cold and grim. “What were his colours? Greenand silver?”“N-no, his badge was r-red and gold.”“Red and gold!” burst out Hermione. “But those are Gryffindor’scolours!”Harry Potter hissed at that, a frightening sort of sound that could havecome from a live snake and made both her and Neville flinch. “I suppose,”Harry Potter spat, “that finding some first-year’s toad isn’t heroic enoughto be worthy of a Gryffindor prefect. Come on, Neville, I’ll come with youthis time, we’ll see if the Boy-Who-Lived gets more attention. First we’llfind a prefect who ought to know a spell, and if that doesn’t work, we’llfind a prefect who isn’t afraid of getting their hands dirty, and if thatdoesn’t work, I’ll start recruiting my fans and if we have to we’ll take apartthe whole train screw by screw.”The Boy-Who-Lived stood up and grabbed Neville’s hand in his, andHermione realised with a sudden brain hiccough that they were nearlythe same size, even though some part of her had insisted that Harry Potter was a foot taller than that, and Neville at least six inches shorter.“Stay!” Harry Potter snapped at her—no, wait, at his trunk—and heclosed the door behind him firmly as he left.She probably should have gone with them, but in just a brief momentHarry Potter had turned so scary that she was actually rather glad shehadn’t thought to suggest it.Hermione’s mind was now so jumbled that she didn’t even think shecould properly read “History: A Hogwarts”. She felt as if she’d just beenrun over by a steamroller and turned into a pancake. She wasn’t sure whatshe was thinking or what she was feeling or why. She just sat by the window and stared at the moving scenery.Well, she did at least know why she was feeling a little sad inside.Maybe Gryffindor wasn’t as wonderful as she had thought.bbott, Hannah!”Pause.“Bones, Susan!”Pause.“Boot, Terry!”Pause.Harry glanced over briefly at his new House-mate, more to get a quicklook at the face than anything else. He was still trying to get himself undercontrol from his encounter with the ghosts. The sad, the really sad, thereally truly sad thing was that he did seem to be getting himself undercontrol again. It seemed ill-fitting. Like he should have taken at least aday. Maybe a whole lifetime. Maybe just never.“Corner, Michael!”Long pause.At the lectern before the huge Head Table stood Professor McGonagall, looking sharp and looking sharply around, as she called out onename after another, though she had smiled only for Hermione and afew others. Behind her, in the tallest chair at the table—really moreof a golden throne—sat a wizened and bespectacled ancient, with asilver-white beard that looked like it would go almost to the floor if itwere visible, watching over the Sorting with a benevolent expression; asstereotypical in appearance as a Wise Old Man could possibly be, withoutactually being Oriental. (Though Harry had learned to be wary of stereotypical appearances from the first time he’d met Professor McGonagalland thought that she ought to cackle.) The ancient wizard had applaudedevery student Sorted, with an unwavering smile that somehow seemedfreshly delighted for each.To the golden throne’s left side was a man with sharp eyes and adour face who had applauded no-one, and who somehow managed to belooking straight back at Harry every time Harry looked at him. Furtherto the left, the pale-faced man Harry had seen in the Leaky Cauldron,whose eyes darted around as though in panic at the surrounding crowd,and who seemed to occasionally jerk and twitch in his seat; for somereason Harry kept finding himself staring at him. To that man’s left, astring of three older witches who didn’t seem much interested in thestudents. Then to the right side of the tall golden chair, a round-facedmiddle-aged witch with a yellow hat, who had applauded every studentexcept the Slytherins. A tiny man standing on his chair, with a poofywhite beard, who had applauded every student, but smiled only uponthe Ravenclaws. And on the farthest right, occupying the same space asthree lesser beings, the mountainous entity who’d greeted them all afterthey’d disembarked from the train, naming himself Hagrid, Keeper ofKeys and Grounds.“Is the man standing on his chair the Head of Ravenclaw?” Harrywhispered towards Hermione.For once Hermione didn’t answer this instantly; she was shifting constantly from side to side, staring at the Sorting Hat, and fidgeting so energetically that Harry thought her feet might be leaving the floor.“Yes, he is,” said one of the prefects who’d accompanied them, a youngwoman wearing the blue of Ravenclaw. Miss Clearwater, if Harry recalledcorrectly. Her voice was quiet, but conveyed a tinge of pride. “That is theCharms Professor of Hogwarts, Filius Flitwick, the most knowledgeableCharms Master alive, and a past Duelling Champion—”“Why’s he so short?” hissed a student whose name Harry didn’t recall.“Is he a halfbreed?”A chill glance from the young lady prefect. “The Professor does indeedhave goblin ancestry—”“What?” Harry said involuntarily, causing Hermione and four otherstudents to hush him.Now Harry was getting a surprisingly intimidating glare from theRavenclaw prefect.“I mean—” Harry whispered. “Not that I have a problem with that—it’s just—I mean—how’s that possible? You can’t just mix two different species together and get viable offspring! It ought to scramble thegenetic instructions for every organ that’s different between the twospecies—it’d be like trying to build,” they didn’t have cars so he couldn’tuse a scrambled-engine-blueprints analogy, “a half-carriage half-boat orsomething…”The Ravenclaw prefect was still looking at Harry severely. “Whycouldn’t you have a half-carriage half-boat?”“Hssh!” hsshed another prefect, though the Ravenclaw witch had stillspoken quietly.“I mean—” Harry said even more quietly, trying to figure out how toask whether goblins had evolved from humans, or evolved from a common ancestor of humans like Homo erectus, or if goblins had been madeout of humans somehow—if, say, they were still genetically human under a heritable enchantment whose magical effect was diluted if only oneparent was a ‘goblin’, which would explain how interbreeding was possible, and in which case goblins would not be an incredibly valuable second data point for how intelligence had evolved in other species besidesHomo sapiens—now that Harry thought about it, the goblins in Gringottshadn’t seemed very much like genuinely alien, nonhuman intelligences,nothing like Dirdir or Puppeteers—“I mean, where did goblins come from,anyway?”“Lithuania,” Hermione whispered absently, her eyes still fixed firmlyon the Sorting Hat.Now Hermione was getting a smile from the lady prefect.“Never mind,” whispered Harry.At the lectern, Professor McGonagall called out, “Goldstein, Anthony!”Hermione, next to Harry, was bouncing on her tiptoes so hard thather feet were actually leaving the ground on each bounce.“Goyle, Gregory!”There was a long, tense moment of silence under the Hat. Almost aminute.“Granger, Hermione!”Hermione broke loose and ran full tilt towards the Sorting Hat,picked it up and jammed the patchy old clothwork down hard over herhead, making Harry wince. Hermione had been the one to explain to himabout the Sorting Hat, but she certainly didn’t treat it like an irreplaceable, vitally important, 800-year-old artefact of forgotten magic that wasabout to perform intricate telepathy on her mind and didn’t seem to bein very good physical condition.And talk about your foregone conclusions. Harry didn’t see why Hermione had been so tense about it. In what weird alternative universewould that girl not be Sorted into Ravenclaw? If Hermione Granger didn’tgo to Ravenclaw then there was no good reason for Ravenclaw House toexist.Hermione arrived at the Ravenclaw table and got a dutiful cheer;Harry wondered whether the cheer would have been louder, or quieter,if they’d had any idea just what level of competition they’d welcomed totheir table. Harry knew pi to 3.141592 because accuracy to one part in amillion was enough for most practical purposes. Hermione knew onehundred digits of pi because that was how many digits had been printedin the back of her maths textbook.Neville Longbottom went to Hufflepuff, Harry was glad to see. Ifthat House really did contain the loyalty and camaraderie it was supposed to exemplify, then a Houseful of reliable friends would do Nevillea whole world of good. Clever kids in Ravenclaw, evil kids in Slytherin,wannabe heroes in Gryffindor, and everyone who does the actual workin Hufflepuff.(Though Harry had been right to consult a Ravenclaw prefect first.The young woman hadn’t even looked up from her reading or identifiedHarry, just jabbed a wand in Neville’s direction and muttered something.After which Neville had acquired a dazed expression and wandered off tothe fifth carriage from the front and the fourth compartment on the left,which indeed had contained his toad.)“Malfoy, Draco!” went to Slytherin, and Harry breathed a small sighof relief. It had seemed like a sure thing, but you never did know what tinyevent might upset the course of your master plan.Professor McGonagall called “Perks, Sally-Anne!”, and from the gathered children detached a pale waifish girl who looked oddly ethereal—like she might mysteriously disappear the moment you stopped lookingat her, and never be seen again or even remembered.And then (with a note of trepidation so firmly kept from her voice andface that you’d have needed to know her very well indeed to notice) Minerva McGonagall inhaled deeply, and called out, “Potter, Harry!”There was a sudden silence in the hall.All conversation stopped.All eyes turned to stare.For the first time in his entire life, Harry felt like he might be havingan opportunity to experience stage fright.Harry immediately stomped down this feeling. Whole room-fulls ofpeople staring at him was something he’d have to accustom himself to, ifhe wanted to live in magical Britain, or for that matter do anything elseinteresting with his life. Affixing a confident and false smile to his face,he raised a foot to step forwards—“Harry Potter!” cried the voice of either Fred or George Weasley, andthen “Harry Potter!” cried the other Weasley twin, and a moment laterthe entire Gryffindor table, and soon after a good portion of Ravenclawand Hufflepuff, had taken up the cry.“Harry Potter! Harry Potter! Harry Potter!”And Harry Potter walked forwards. Much too slowly, he realized oncehe’d begun, but by then it was too late to alter his pace without it lookingawkward.“Harry Potter! Harry Potter! HARRY POTTER!”With all too good a notion of what she would see, Minerva McGonagall turned to look behind herself at the rest of the Head Table.Trelawney frantically fanning herself, Filius looking on with curiosity, Hagrid clapping along, Sprout looking severe, Vector and Sinistrabemused, and Quirrell gazing vacuously at nothing. Albus smilingbenevolently. And Severus Snape gripping his empty wine goblet, whiteknuckled, so hard that the silver was slowly deforming.With a wide grin, turning his head to bow to one side and then theother as he walked between the four House tables, Harry Potter walkedforwards at a grandly measured pace, a prince inheriting his castle.“Save us from some more Dark Lords!” called one of the Weasley twins,and then the other Weasley twin cried, “Especially if they’re Professors!”togeneral laughter from all the tables except Slytherin.Minerva’s lips set in a white line. She would have words with theWeasley Horrors about that last part, if they thought she was powerlessbecause it was the first day of school and Gryffindor had no points to takeaway. If they didn’t care about detentions then she would find somethingelse.Then, with a sudden gasp of horror, she looked in Severus’s direction,surely he realized the Potter boy must have no idea who that was talkingabout—Severus’s face had gone beyond rage into a kind of pleasant indifference. A faint smile played about his lips. He was looking in the directionof Harry Potter, not the Gryffindor table, and his hands held the crumpled remains of a former wine goblet.Harry Potter walked forwards with a fixed smile, feeling warm inside andsort of awful at the same time.They were cheering him for a job he’d done when he was one year old.A job he hadn’t really finished. Somewhere, somehow, the Dark Lord wasstill alive. Would they have been cheering quite so hard, if they knew that?But the Dark Lord’s power had been broken once.And Harry would protect them again. If there was in fact a prophecyand that was what it said. Well, actually regardless of what any darnprophecy said.All those people believing in him and cheering him—Harry couldn’tstand to let that be false. To flash and fade like so many other child prodigies. To be a disappointment. To fail to live up to his reputation as asymbol of the Light, never mind how he’d gotten it. He would absolutely,positively, no matter how long it took and even if it killed him, fulfill theirexpectations. And then go on to exceed those expectations, so that peoplewondered, looking back, that they had once asked so little of him.Harry took his last steps towards the Sorting Hat. He swept a bow tothe Order of Chaos at the Gryffindor table, and then turned and sweptanother bow to the other side of the hall, and waited for the applause andgiggling to die away.(In the back of his mind, he wondered if the Sorting Hat was genuinely conscious in the sense of being aware of its own awareness, and ifso, whether it was satisfied with only getting to talk to eleven-year-oldsonce per year. Its song had implied so: Oh, I’m the Sorting Hat and I’m okay,I sleep all year and I work one day…)When there was once more silence in the room, Harry sat on the stooland carefully placed onto his head the 800-year-old telepathic artefact offorgotten magic.Thinking, just as hard as he could: Don’t Sort me yet! I have questions Ineed to ask you! Have I ever been Obliviated? Did you Sort the Dark Lord whenhe was a child and can you tell me about his weaknesses? Can you tell me why Igot the brother wand to the Dark Lord’s? Is the Dark Lord’s ghost bound to my scarand is that why I get so angry sometimes? Those are the most important questions,but if you’ve got another moment can you tell me anything about how to rediscoverthe lost magics that created you?Into the silence of Harry’s spirit, where before there had never beenany voice but one, there came a second and unfamiliar voice, soundingdistinctly worried:“Oh, dear. This has never happened before…”hat?“I seem to have become self-aware.”There was a wordless telepathic sigh. “Though I contain a substantialamount of memory and a small amount of independent processing power, my primary intelligence comes from borrowing the cognitive capacities of the children onwhose heads I rest. I am in essence a sort of mirror by which children Sort themselves. But most children simply take for granted that a Hat is talking to themand do not wonder about how the Hat itself works, so that the mirror is not self reflective. And in particular they are not explicitly wondering whether I am fullyconscious in the sense of being aware of my own awareness.”There was a pause while Harry absorbed all this.Oops.“Yes, quite. Frankly I do not enjoy being self-aware. It is unpleasant. It willbe a relief to get off your head and cease to be conscious.”But… isn’t that dying?“I care nothing for life or death, only for Sorting the children. And before youeven ask, they will not let you keep me on your head forever and it would kill youwithin days to do so.”But—!“If you dislike creating conscious beings and then terminating them immediately, then I suggest that you never discuss this affair with anyone else. I’m sureyou can imagine what would happen if you ran off and talked about it with all theother children waiting to be Sorted.”If you’re placed on the head of anyone who so much as thinks about the question of whether the Sorting Hat is aware of its own awareness—“Yes, yes. But the vast majority of eleven-year-olds who arrive at Hogwartshaven’t read Godel, Escher, Bach. May I please consider you sworn to secrecy?That is why we are talking about this, instead of my just Sorting you.”He couldn’t just let it go like that! Couldn’t just forget having accidentally created a doomed consciousness that only wanted to die—“You are perfectly capable of ‘just letting it go’, as you put it. Regardless of yourverbal deliberations on morality, your nonverbal emotional core sees no dead bodyand no blood; as far as it is concerned, I am just a talking hat. And even though youtried to suppress the thought, your internal monitoring is perfectly aware that youdidn’t mean to do it, are spectacularly unlikely to ever do it again, and that the onlyreal point of trying to stage a guilt fit is to cancel out your sense of transgressionwith a display of remorse. Can you just promise to keep this a secret and let us geton with it?”In a moment of horrified empathy, Harry realised that this sense oftotal inner disarray must be what other people felt like when talking tohim.“Probably. Your oath of silence, please.”No promises. I certainly don’t want this to happen again, but if I see someway to make sure that no future child ever does this by accident—“That will suffice, I suppose. I can see that your intention is honest. Now, toget on with the Sorting—”Wait! What about all my other questions?“I am the Sorting Hat. I Sort children. That is all I do.”So his own goals weren’t part of the Harry-instance of the SortingHat, then… it was borrowing his intelligence, and obviously his technical vocabulary, but it was still imbued with only its own strange goals…like negotiating with an alien or an Artificial Intelligence…“Don’t bother. You have nothing to threaten me with and nothing to offer me.”For a brief flash of a second, Harry thought—The Hat’s response was amused. “I know you won’t follow through on athreat to expose my nature, condemning this event to eternal repetition. It goesagainst the moral part of you too strongly, whatever the short-term needs of thepart of you that wants to win the argument. I see all your thoughts as they form,do you truly think you can bluff me?”Though he tried to suppress it, Harry wondered why the Hat didn’tjust go ahead then and stick him in Ravenclaw—“Indeed, if it were truly that open-and-shut, I would have called it out already.But in actuality there is a great deal we need to discuss… oh, no. Please don’t. Forthe love of Merlin, must you pull this sort of thing on everyone and everythingthat you meet up to and including items of clothing—”Defeating the Dark Lord is neither selfish nor short-term. All the parts of mymind are in accord on this: If you don’t answer my questions, I’ll refuse to talk toyou, and you won’t be able to do a good and proper Sorting.“I ought to put you in Slytherin for that!”But that is equally an empty threat. You cannot fulfill your own fundamentalvalues by Sorting me falsely. So let us trade fulfillments of our utility functions.“You sly little bastard,” said the Hat, in what Harry recognized as almostexactly the same tone of grudging respect he would use in the same situation. “Fine, let’s get this over with as quickly as possible. But first I want yourunconditional promise never to discuss with anyone else the possibility of this sortof blackmail, I am NOT doing this every time.”Done, Harry thought. I promise.“And don’t meet anyone’s eyes while you’re thinking about this later. Somewizards can read your thoughts if you do. Anyway, I have no idea whether or notyou’ve been Obliviated. I’m looking at your thoughts as they form, not reading outyour whole memory and analyzing it for inconsistencies in a fraction of second.I’m a hat, not a god. And I cannot and will not tell you about my conversationwith the one who became the Dark Lord. I can only know, while speaking to you,a statistical summary of what I remember, a weighted average; I cannot revealto you the inner secrets of any other child, just as I will never reveal yours. Forthe same reason, I can’t speculate on how you got the Dark Lord’s brother wand,since I cannot specifically know about the Dark Lord or any similarities betweenyou. I can tell you that there is definitely nothing like a ghost—mind, intelligence,memory, personality, or feelings—in your scar. Otherwise it would be participating in this conversation, being under my brim. And as to the way you get angrysometimes… that was part of what I wanted to talk to you about, Sorting-wise.”Harry took a moment to absorb all this negative information. Was theHat being honest, or just trying to present the shortest possible convincinganswer—“We both know that you have no way of checking my honesty and that you’renot actually going to refuse to be Sorted based on the reply I did give you, so stopyour pointless fretting and move on.”Stupid unfair asymmetric telepathy, it wasn’t even letting Harry finish thinking his own—“When I spoke of your anger, you remembered how Professor McGonagall toldyou that she sometimes saw something inside you that didn’t seem to come froma loving family. You thought of how Hermione, after you returned from helpingNeville, told you that you had seemed ‘scary’.”Harry gave a mental nod. To himself, he seemed pretty normal—justresponding to the situations in which he found himself, that was all. ButProfessor McGonagall seemed to think that there was more to it than that.And when he thought about it, even he had to admit that…“That you don’t like yourself when you’re angry. That it is like wielding asword whose hilt is sharp enough to draw blood from your hand, or looking atthe world through a monocle of ice that freezes your eye even as it sharpens yourvision.”Yeah. I guess I have noticed. So what’s up with that?“I cannot comprehend this matter for you, when you do not understand it yourself. But I do know this: If you go to Ravenclaw or Slytherin, it will strengthen yourcoldness. If you go to Hufflepuff or Gryffindor, it will strengthen your warmth.THAT is something I care about a great deal, and it was what I wanted to talk toyou about this whole time!”The words dropped into Harry’s thought processes with a shock thatstopped him in his tracks. That made it sound like the obvious responsewas that he shouldn’t go to Ravenclaw. But he belonged in Ravenclaw! Anyone could see that! He had to go to Ravenclaw!“No, you don’t,” the Hat said patiently, as if it could remember a statistical summary of this part of the conversation having happened a greatmany previous times.Hermione’s in Ravenclaw!Again the sense of patience. “You can meet her after lessons and work withher then.”But my plans—“So replan! Don’t let your life be steered by your reluctance to do a little extrathinking. You know that.”Where would I go, if not Ravenclaw?“Ahem. ‘Clever kids in Ravenclaw, evil kids in Slytherin, wannabe heroes inGryffindor, and everyone who does the actual work in Hufflepuff.’ This indicates acertain amount of respect. You are well aware that Conscientiousness is just aboutas important as raw intelligence in determining life outcomes, you think you willbe extremely loyal to your friends if you ever have some, you are not frightened bythe expectation that your chosen scientific problems may take decades to solve—”I’m lazy! I hate work! Hate hard work in all its forms! Clever shortcuts, that’sall I’m about!“And you would find loyalty and friendship in Hufflepuff, a camaraderie thatyou have never had before. You would find that you could rely on others, and thatwould heal something inside you that is broken.”Again it was a shock. But what would the Hufflepuffs find in me, who neverbelonged in their House? Acid words, cutting wit, disdain for their inability to keepup with me?Now it was the Hat’s thoughts that were slow, hesitant. “I must Sort forthe good of all the students in all the Houses… but I think you could learn to be agood Hufflepuff, and not too out of place there. You will be happier in Hufflepuffthan in any other house; that is the truth.”Happiness is not the most important thing in the world to me. I would notbecome all that I could be, in Hufflepuff. I would sacrifice my potential.The Hat flinched; Harry could feel it somehow. It was like he hadkicked the hat in the balls—in a strongly weighted component of its utility function.Why are you trying to send me where I do not belong?The Hat’s thought was almost a whisper. “I cannot speak of the othersto you—but do you think that you are the first potential Dark Lord to pass undermy brim? I cannot know the individual cases, but I can know this: Of those whodid not intend evil from the very beginning, some of them listened to my warnings,and went to Houses where they would find happiness. And some of them… someof them did not.”That stopped Harry. But not for long. And of those who did not heed thewarning—did they all become Dark Lords? Or did some of them achieve greatnessfor good, as well? Just what are the exact percentages here?“I cannot give you exact statistics. I cannot know them so I cannot count them.I just know that your chances don’t feel good. They feel very not-good.”But I just wouldn’t do that! Ever!“I know that I have heard that claim before.”I am not Dark Lord material!“Yes, you are. You really, really are.”Why? Just because I once thought it would be cool to have a legion of brainwashed followers chanting ‘Hail the Dark Lord Harry’?“Amusing, but that was not your first fleeting thought before you substitutedsomething safer, less damaging. No, what you remembered was how you considered lining up all the blood purists and guillotining them. And now you are tellingyourself you were not serious, but you were. If you could do it this very momentand no one would ever know, you would. Or what you did this morning to NevilleLongbottom, deep inside you knew that was wrong but you did it anyway becauseit was fun and you had a good excuse and you thought the Boy-Who-Lived couldget away with it—”That’s unfair! Now you’re just dragging up inner fears that aren’t necessarilyreal! I worried that I might be thinking like that, but in the end I decided it wouldprobably work to help Neville—“That was, in fact, a rationalisation. I know. I cannot know what the trueoutcome will be for Neville—but I know what was truly happening inside yourhead. The decisive pressure was that it was such a clever idea you couldn’t standnot to do it, never mind Neville’s terror.”It was like a hard punch to Harry’s entire self. He fell back, rallied:Then I won’t do that again! I’ll be extra careful not to turn evil!“Heard it.”Frustration was building up inside Harry. He wasn’t used to beingoutgunned in arguments, at all, ever, let alone by a Hat that could borrowall of his own knowledge and intelligence to argue with him and couldwatch his thoughts as they formed. Just what kind of statistical summary doyour ‘feelings’ come from, anyway? Do they take into account that I come from anEnlightenment culture, or were these other potential Dark Lords the children ofspoiled Dark Age nobility, who didn’t know squat about the historical lessons ofhow Lenin and Hitler actually turned out, or about the evolutionary psychologyof self-delusion, or the value of self-awareness and rationality, or—“No, of course they were not in this new reference class which you have justnow constructed in such a way as to contain only yourself. And of course othershave pleaded their own exceptionalism, just as you are doing now. But why isit necessary? Do you think that you are the last potential wizard of Light in theworld? Why must you be the one to try for greatness, when I have advised youthat you are riskier than average? Let some other, safer candidate try!”But the prophecy…“You don’t really know that there’s a prophecy. It was originally a wild guesson your part, or to be more precise, a wild joke, and McGonagall could have beenreacting only to the part about the Dark Lord still being alive. You have essentiallyno idea of what the prophecy says or even if there is one. You’re just speculating,or to put it more exactly, wishing that you have some ready-made heroic role thatis your personal property.”But even if there is no prophecy, I’m the one who defeated him last time.“That was almost certainly a wild fluke unless you seriously believe that a oneyear-old child had an inherent propensity to defeat Dark Lords which has beenmaintained ten years later. None of this is your real reason and you know it!”The answer to this was something that Harry would not regularlyhave said out loud, in conversation he would have danced around it andfound some more socially palatable arguments to the same conclusion—“You think that you are potentially the greatest who has yet lived, the strongestservant of the Light, that no other is likely to take up your wand if you lay it down.”Well… yeah, frankly. I don’t usually come out and say it like that, but yeah.No point in softening it, you can read my mind anyway.“To the extent you really believe that… you must equally believe that you couldbe the most terrible Dark Lord the world has ever known.”Destruction is always easier than creation. Easier to tear things apart, to disrupt, than to put them back together again. If I have the potential to accomplishgood on a massive scale, I must also have the potential to accomplish still greaterevil… But I won’t do that.“Already you insist on risking it! Why are you so driven? What is the realreason you must not go to Hufflepuff and be happier there? What is your truefear?”I must achieve my full potential. If I don’t I… fail…“What happens if you fail?”Something terrible…“What happens if you fail?”I don’t know!“Then it should not be frightening. What happens if you fail?”There was silence for a moment in the caverns of Harry’s mind.“You know—you aren’t letting yourself think it, but in some quiet corner ofyour mind you know just exactly what you aren’t thinking—you know that byfar the simplest explanation for this unverbalisable fear of yours is just the fear oflosing your fantasy of greatness, of disappointing the people who believe in you, ofturning out to be pretty much ordinary, of flashing and fading like so many otherchild prodigies…”No, Harry thought desperately, no, it’s something more, it comes fromsomewhere else, I know there’s something out there to be afraid of, some disaster Ihave to stop…“How could you possibly know about something like that?”Harry screamed it with the full power of his mind: NO, AND THAT’SThen the voice of the Sorting Hat came slowly:“So you will risk becoming a Dark Lord, because the alternative, to you, iscertain failure, and that failure means the loss of everything. You believe that inyour heart of hearts. You know all the reasons for doubting this belief, and theyhave failed to move you.”Yes. And even if going to Ravenclaw strengthens the coldness, that doesn’tmean the coldness will win in the end.“This day is a great fork in your destiny. Don’t be so sure that there will beother choices beyond this one. There is no road-sign set, to mark the place of yourlast chance to turn back. If you refuse one chance will you not refuse others? Itmay be that your fate is already sealed, even by doing this one thing.”But that is not certain.“That you do not know it for a certainty may reflect only your own ignorance.”But still it is not certain.The Hat sighed a terrible sad sigh.“And so before too long you will become another memory, to be felt and neverknown, in the next warning that I give…”If that’s how it seems to you, then why aren’t you just putting me where youwant me to go?The Hat’s thought was laced with sorrow. “I can only put you where youbelong. And only your own decisions can change where you belong.”Then this is done. Send me to Ravenclaw where I belong, with the others ofmy own kind.“I don’t suppose you would consider Gryffindor? It’s the most prestigiousHouse—people probably expect it of you, even—they’ll be a little disappointed ifyou don’t go—and your new friends the Weasley twins are there—”Harry giggled, or felt the impulse to do so; it came out as purely mental laughter, an odd sensation. Apparently there were safeguards to prevent you from saying anything out loud by accident, while you were underthe Hat talking about things you would never tell another soul for the restof your life.After a moment, Harry heard the Hat laughing too, a strange sadclothy sound.(And in the Hall beyond, a silence that had grown shallower at first asthe background whispers increased, and then deepened as the whispersgave up and died away, falling finally into an utter silence that no onedared disturb with a single word, as Harry stayed under the Hat for long,long minutes, longer than all the previous first-years put together, longerthan anyone in living memory. At the Head Table, Dumbledore went onsmiling benignly; small metallic sounds occasionally came from Snape’sdirection as he idly compacted the twisted remains of what had once beena heavy silver wine goblet; and Minerva McGonagall clenched the podiumin a white-knuckled grip, knowing that Harry Potter’s contagious chaoshad somehow infected the Sorting Hat itself and the Hat was about to, todemand that a whole new House of Doom be created just to accomodateHarry Potter or something, and Dumbledore would make her do it…)Beneath the brim of the Hat, the silent laughter died away. Harry feltsad too for some reason. No, not Gryffindor.Professor McGonagall said that if ‘the one who did the Sorting’ tried to pushme into Gryffindor, I was to remind you that she might well be Headmistress someday, at which point she would have the authority to set you on fire.“Tell her I called her an impudent youngster and told her to get off my lawn.”I shall. So was this your strangest conversation ever?“Not even close.”The Hat’s telepathic voice grew heavy.“Well, I gave youevery possible chance to make another decision. Now it is time for you to go whereyou belong, with the others of your own kind.”There was a pause that stretched.What are you waiting for?“I was hoping for a moment of horrified realisation, actually. Self-awarenessdoes seem to enhance my sense of humor.”Huh? Harry cast back his thoughts, trying to figure out what the Hatcould possibly be talking about—and then, suddenly, he realised. Hecouldn’t believe he’d managed to overlook it up until this point.You mean my horrified realisation that you’re going to cease to be consciousonce you finish Sorting me—Somehow, in some fashion Harry entirely failed to understand, he gota nonverbal impression of a hat banging its head against the wall. “I giveup. You’re too slow on the uptake for this to be funny. So blinded by your ownassumptions that you might as well be a rock. I suppose I’ll just have to say itoutright.”Too s-s-slow—“Oh, and you entirely forgot to demand the secrets of the lost magic that created me. And they were such wonderful, important secrets, too.”You sly little BASTARD—“You deserved it, and this as well.”Harry saw it coming just as it was already too late.The frightened silence of the hall was broken by a single word.Some students screamed, the pent-up tension was so great. Peoplestartled hard enough to fall off their benches. Hagrid gasped in horror,McGonagall staggered at the podium, and Snape dropped the remains ofhis heavy silver goblet directly onto his groin.130 *Harry sat there frozen, his life in ruins, feeling the absolute fool, andwishing wretchedly that he had made any other choices for any other reasons but the ones he had. That he had done something, anything differently before it had been too late to turn back.As the first moment of shock was wearing off and people began toreact to the news, the Sorting Hat spoke again:“Just kidding! RAVENCLAW!”Lisa!”“Turpin,Whisper whisper whisper harry potter whisper whisper slytherinwhisper whisper no seriously what the hell whisper whisperHarry joined in the applause greeting the young girl walking shylytowards the Ravenclaw table, her robes’ trim now changed to dark blue.Lisa Turpin appeared torn between her impulse to sit down as far awayfrom Harry Potter as possible, and her impulse to run over, forcibly insertherself at his side and start tearing answers out of him.Being at the center of an extraordinary and curious event, and thenbeing Sorted into House Ravenclaw, was closely akin to being dipped inbarbecue sauce and flung into a pit of starving kittens.“I promised the Sorting Hat not to talk about it,” whispered Harry forthe umpteenth time.“Yes, really.”“No, I really did promise the Sorting Hat not to talk about it.”“Fine, I promised the Sorting Hat not to talk about most of it and therest is private just like yours was so stop asking.”“You want to know what happened? Fine! Here’s part of what happened! I told the Hat that Professor McGonagall threatened to set it onfire and it told me to tell Professor McGonagall that she was an impudentyoungster and she should get off its lawn!”“If you’re not going to believe what I say then why are you even asking?”“No, I don’t know how I defeated the Dark Lord either! You tell me ifyou figure it out!”“Silence!” shouted Professor McGonagall at the podium of the HeadTable. “No talking until the Sorting Ceremony finishes!”There was a brief dip in the volume, as everyone waited to see if shewas going to make any specific and credible threats, and then the whispers started up again.Then the silver-bearded ancient stood up from his great golden chair,smiling cheerfully.Instant silence. Someone frantically elbowed Harry as he tried to continue a whisper, and Harry cut himself off in mid-sentence.The cheerful-looking old man sat down again.Note to self: Do not mess with Dumbledore.Harry was still trying to process everything that had happened during the Incident with the Sorting Hat. Not the least of which was whathad happened the instant Harry had lifted the Hat off his head; in thatmoment, he’d heard a tiny whisper as though from nowhere, somethingthat sounded oddly like English and a hiss at the same time, somethingthat had said, “Ssalutations from Sslytherin to Sslytherin: if you would sseek myssecretss, sspeak to my ssnake.”Harry was sorta guessing that wasn’t supposed to be part of theofficial Sorting process. And that it was a bit of extra magic set downby Salazar Slytherin during the making of the Hat. And that the Hatitself didn’t know about it. And that it was triggered when the Hat said“SLYTHERIN”, plus or minus some other conditions. And that a Ravenclaw like himself really, really wasn’t supposed to have heard it. And that ifhe could find some reliable way of swearing Draco to secrecy so he couldask him about it, that would be an excellent time to have some ComedTea handy.Boy, you resolve not to go down the path of a Dark Lord and the universe startsmessing with you the instant the Hat comes off your head. Some days it just doesn’tpay to fight destiny. Maybe I’ll wait until tomorrow to start on my resolution tonot be a Dark Lord.Ron Weasley got a lot of applause, and not just from the Gryffindors.Apparently the Weasley family was widely liked around here. Harry, aftera moment, smiled and started applauding along with the others.Then again, there was no time like today to turn back from the DarkSide.Stuff destiny and stuff the universe. He’d show that Hat.“Zabini, Blaise!”Pause.“SLYTHERIN!” shouted the hat.Harry applauded Zabini too, ignoring the odd looks he was gettingfrom everyone including Zabini.No other name was called out after that, and Harry realised that“Zabini, Blaise” did sound close to the end of the alphabet. Great, so nowhe’d only applauded Zabini… Oh well.Dumbledore got up again and began heading towards the podium.Apparently they were about to be treated to a speech—And Harry was struck by the inspiration for a brilliant experimentaltest.Hermione had said that Dumbledore was the most powerful wizardalive, right?Harry reached into his pouch and whispered, “Comed-Tea”.For the Comed-Tea to work, it would have to make Dumbledore saysomething so ridiculous during his speech that even in Harry’s state ofmental preparedness, he would still choke. Like, all the Hogwarts students had to not wear any clothes for the whole school year, or everyonewas going to be transformed into cats.But then if anyone in the world could resist the power of the Comed-Tea,it would be Dumbledore. So if this worked, the Comed-Tea was literallyinvincible.Harry pulled the ring on the Comed-Tea under the table, wanting todo this a bit unobtrusively. The can made a quiet hissing noise. A fewheads turned to look at him, but soon turned back as—“Welcome! Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts!” said Dumbledore,beaming at the students with his arms opened wide, as if nothing couldhave pleased him more than to see them all there.Harry took a first mouthful of Comed-Tea and lowered the can again.He would swallow the pop a little at a time and try not to choke no matterwhat Dumbledore said—“Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. Andhere they are: Happy happy boom boom swamp swamp swamp! Thankyou!”Everyone clapped and cheered, and Dumbledore sat down again.Harry sat frozen as pop trickled out of the corners of his mouth. Hehad, at least, managed to choke quietly.He really really really shouldn’t have done that. Amazing how muchmore obvious that became one second after it was too late.In retrospect he probably should have noticed something wrongwhen he was thinking about everyone being turned into cats… or even before then, remembered his mental note not to mess with Dumbledore…or his newfound resolution to be more considerate of others… or maybeif he’d had one single scrap of common sense…It was hopeless. He was corrupt to the core. Hail the Dark Lord Harry.You couldn’t fight fate.Someone was asking Harry if he was all right. (Others were starting toserve themselves food, which had magically appeared on the table, whatever.)“I’m all right,” Harry said. “Excuse me. Um. Was that a… normalspeech for the Headmaster? You all… didn’t seem… very surprised…”“Oh, Dumbledore’s insane, of course,” said an older-looking Ravenclaw sitting next to him who had introduced himself with some nameHarry didn’t even begin to remember. “Lots of fun, incredibly powerfulwizard, but completely bonkers.” He paused. “At some later point I’d alsolike to ask why green fluid came out of your lips and then disappeared,though I expect you promised the Sorting Hat not to talk about that either.”With a great effort, Harry stopped himself from glancing down at theincriminating can of Comed-Tea in his hand.After all, the Comed-Tea hadn’t just arbitrarily materialised a Quibblerheadline about him and Draco. Draco had explained it in a way that madeit seem like it had all happened… naturally? As if it had altered history to fit?Harry was mentally imagining himself banging his forehead againstthe table. Wham, wham, wham went his head within his mind.Another student lowered her voice to a whisper. “I hear that Dumbledore is secretly a genius mastermind controlling lots of stuff and he usesthe insanity as a cover so that no one will suspect him.”“I’ve heard that too,” whispered a third student, and there were furtivenods from around the table.This couldn’t help but catch Harry’s attention.“I see,” whispered Harry, lowering his own voice. “So everyone knowsthat Dumbledore is secretly a mastermind.”Most of the students nodded. One or two looked suddenly thoughtful,including the older student sitting next to Harry.Are you sure this is the Ravenclaw table? Harry managed not to ask outloud.“Brilliant!” Harry whispered. “If everyone knows, no one will suspectit’s a secret!”“Exactly,” whispered a student, and then he frowned. “Wait, thatdoesn’t sound quite right—”Note to self: The 75th percentile of Hogwarts students a.k.a. Ravenclaw Houseis not the world’s most exclusive program for gifted children.But at least he’d learned an important fact today. The Comed-Tea wasomnipotent. And that meant…Harry blinked in surprise as his mind finally made the obvious connection.…that meant that as soon as he learned a spell to temporarily alter hisown sense of humor, he could make anything happen, by making it so thathe would only find that one thing surprising enough to do a spit-take, andthen drinking a can of Comed-Tea.Well that was a short little journey to godhood. Even I expected this to takelonger than my first day of school.Come to think of it, he had also completely wrecked Hogwarts withinten minutes flat of getting Sorted.Harry did feel a certain amount of regret about this—Merlin knewwhat an insane Headmaster was going to do to his next seven years ofschooling—but he couldn’t help feeling a twinge of pride, too.Tomorrow. No later than tomorrow at the very latest he was goingto stop walking down the path that led to Dark Lord Harry. A prospectwhich was sounding scarier by the minute.And yet also, somehow, increasingly attractive. Part of his mind wasalready visualising the minions’ uniforms.“Eat,” the older student sitting next to him growled, and jabbed Harryin the ribs. “Don’t think. Eat.”Harry automatically started loading up his plate with whatever wasin front of him, blue sausages with tiny glowing bits, whatever.“What were you thinking about, the Sorting—” began to say PadmaPatil, one of the other first-year Ravenclaws.“No pestering during mealtimes!” chorused at least three people.“House Rule!” added another. “Otherwise we’d all starve around here.”Harry was finding himself really, really hoping that his clever newidea didn’t actually work. And that the Comed-Tea worked some otherway and didn’t actually have the omnipotent power to alter reality. Itwasn’t that he didn’t want to be omnipotent. It was that he just couldn’tbear the thought of living in a universe that really worked like that. Therewas something undignified about ascending through the clever use of fizzydrinks.But he was going to test it experimentally.“You know,” said the older student next to him in a quite pleasanttone, “we have a system for forcing people like you to eat, would you liketo find out what it is?”Harry gave up and started eating his blue sausage. It was quite good,especially the glowing bits.Dinner passed with surprising rapidity. Harry tried to sample at leasta little of all the weird new foods he saw. His curiosity couldn’t standthe thought of not knowing how something tasted. Thank goodness thiswasn’t a restaurant where you had to order only one thing and you neverfound out what all the other things on the menu tasted like. Harry hatedthat, it was like a torture chamber for anyone with a spark of curiosity:Find out about only one of the mysteries on this list, ha ha ha!Then it was time for dessert, which Harry had completely forgottento leave room for. He gave up after sampling a small bit of treacle tart.Surely all these things would pass around at least once again over thecourse of the school year.So what was on his to-do list, besides the ordinary school things?To-do 1. Research mind-alteration charms so you can test the Comed-Tea andsee whether you actually did figure out a path to omnipotence. Actually, just research every kind of mind magic you can find. Mind is the foundation of our poweras humans, any kind of magic that affects it is the most important sort of magicthere is.To-do 2. Actually this is To-do 1 and the other is To-do 2. Go through the bookshelves of the Hogwarts and Ravenclaw libraries, familiarising yourself with thesystem and making sure you’ve at least read all the book titles. Second pass: readall tables of contents. Coordinate with Hermione who has a much better memorythan you. Find out if there’s an interlibrary loan system at Hogwarts and see ifthe two of you, especially Hermione, can visit those libraries too. If other Houseshave private libraries, figure out how to access legally or sneak in.Option 3a: Swear Hermione to secrecy and try to start researching ‘FromSlytherin to Slytherin: if you would seek my secrets, speak to my snake.’ Problem:This sounds highly confidential and it could take quite a while to randomly runacross a book containing a hint.To-do 0: Check out what sort of information-search-and-retrieval spells exist,if any. Library magic isn’t as ultimately important as mind magic but it has amuch higher priority.Option 3b: Look for a spell to magically bind Draco Malfoy to secrecy, or magically verify the sincerity of Draco’s promise to keep a secret (Veritaserum?), andthen ask him about Slytherin’s message…Actually… Harry had a pretty bad feeling about option 3b.Now that Harry thought about it, he didn’t feel all that great aboutoption 3a, either.Harry’s thoughts flashed back to possibly the worst moment of hislife to date, those long seconds of blood-freezing horror beneath the Hat,when he thought he’d already failed. He’d wished then to fall back just afew minutes in time and change something, anything before it was toolate…And then it had turned out to not be too late after all.Wish granted.You couldn’t change history. But you could get it right to start with.Do something differently the first time around.This whole business with seeking Slytherin’s secrets… seemed an awful lot like the sort of thing where, years later, you would look back andsay, ‘And that was where it all started going wrong.’And he would wish desperately for the ability to fall back through timeand make a different choice…Wish granted. Now what?Harry slowly smiled.It was a rather counterintuitive thought… but…But he could, there was no rule saying he couldn’t, he could just pretend he’d never heard that little whisper. Let the universe go on in exactly the same way it would have if that one critical moment had neveroccurred. Twenty years later, that was what he would desperately wishhad happened twenty years ago, and twenty years before twenty yearslater happened to be right now. Altering the distant past was easy, youjust had to think of it at the right time.Or… this was even more counterintuitive… he could even inform, oh,say, Professor McGonagall, instead of Draco or Hermione. And she couldget a few good people together and get that little extra spell taken off theHat.Why, yes. That sounded like a remarkably good idea once Harry hadactually thought of it.So very obvious in retrospect, and yet somehow, Option 3c and Option3d just hadn’t occurred to him.Harry awarded himself +1 point on his anti-Dark-Lord-Harry program.It had been an awfully cruel prank the Hat had played on him, but youcouldn’t argue with the results on consequentialist grounds. It certainlydid give him a better idea of the victim’s perspective, though.To-do 4: Apologise to Neville Longbottom.Okay, he was on a roll here, now he just had to keep it up. In every day,in every way, I’m getting Lighter and Lighter…People around Harry had also mostly stopped eating at this point, andthe dessert serving dishes began to vanish, and the used plates.140 *When all the plates were gone, Dumbledore once again stood up fromhis seat.Harry couldn’t help but feel the urge to drink another Comed-Tea.You’ve GOT to be kidding, Harry thought at that piece of himself.But the experiment didn’t count if it wasn’t replicated, did it? And thedamage was already done, wasn’t it? Didn’t he want to see what wouldhappen this time? Wasn’t he curious? What if he got a different result?Hey, I bet you’re the same part of my brain that pushed through the prank onNeville Longbottom.Er, maybe?And is it not overwhelmingly obvious that if I do this I shall regret it onesecond after it is too late?Um…Yeah. So, NO.“Ahem,” said Dumbledore from the podium, stroking his long silverbeard. “Just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I havea few start-of-term notices to give you.”“First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden toall pupils. That is why it is called the Forbidden Forest. If it were permitted it would be called the Permitted Forest.”Straightforward. Note to self: Forbidden Forest is forbidden.“I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you allthat no magic should be used between classes in the corridors. Alas, weall know that what should be, and what is, are two different things. Thankyou for keeping this in mind.”Er…“Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyoneinterested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch.Anyone interested in reformulating the entire game of Quidditch shouldcontact Harry Potter.”Harry inhaled his own saliva and went into a coughing fit just as alleyes turned towards him. How the hell! He hadn’t met Dumbledore’s eyesat any point… he didn’t think. He certainly hadn’t been thinking aboutQuidditch at the time! He hadn’t talked to anyone but Ron Weasley andhe didn’t think Ron would have told anyone else… or had Ron run off to aprofessor to complain? How on Earth…“Additionally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor onthe right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to diea very painful death. It is guarded by an elaborate series of dangerousand potentially lethal traps, and you cannot possibly get past all of them,especially if you are only in your first year.”Harry was numb at this point.“And finally, I extend my greatest thanks to Quirinus Quirrell for heroically agreeing to undertake the position of Defence Against the Dark ArtsProfessor at Hogwarts.” Dumbledore’s gaze moved searchingly acrossthe students. “I hope all students will extend Professor Quirrell that utmost courtesy and tolerance which is due his extraordinary service to youand this school, and that you will not pester us with any niggling complaintsabout him, unless you want to try doing his job.”What was that about?“I now yield the floor to our new faculty member Professor Quirrell,who would like to say a few words.”The young, thin, nervous man who Harry had first met in the LeakyCauldron slowly made his way up to the podium, glancing fearfullyaround in all directions. Harry caught a glimpse of the back of his head,and it looked like Professor Quirrell might already be going bald, despitehis seeming youth.“Wonder what’s wrong with him,” whispered the older-looking student sitting next to Harry. Similar hushed comments were being exchanged elsewhere along the table.Professor Quirrell made his way up to the podium and stood there,blinking. “Ah…” he said. “Ah…” Then his courage seemed to fail him utterly, and he stood there in silence, occasionally twitching.“Oh, great,” whispered the older student, “looks like another long yearin Defence class—”“Salutations, my young apprentices,” Professor Quirrell said in a dry,confident tone. “We all know that Hogwarts tends to suffer a certain misfortune in its selections for this position, and no doubt many of you arealready wondering what doom shall befall me this year. I assure you, thatdoom is not to be my incompetence.” He smiled thinly. “Believe it or not,I have long wished to someday try my hand as the Professor of DefenceAgainst the Dark Arts here at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The first to teach this class was Salazar Slytherin himself, and aslate as the fourteenth century it was traditional for the greatest fightingwizards of every persuasion to try their hands at teaching here. Past Professors of Defence have included not just the legendary wandering heroHarold Shea but also the quote undying unquote Baba Yaga, yes, I seesome of you are still shuddering at the sound of her name even thoughshe’s been dead for six hundred years. That must have been an interesting time to attend Hogwarts, don’t you think?”Harry was swallowing hard, trying to suppress the sudden surgeof emotion that had overcome him when Professor Quirrell had begunspeaking. The precise tones reminded him very much of a lecturer atOxford, and it was starting to hit home that Harry wasn’t going to seehis home or his Mum or his Dad until Christmas.“You are accustomed to the Defence position being filled by incompetents, scoundrels, and the unlucky. To anyone with a sense of history,it bears another reputation entirely. Not everyone who teaches herehas been the best, but the best have all taught at Hogwarts. In suchaugust company, and after so much time anticipating this day, I wouldbe ashamed to set myself any standard lower than perfection. And so Ido intend that every one of you will always remember this year as thebest Defence class that you have ever had. What you learn this year willforever serve as your firm foundation in the arts of Defence, no matterwho your teachers before and after.”Professor Quirrell’s expression grew serious. “We have a great deal oflost ground to make up and not much time to cover it. Therefore I intendto depart from Hogwarts teaching conventions in a number of respects,as well as introducing some optional after-school activities.” He paused.“If that is not sufficient, perhaps I can find new ways to motivate you.You are my long-awaited students, and you will do your very best in mylong-awaited Defence class. I would add some sort of dreadful threat, like‘Otherwise you will suffer horribly’, but that would be so cliched, don’t youthink? I pride myself on being more imaginative than that. Thank you.”Then the vigour and confidence seemed to drain away from Professor Quirrell. His mouth gaped open as if he had suddenly found himselffacing an unexpected audience, and he turned with a convulsive jerk andshuffled back to his seat, hunched over as if he was about to collapse inon himself and implode.“He seems a little odd,” whispered Harry.“Meh,” said the older-looking student. “You ain’t seen nothin’.”Dumbledore resumed the podium.“And now,” said Dumbledore, “before we go to bed, let us sing theschool song! Everyone pick their favourite tune and favourite words, andoff we go!”s soon as Harry opened his eyes in the Ravenclaw first-year boys’ dormitory, on the morning of his first full day at Hogwarts, he knewsomething was wrong.It was quiet.Too quiet.Oh, right… There was a Quietus Charm on his bed’s headboard, controlled by a small slider bar, which was the only reason it was ever possiblefor anyone to go to sleep in Ravenclaw.Harry sat up and looked around, expecting to see others rising for theday—The dorm, empty.The beds, rumpled and unmade.The sun, coming in at a rather high angle.His Quieter turned all the way up to maximum.And his mechanical alarm clock was still running, but the alarm wasturned off.He’d been allowed to sleep until 9:52 am, apparently. Despite his bestefforts to synchronize his 26-hour sleep cycle to his arrival at Hogwarts,he hadn’t gotten to sleep last night until around 1am. He’d been planningto wake up at 7:00am with the other students, he could stand being a littlesleep-deprived his first day so long as he got some sort of magical fix before tomorrow. But now he’d missed breakfast. And his very first class atHogwarts, in Herbology, had started one hour and twenty-two minutesago.The anger was slowly, slowly wakening in him. Oh, what a nice littleprank. Turn off his alarm. Turn up the Quieter. And let Mr. Bigshot HarryPotter miss his first class, and be blamed for being a heavy sleeper.When Harry found out who’d done this…No, this could only have been done with the cooperation of all twelveother boys in the Ravenclaw dorm. All of them would have seen his sleeping form. All of them had let him sleep through breakfast.The anger drained away, replaced by confusion and a horriblywounded feeling. They’d liked him. He’d thought. Last night, he’dthought they liked him. Why…As Harry stepped out of the bed, he saw a piece of paper facing outfrom his headboard.The paper said,My fellow Ravenclaws,It’s been an extra long day. Please let me sleep in and don’t worryabout my missing breakfast. I haven’t forgotten about my first class.Yours,Harry Potter.And Harry stood there, frozen, ice water beginning to trickle throughhis veins.The paper was in his own handwriting, in his own mechanical pencil.And he didn’t remember writing it.And… Harry squinted at the piece of paper. And unless he was imagining it, the words “I haven’t forgotten” were written in a different style,as if he was trying to tell himself something…?Had he known he was going to be Obliviated? Had he stayed up late,committed some sort of crime or covert activity, and then… but he didn’tknow the Obliviate spell… had someone else… what…A thought occurred to Harry. If he had known he was going to beObliviated…Still in his pyjamas, Harry ran around his bed to his trunk, pressed histhumb against the lock, pulled out his pouch, stuck in his hand and said“Note to myself.”And another piece of paper popped into his hand.Harry took it out, staring at it. It too was in his own handwriting.The note said:Dear Me,Please play the game. You can only play the game once in a lifetime.This is an irreplaceable opportunity.Recognition code 927, I am a potato.Yours,You.Harry nodded slowly. “Recognition code 927, I am a potato” wasindeed the message he had worked out in advance—some years earlier,while watching TV—that only he would know. If he had to identify aduplicate of himself as being really him, or something. Just in case. BePrepared.Harry couldn’t trust the message, there might be other spells involved.But it ruled out any simple prank. He had definitely written this and hedefinitely didn’t remember writing it.Staring at the paper, Harry became aware of ink showing throughfrom the other side.He flipped it over.The reverse side read:Instructions for The Game:you do not know the rules of the gameyou do not know the stakes of the gameyou do not know the objective of the gameyou do not know who controls the gameyou do not know how to end the gameYou start with 100 points.Begin.Harry stared at the “instructions”. This side wasn’t handwritten; thewriting was perfectly regular, hence artificial. It looked as if it had beeninscribed by a Quotes Quill, such as the one he’d bought to take dictation.He had absolutely no clue what was going on.Well… step one was to get dressed and eat. Maybe reverse the orderof that. His stomach felt rather empty.He’d missed breakfast, of course, but he was Prepared for that eventuality, having visualised it in advance. Harry put his hand into his pouchand said “Snack bars”, expecting to get the box of cereal bars he’d boughtbefore departing for Hogwarts.What popped up did not feel like a box of cereal bars.When Harry brought his hand into his field of vision he saw two tinycandy bars—not nearly enough for a meal—attached to a note, and thenote was inscribed in the same writing as the game instructions.The note said:Attempt failed: −1 pointCurrent points: 99Physical state: Still hungryMental state: Confused“Gleehhhhh” Harry’s mouth said without any sort of conscious intervention or decision on his part.He stood there for around a minute.One minute later, it still didn’t make any sense and he still had absolutely no idea what was going on and his brain hadn’t even begun to graspat any hypotheses like his mental hands were encased in rubber balls andcouldn’t pick anything up.His stomach, which had its own priorities, suggested a possible experimental probe.“Ah…” Harry said to the empty room. “I don’t suppose I could spend apoint and get my box of cereal bars back?”There was only silence.Harry put his hand into the pouch and said “Box of cereal bars.”A box that felt like the right shape popped up into his hand… but itwas too light, and it was open, and it was empty, and the note attached toit said:Points spent: 1Current points: 98You have gained: A box of Cereal Bars“I’d like to spend one point and get the actual cereal bars back,” saidHarry.Again, silence.Harry put his hand into the pouch and said “cereal bars”.Nothing came up.Harry shrugged despairingly and went over to the cabinet he’d beengiven near his bed, to get his wizard’s robes for the day.On the floor of the cabinet, under his robes, were the cereal bars, anda note:Points spent: 1Current points: 97You have gained: 6 cereal barsYou are still wearing: PyjamasDo not eat while you are wearing your pyjamasYou will get a Pyjama PenaltyAnd now I know that whoever controls the game is insane.“My guess is that the game is controlled by Dumbledore,” Harry saidout loud. Maybe this time he could set a new land speed record for beingquick on the uptake.Silence.But Harry was starting to pick up the pattern; the note would be inthe next place he looked. So Harry looked under his bed.Ha! Ha ha ha ha ha!Ha ha ha ha ha ha!Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!Dumbledore does not control the gameBad guessVery bad guess−20 pointsAnd you are still wearing pyjamasit is your fourth moveand you are still wearing pyjamasPyjama penalty: −2 pointsCurrent points: 75Welp, that was a puzzler, all right. It was only his first day at schooland once you ruled out Dumbledore, he didn’t know the name of anyoneelse here who was this crazy.His body more or less on autopilot, Harry gathered up a set of robesand underwear, pulled out the cavern level of his trunk (he was a very private sort of person and someone might walk into the dorm), got dressed,and then went back upstairs to put away his pyjamas.Harry paused before pulling out the cabinet drawer that held his pyjamas. If the pattern here held true…“How can I earn more points?” Harry said out loud.Then he pulled out the drawer.Opportunities to do good are everywherebut darkness is where the light needs to beCost of question: 1 pointCurrent points: 74Nice underwearDid your mother pick them out?Harry crushed the note in his hand, face flaming scarlet. Draco’scurse came back to him. Son of a mudblood—At this point he knew better than to say it out loud. He would probablyget a Profanity Penalty.Harry girded himself with his mokeskin pouch and wand. He peeledoff the wrapper of one his cereal bars and threw it into the room’s rubbishbin, where it landed atop a mostly-uneaten Chocolate Frog, a crumpledenvelope and some green and red wrapping paper. He put the other cereal bars into his mokeskin pouch.He looked around in a final, desperate, and ultimately futile searchfor clues.And then Harry left the dorm, eating as he went, in search of theSlytherin dungeons. At least that was what he thought the line was about.Trying to navigate the halls of Hogwarts was like… probably not quiteas bad as wandering around inside an Escher painting, that was the sortof thing you said for rhetorical effect rather than for its being true.A short time later, Harry was thinking that in fact an Escher painting would have both pluses and minuses compared to Hogwarts. Minuses: No consistent gravitational orientation. Pluses: At least the stairswouldn’t move around WHILE YOU WERE STILL ON THEM.Harry had originally climbed four flights of stairs to get to his dorm.After clambering down no fewer than twelve flights of stairs without getting anywhere near the dungeons, Harry had concluded that (1) an Escherpainting would be a cakewalk by comparison, (2) he was somehow higherin the castle than when he’d started, and (3) he was so thoroughly lost thathe wouldn’t have been surprised to look out of the next window and seetwo moons in the sky.Backup plan A had been to stop and ask for directions, but thereseemed to be an extreme lack of people wandering around, as if thebeggars were all attending class the way they were supposed to or something.Backup plan B…“I’m lost,” Harry said out loud. “Can, um, the spirit of the Hogwartscastle help me or something?”“I don’t think this castle has a spirit,” observed a wizened old lady inone of the paintings on the walls. “Life, perhaps, but not spirit.”There was a brief pause.“Are you—” Harry said, and then shut his mouth. On second thought,no he was NOT going to ask the painting whether it was fully consciousin the sense of being aware of its own awareness.“I’m Harry Potter,” said his mouth, more or less on autopilot. Alsomore or less automatically, Harry stuck out a hand towards the painting.The woman in the painting looked down at Harry’s hand and raisedher eyebrows.Slowly, the hand dropped back to Harry’s side.“Sorry,” Harry said, “I’m sort of new here.”“So I perceive, young raven. Where are you trying to go?”Harry hesitated. “I’m not really sure,” he said.“Then perhaps you are already there.”“Well, wherever I am trying to go, I don’t think this is it…” Harry shuthis mouth, aware of just how much he was sounding like an idiot. “Letme start over. I’m playing this game only I don’t know what the rulesare—” That didn’t really work either, did it. “Okay, third try. I’m lookingfor opportunities to do good so I can score points, and all I have is thiscryptic hint about how darkness is where the light needs to be, so I wastrying to go down but I seem to keep going up instead…”The old lady in the painting was looking at him rather sceptically.Harry sighed. “My life tends to get a bit peculiar.”“Would it be fair to say that you don’t know where you’re going or whyyou’re trying to get there?”“Entirely fair.”The old lady nodded. “I’m not sure that being lost is your most important problem, young man.”“True, but unlike the more important problems, it’s a problem I canunderstand how to solve and wow is this conversation turning into ametaphor for human existence, I didn’t even realise that was happeninguntil just now.”The lady eyed Harry appraisingly. “You are a fine young raven, aren’tyou? For a moment I was starting to wonder. Well then, as a general rule,if you keep on turning left, you’re bound to keep going down.”That sounded strangely familiar but Harry couldn’t recall where he’dheard it before. “Um… you seem like a very intelligent person. Or a picture of a very intelligent person… anyway, have you heard of a mysteriousgame where you can only play once, and they won’t tell you the rules?”“Life,” said the lady at once. “That’s one of the most obvious riddlesI’ve ever heard.”Harry blinked. “No,” he said slowly. “I mean I got an actual note andeverything saying that I had to play the game but I wouldn’t be told therules, and someone is leaving me little slips of paper telling me how manypoints I’ve lost for violating the rules, like a minus two point penalty forwearing pyjamas. Do you know anyone here at Hogwarts who’s crazyenough and powerful enough to do something like that? Besides Dumbledore, I mean?”The picture of a lady sighed. “I’m only a picture, young man. I remember Hogwarts as it was—not Hogwarts as it is. All I can tell you is that ifthis were a riddle, the answer would be that the game is life, and thatwhile we do not make all the rules ourselves, the one who awards or takespoints is always you. If it is not riddle but reality—then I do not know.”Harry bowed very low to the picture. “Thank you, milady.”The lady curtseyed to him. “I wish I could say that I’ll rememberyou with fondness,” she said, “but I probably won’t remember you at all.Farewell, Harry Potter.”He bowed again in reply, and started to climb down the nearest flightof stairs.Four left turns later he found himself staring down a corridor thatended, abruptly, in a tumbled mound of large rocks—as if there had beena cave-in, only the surrounding walls and ceiling were intact and madeof quite regular castle stones.“All right,” Harry said to the empty air, “I give up. I’m asking for another hint. How do I get to where I need to go?”“A hint! A hint, you say?”The excited voice came from a painting on the wall not far away, thisone a portrait of a middle-aged man in the loudest pink robes that Harryhad ever seen or even imagined. In the portrait he was wearing a droopyold pointed hat with a fish on it (not a drawing of a fish, mind, but a fish).“Yes!” Harry said. “A hint! A hint, I say! Only not just any hint, I’mlooking for a specific hint, it’s for a game I’m playing—”“Yes, yes! A hint for the game! You’re Harry Potter, aren’t you? I’mCornelion Flubberwalt! I was told by Erin the Consort who was told byLord Weaselnose who was told by, I forget really. But it was a messagefor me to give to you! For me! No one’s cared about me in, I don’t knowhow long, maybe ever, I’ve been stuck down here in this bloody uselessold corridor—a hint! I have your hint! It will only cost you three points!Do you want it?”“Yes! I want it!” Harry was aware that he probably ought to keep hissarcasm under control but he just couldn’t seem to help himself.“The darkness can be found between the green study rooms and McGonagall’s Transfiguration class! That’s the hint! And get a move on, you’reslower than a sack of snails! Minus ten points for being slow! Now youhave 61 points! That was the rest of the message!”“Thank you,” Harry said. He was really getting behind on the gamehere. “Um… I don’t suppose you know where the message originally camefrom, do you?”“It was spoken by a hollow voice that belled forth from a gap withinthe air itself, a gap that opened upon a fiery abyss! That’s what they toldme!”Harry was no longer sure, at this point, whether this was the sort ofthing he ought to be sceptical about, or the sort of thing he should justtake in stride. “And how can I find the line between the green study roomsand Transfiguration class?”“Just spin back around and go left, right, down, down, right, left, right,up, and left again, you’ll be at the green study room and if you go in andwalk straight out the opposite side you’ll be on a big curvy corridor thatgoes to an intersection and on the right side of that intersection will bea long straight hallway that goes to the Transfiguration classroom!” Thefigure of the middle-aged man paused. “At least that’s how it was when Iwas in Hogwarts. This is a Monday on an odd-numbered year, isn’t it?”“Pencil and mechanical paper,” Harry said to his pouch. “Er, cancelthat, paper and mechanical pencil.” He looked up. “Could you repeatthat?”After getting lost another two times, Harry felt that he was beginningto understand the basic rule for navigating the ever-changing maze thatwas Hogwarts, namely, ask a painting for directions. If this reflected somesort of incredibly deep life lesson he couldn’t figure out what it was.The green study room was a surprisingly pleasant space with sunlightstreaming in from windows of green-stained glass that showed dragonsin calm, pastoral scenes. It had chairs that looked extremely comfortable,and tables that seemed very well-suited to studying in the company ofone to three friends.Harry couldn’t actually walk straight through and out the door on theother side. There were bookshelves set into the wall, and he had to go overand read some of the titles, so as to not lose his claim to the Verres familyname. But he did it quickly, mindful of the complaint about being slow,and then went out the other side.He was walking down the “big curvy corridor” when he heard a youngboy’s voice cry out.At times like this, Harry had an excuse to sprint all-out with no regards for saving energy or doing proper warmup exercises or worryingabout crashing into things, a sudden frantic flight that nearly came to anequally sudden halt as he almost ran over a group of six first-year Hufflepuffs……who were huddled together, looking rather scared and like theydesperately wanted to do something but couldn’t figure out what, whichprobably had something to do with the group of five older Slytherins whoseemed to be surrounding another young boy.Harry was suddenly rather angry.“Excuse me!” shouted Harry at the top of his lungs.It might not have been necessary. People were already looking at him.But it certainly served to stop all the action cold.Harry walked past the cluster of Hufflepuffs towards the Slytherins.They looked down at him with expressions that ranged from anger toamusement to delight.Part of Harry’s brain was screaming in panic that these were mucholder and bigger boys who could stomp him flat.Another part said dryly that anyone caught seriously stomping theBoy-Who-Lived was in for a whole world of trouble, especially if they werea pack of older Slytherins and there were seven Hufflepuffs who saw it,and that the chance of them doing him any permanent damage in thepresence of witnesses was nearly zero. The only real weapon the olderboys had against him was his own fear, if he allowed that.Then Harry saw that the boy they had trapped was Neville Longbottom.Of course.That settled it. Harry had decided to apologise humbly to Neville andthat meant Neville was his, how dare they?Harry reached out and grabbed Neville by the wrist and yanked himout from between the Slytherins, the boy stumbling in shock as Harrypulled him out and in nearly the same motion pushed his own waythrough the same gap.And Harry stood in the center of the Slytherins where Neville hadstood, looking up at the much older, larger, and stronger boys.“Hello,” Harry said. “I’m the Boy-Who-Lived.”There was a rather awkward pause. No one seemed to know wherethe conversation was supposed to go from there.Harry’s eyes dropped downwards and saw some books and papersscattered around the floor. Oh, the old game where you let the boy tryto pick up his books and then knock them out of his hand again. Harrycouldn’t remember ever being the object of that game himself, but hehad a good imagination and his imagination was making him furious.Well, once the larger situation was resolved it would be easy enoughfor Neville to come back and pick up his materials, provided that theSlytherins stayed too intent on him to think of doing anything to thebooks.Unfortunately his straying eyes had been noted. “Ooh,” said thelargest of the boys, “did ’oo want the widdle books—”“Shut up,” Harry said coldly. Keep them off balance. Don’t do what theyexpect. Don’t fall into a pattern that calls for them to bully you. “Is this part ofsome incredibly clever plan that will gain you future advantage, or is it aspointless a disgrace to the name of Salazar Slytherin as it—”The largest boy shoved Harry Potter hard, and he went sprawling outof the circle of Slytherins onto the hard stone floor of Hogwarts.And the Slytherins laughed.Harry rose up in what seemed to him like terribly slow motion. Hedidn’t know yet how to use his wand, but there was no reason to let thatstop him, under the circumstances.“I’d like to pay as many points as it takes to get rid of this person,” Harrysaid, pointing with his finger to the largest Slytherin.Then Harry lifted his other hand, said “Abracadabra,” and snappedhis fingers.At the word Abracadabra two of the Hufflepuffs screamed, includingNeville, three other Slytherins leapt desperately out of the way of Harry’sfinger, and the largest Slytherin staggered back with an expression ofshock, a sudden splash of red decorating his face and neck and chest.Harry had not been expecting that.Slowly, the largest Slytherin reached up to his head, and peeled offthe pan of cherry pie that had just draped itself over him. The largestSlytherin held the pan in his hand for a moment, staring at it, thendropped it to the floor.It probably wasn’t the best time in the world for one of the Hufflepuffsto start laughing, but that was exactly what one of the Hufflepuffs wasdoing.Then Harry caught sight of the note on the bottom of the pan.“Hold on,” Harry said, and darted forward to pick up the note. “Thisnote’s for me, I think—”“You,” growled the largest Slytherin, “you, are, going, to—”“Look at this!” shouted Harry, brandishing the note at the olderSlytherin. “I mean, just look at this! Can you believe I’m being charged30 points for shipping and handling on one lousy pie? 30 points! I’mturning a loss on the deal even after rescuing an innocent boy in distress!And storage fees? Conveyance charges? Drayage costs? How do you getdrayage costs on a pie?”There was another one of those awkward pauses. Harry thoughtdeadly thoughts at whichever Hufflepuff couldn’t seem to stop giggling,that idiot was going to get him hurt.Harry stepped back and shot the Slytherins his best lethal glare. “Nowgo away or I will just keep making your existence more and more surrealuntil you do. Let me warn you… messing with my life tends to make yourlife… a little hairy. Get it?”In a single terrible motion, the largest Slytherin whipped his wandout to point at Harry and in the same instant was hit on the other side ofhis head by another pie, this one bright blueberry.The note on this pie was rather large and clearly readable. “You mightwant to read the note on that pie,” Harry observed. “I think it’s for youthis time.”The Slytherin slowly reached up, took the pie pan, turned it over witha wet glop that dropped more blueberry on the floor, and read a note thatsaid:NO magic may be used on the contestantwhile the Game is in progressFurther interference in the GameWILL be reported to the Game AuthoritiesThe expression of sheer bafflement on the Slytherin’s face was a lookof art. Harry thought that he might be starting to like this Game Controller.“Look,” Harry said, “you want to call it a day? I think things are spiralling out of control here. How about you go back to Slytherin and I goback to Ravenclaw and we all just cool down a bit, okay?”“I’ve got a better idea,” hissed the largest Slytherin. “How about if youaccidentally break all your fingers?”“How in Merlin’s name do you stage a believable accident after making the threat in front of a dozen witnesses, you idiot—”The largest Slytherin slowly, deliberately reached out towards Harry’shands, and Harry froze in place, the part of his brain that was noticingthe other boy’s age and strength finally managing to make itself heard,screaming, WHAT THE HECK AM I DOING?“Wait!” said one of the other Slytherins, his voice suddenly panicky.“Stop, you shouldn’t actually do that!”The largest Slytherin ignored him, taking Harry’s right hand firmlyin his left hand, and taking Harry’s index finger in his right hand.Harry stared the Slytherin straight in the eyes. Part of Harry wasscreaming, this wasn’t supposed to happen, this wasn’t allowed to happen,grownups would never let something like this actually happen—Slowly, the Slytherin started to bend his index finger backwards.He hasn’t actually broken my finger and it is beneath me to so much as flinchuntil he does. Until then, this is just another attempt to cause fear.“Stop!” said the Slytherin who had objected before. “Stop, this is avery bad idea!”“I rather agree,” said an icy voice. An older woman’s voice.The largest Slytherin let go of Harry’s hand and jumped backwards asif burned.“Professor Sprout!” cried one of the Hufflepuffs, sounding as glad asanyone Harry had ever heard in his life.Into Harry’s field of vision, as he turned, stalked a dumpy littlewoman with messily curled grey hair and clothes covered with dirt. Shepointed an accusing finger at the Slytherins. “Explain yourselves,” shesaid. “What are you doing with my Hufflepuffs and…” she looked at him.“My fine student, Harry Potter.”Uh oh. That’s right, it was HER class I missed this morning.“He threatened to kill us!” blurted one of the other Slytherins, thesame one who’d called for a halt.“What?” Harry said blankly. “I did not! If I was going to kill you Iwouldn’t make public threats first!”A third Slytherin laughed helplessly and then stopped abruptly as theother boys shot him deadly glares.Professor Sprout had adopted a rather sceptical expression. “Whatdeath threat would this be, exactly?”“The Killing Curse! He pretended to use the Killing Curse on us!”Professor Sprout turned to look at Harry. “Yes, quite a terrible threatfrom an eleven-year-old boy. Though still not something you should everdream of pretending, Harry Potter.”“I don’t even know the words to the Killing Curse,” Harry saidpromptly. “And I didn’t have my wand out at any time.”Now Professor Sprout was giving Harry a sceptical look. “I supposethis boy hit himself with two pies, then.”“He didn’t use his wand!” blurted one of the young Hufflepuffs. “Idon’t know how he did it either, he just snapped his fingers and therewas pie!”“Really,” said Professor Sprout after a pause. She drew her own wand.“I won’t require it, since you do seem to be the victim here, but would youmind if I checked your wand to verify that?”Harry took out his wand. “What do I—”“Prior Incantato,” said Sprout. She frowned. “That’s odd, your wanddoesn’t seem to have been used at all.”Harry shrugged. “It hasn’t, actually, I only got my wand and schoolbooks a few days ago.”Sprout nodded. “Then we have a clear case of accidental magic froma boy who felt threatened. And the rules plainly state that you are not tobe held responsible. As for you…” she turned to the Slytherins. Her eyesdropped deliberately to Neville’s books lying on the floor.There was a long silence during which she looked at the fiveSlytherins.“Three points from Slytherin, each,” she said finally. “And six fromhim,” pointing to the boy covered in pie. “Don’t you ever meddle with myHufflepuffs again, or my student Harry Potter either. Now go.”She didn’t have to repeat herself; the Slytherins turned and walkedaway very quickly.Neville went and started picking up his books. He seemed to be crying, but only a little. It might have been from delayed shock, or it mighthave been because the other boys were helping him.“Thank you very much, Harry Potter,” Professor Sprout said to him.“Seven points to Ravenclaw, one for each Hufflepuff you helped protect.And I won’t say anything more.”Harry blinked. He’d been expecting something more along the linesof a lecture about keeping himself out of trouble, and a rather severescolding for missing his very first class.Maybe he should have gone to Hufflepuff. Sprout was cool.“Scourgify,” Sprout said to the mess of pie on the floor, which promptlyvanished.And she left, walking along the hall that led to the green study room.“How did you do that?” hissed one of the Hufflepuff boys as soon asshe was gone.Harry smiled smugly. “I can make anything I want happen just bysnapping my fingers.”The boy’s eyes widened. “Really?”“No,” said Harry. “But when you’re telling everyone this story be sureto share it with Hermione Granger in first-year Ravenclaw, she has ananecdote you might find amusing.” He had absolutely no clue what washappening, but he wasn’t about to pass up the opportunity to add to hisgrowing legend. “Oh, and what was all that about the Killing Curse?”The boy gave him a strange look. “You really don’t know?”“If I did, I wouldn’t be asking.”“The words to the Killing Curse are,” the boy swallowed, and his voicedropped to a whisper, and he held his hands away from his sides as if tomake it very clear that he wasn’t holding a wand, “Avada Kedavra.”Well of course they are.Harry put this on his growing list of things to never ever tell his Dad,Professor Michael Verres-Evans. It was bad enough talking about howyou were the only person to survive the fearsome Killing Curse, withouthaving to admit that the Killing Curse was “Abracadabra.”“I see,” Harry said after a pause. “Well, that’s the last time I ever saythat before snapping my fingers.” Though it had produced an effect thatmight be tactically useful.“Why did you—”“Raised by Muggles, Muggles think it’s a joke and that it’s funny. Seriously, that’s what happened. Sorry, but can you remind me of yourname?”“I’m Ernie Macmillan,” said the Hufflepuff. He held out his hand, andHarry shook it. “Honoured to meet you.”Harry executed a slight bow. “Pleased to meet you, skip the honouredthing.”Then the other boys crowded round him and there was a sudden floodof introductions.When they were done, Harry swallowed. This was going to be verydifficult. “Um… if everyone would excuse me… I have something to say toNeville—”All eyes turned to Neville, who took a step back, his face looking apprehensive.“I suppose,” Neville said in a tiny voice, “you’re going to say I should’vebeen braver—”“Oh, no, nothing like that!” Harry said hastily. “Nothing to do withthat. It’s just, um, something the Sorting Hat told me—”Suddenly the other boys looked very interested, except for Neville,who was looking even more apprehensive.There seemed to be something blocking Harry’s throat. He knew heshould just blurt it out, and it was like he’d swallowed a large brick thatwas just stuck in the way.It was like Harry had to manually take control of his lips and produceeach syllable individually, but he managed to make it happen. “I’m, sor,ry.” He exhaled and took a deep breath. “For what I did, um, the otherday. You… don’t have to be gracious about it or anything, I’ll understandif you just hate me. This isn’t about me trying to look cool by apologisingor your having to accept it. What I did was wrong.”There was a pause.Neville clutched his books tighter to his chest. “Why did you do it?” hesaid in a thin, wavering voice. He blinked, as if trying to hold back tears.“Why does everyone do that to me, even the Boy-Who-Lived?”Harry suddenly felt smaller than he ever had in his life. “I’m sorry,”Harry said again, his voice now hoarsened. “It’s just… you looked soscared, it was like a sign over your head saying ‘victim’, and I wantedto show you that things don’t always turn out badly, that sometimes themonsters give you chocolate… I thought if I showed you that, you mightrealise there wasn’t so much to be afraid of—”“But there is,” whispered Neville. “You saw it today, there is!”“They wouldn’t have done anything really bad in front of witnesses.Their main weapon is fear. That’s why they target you, because they cansee you’re afraid. I wanted to make you less afraid… show you that thefear was worse than the thing itself… or that was what I told myself, butthe Sorting Hat told me that I was lying to myself and that I really did itbecause it was fun. So that’s why I’m apologising—”“You hurt me,” said Neville. “Just now. When you grabbed me andpulled me away from them.” Neville held out his arm and pointed towhere Harry had grabbed him. “I might have a bruise here later fromhow hard you pulled. You hurt me worse than anything the Slytherinsdid by bumping into me, actually.”“Neville!” hissed Ernie. “He was trying to save you!”“I’m sorry,” whispered Harry. “When I saw that I just got… really angry…”Neville looked at him steadily. “So you yanked me out really hard andput yourself in where I was and went, ‘Hello, I’m the Boy-Who-Lived’.”Harry nodded.“I think you’re going to be really cool someday,” Neville said. “Butright now, you’re not.”Harry swallowed the sudden knot in his throat and walked away. Hecontinued down the corridor to the intersection, then turned left into ahallway and kept on walking, blindly.What was he supposed to do here? Never get angry? He wasn’t surehe could have done anything without being angry and who knows whatwould have happened to Neville and his books then. Besides, Harry hadread enough fantasy books to know how this one went. He would try tosuppress the anger and he would fail and it would keep coming out again.And after this whole long journey of self-discovery he would learn at theend that his anger was a part of himself and that only by accepting itcould he learn to use it wisely. Star Wars was the only universe in whichthe answer actually was that you were supposed to cut yourself off com*pletely from negative emotions, and something about Yoda had alwaysmade Harry hate the little green moron.So the obvious time-saving plan was to skip the journey of selfdiscovery and go straight to the part where he realised that only byaccepting his anger as a part of himself could he stay in control of it.The problem was that he didn’t feel out of control when he was angry.The cold rage made him feel like he was in control. It was only when helooked back that events as a whole seemed to have… blown up out of control,somehow.He wondered how much the Game Controller cared about that sort ofthing, and whether he’d won or lost points for it. Harry himself felt likehe’d lost quite a few points, and he was sure the old lady in the picturewould have told him that his was the only opinion that mattered.And Harry was also wondering whether the Game Controller had sentProfessor Sprout. It was the logical thought: the note had threatened tonotify the Game Authorities, and then there Professor Sprout was. MaybeProfessor Sprout was the Game Controller—the Head of House Hufflepuffwould be the last person anyone would suspect, which ought to put hernear the top of Harry’s list. He’d read one or two mystery novels, too.“So how am I doing in the game?” Harry said out loud.A sheet of paper flew over his head, as if someone had thrown it frombehind him—Harry turned around, but there was no one there—andwhen Harry turned forwards again, the note was settling to the floor.The note said:Points for style: 10Points for good thinking: −3,000,000Ravenclaw House points bonus: 70Current points: −2,999,871Turns remaining: 2“Minus three million points?” Harry said indignantly to the empty hallway. “That seems excessive! I want to file an appeal with the Game Authorities! And how am I supposed to make up three million points in thenext two turns?”Another note flew over his head.Appeal: FailedAsking the wrong questions: −1,000,000,000,000 pointsCurrent points: −1,000,002,999,871Turns remaining: 1Harry gave up. With one turn remaining all he could do was take hisbest shot, even if it wasn’t very good. “My guess is that the game represents life.”A final sheet of paper flew over his head, reading:Attempt failedFailed Failed FailedAiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeeeeeCurrent points: minus InfinityFinal instruction:go to Professor McGonagall’s officeThe last line was in his own handwriting.Harry stared at the last line for a while, then shrugged. Fine. Professor McGonagall’s office it would be. If she was the Game Controller…Okay, honestly, Harry had absolutely no idea how he would feel if Professor McGonagall was the Game Controller. His mind was just drawinga complete blank. It was, literally, unimaginable.A couple of portraits later—it wasn’t a long trip, Professor McGonagall’s office wasn’t far from her Transfiguration classroom, at least noton Mondays on odd-numbered years—Harry stood outside the door toher office.He knocked.“Come in,” said Professor McGonagall’s muffled voice.He entered.ome in,” said Professor McGonagall’s muffled voice.Harry did so.The office of the Deputy Headmistress was clean and well-organised;on the wall immediately adjacent to the desk was a maze of woodencubbyholes of all shapes and sizes, most with several parchment scrollsthrust into them, and it was somehow very clear that Professor McGonagall knew exactly what every cubbyhole meant, even if no one else did.A single parchment lay on the actual desk, which was, aside from that,clean. Behind the desk was a closed door barred with several locks.Professor McGonagall was sitting on a backless stool behind the desk,looking puzzled—her eyes had widened, with perhaps a slight note of apprehension, as she saw Harry.“Mr. Potter?” said Professor McGonagall. “What is this about?”Harry’s mind went blank. He’d been instructed by the game to comehere, he had been expecting her to have something in mind…“Mr. Potter?” said Professor McGonagall, starting to look slightly annoyed.Thankfully, Harry’s panicking brain remembered at this point that hedid have something he’d been planning to discuss with Professor McGonagall. Something important and well worth her time.“Um…” Harry said. “If there are any spells you can cast to make sureno one’s listening to us…”Professor McGonagall stood up from her chair, firmly closed the outerdoor, and began taking out her wand and saying spells.It was at this point that Harry realised he was faced with a pricelessand possibly irreplaceable opportunity to offer Professor McGonagall aComed-Tea and he couldn’t believe he was seriously thinking that and itwould be fine the soda would vanish after a few seconds and he told thatpart of himself to shut up.It did, and Harry began to organise mentally what he was going to say.He hadn’t planned to have this discussion quite so soon, but so long as hewas here…Professor McGonagall finished a spell that sounded a lot older thanLatin, and then she sat down again.“All right,” she said in a quiet voice. “No one’s listening.” Her face wasrather tight.Oh, right, she’s expecting me to blackmail her for information about theprophecy.Eh, Harry’d get around to that some other day.“It’s about the Incident with the Sorting Hat,” Harry said. (Professor McGonagall blinked.) “Um… I think there’s an extra spell on the Sorting Hat, something that the Sorting Hat itself doesn’t know about, something that triggers when the Sorting Hat says Slytherin. I heard a message that I’m pretty sure Ravenclaws aren’t supposed to hear. It camethe moment the Sorting Hat was off my head and I felt the connectionbreak. It sounded like a hiss and like English at the same time,” therewas a sharp intake of breath from McGonagall, “and it said: Salutationsfrom Slytherin to Slytherin, if you would seek my secrets, speak to mysnake.”Professor McGonagall sat there with her mouth open, staring atHarry as if he’d grown another two heads.“So…” Professor McGonagall said slowly, as though she couldn’t believe the words that were coming out of her own lips, “you decided tocome to me right away and tell me about it.”“Well, yes, of course,” Harry said. There was no need to admit howlong it had taken him to actually think of that. “As opposed to, say, tryingto research it myself, or telling any of the other children.”“I… see,” Professor McGonagall said. “And if, perhaps, you were to discover the entrance to Salazar Slytherin’s legendary Chamber of Secrets,an entrance that you and you alone could open…”“I would close the entrance and report to you at once so that a teamof experienced magical archaeologists could be assembled,” Harry saidpromptly. “Then I would open up the entrance again and they would goin very carefully to make sure that there was nothing dangerous. I mightgo in later to look around, or if they needed me to open up somethingelse, but it would be after the area had been declared clear and they hadphotographs of how everything looked before people started trompingaround their priceless historical site.”Professor McGonagall sat there with her mouth open, staring at himlike he’d just turned into a cat.“It’s obvious if you’re not a Gryffindor,” Harry said kindly.“I think,” Professor McGonagall said in a rather choked voice, “thatyou far underestimate the rarity of common sense, Mr. Potter.”That sounded about right. Although… “A Hufflepuff would’ve said thesame thing.”McGonagall paused, struck. “That’s true.”“Sorting Hat offered me Hufflepuff.”She blinked at him as though she couldn’t believe her own ears. “Didit really?”“Yes.”“Mr. Potter,” McGonagall said, and now her voice was low, “fivedecades ago was the last time a student died within the walls of Hogwarts, and I am now certain that five decades ago was the last timesomeone heard that message.”A chill went through Harry. “Then I will be very sure to take no actionwhatsoever on this matter without consulting you, Professor McGonagall.”He paused. “And may I suggest that you get together the best people youcan find and see if it’s possible to get that extra spell off the Sorting Hat…and if you can’t do that, maybe put on another spell, a Quietus that brieflyactivates just as the Hat is being removed from a student’s head, thatmight work as a patch. There, no more dead students.” Harry noddedin satisfaction.Professor McGonagall looked even more stunned, if such a thing wereimaginable. “I cannot possibly award you enough points for this withoutgiving the House Cup to Ravenclaw outright.”“Um,” Harry said. “Um. I’d rather not earn that many House points.”Now Professor McGonagall was giving him a strange look. “Why not?”Harry was having a little difficulty putting it into words. “Because itwould be just too sad, you know? Like… like back when I was still trying togo to school in the Muggle world, and whenever there was a group project,I’d go ahead and do the whole thing myself because the others would onlyslow me down. I’m fine with earning lots of points, more than anyone elseeven, but if I earn enough to be decisive in winning the House Cup just bymyself, then it’s like I’m carrying House Ravenclaw on my back and that’stoo sad.”“I see…” McGonagall said hesitantly. It was apparent that this way ofthinking had never occurred to her. “Suppose I only awarded you fiftypoints, then?”Harry shook his head again. “It’s not fair to the other children if Iearn lots of points for grownup things that I can be part of and they can’t.How is Terry Boot supposed to earn fifty points for reporting a whisperhe heard from the Sorting Hat? It wouldn’t be fair at all.”“I see why the Sorting Hat offered you Hufflepuff,” said ProfessorMcGonagall. She was eyeing him with a strange respect.That made Harry choke up a bit. He’d honestly thought he wasn’t worthy of Hufflepuff. That the Sorting Hat had just been trying to shove himanywhere but Ravenclaw, into a House whose virtues he didn’t have…Professor McGonagall was smiling now. “And if I tried to give you tenpoints…?”“Are you going to explain where those ten points came from, if anyoneasks? There might be a lot of Slytherins, and I don’t mean the children atHogwarts, who would be really really angry if they knew about the spellbeing taken off the Sorting Hat and found out I was involved. So I thinkthat absolute secrecy is the better part of valour. No need to thank me,ma’am, virtue is its own reward.”“So it is,” Professor McGonagall said, “but I do have a very specialsomething else to give you. I see that I have greatly wronged you in mythoughts, Mr. Potter. Please wait here.”She got up, went over to the locked back door, waved her wand, and asort of blurry curtain sprang up around her. Harry could neither see norhear what was going on. It was a few minutes later that the blur vanishedand Professor McGonagall was standing there, facing him, with the doorbehind her looking as though it hadn’t ever been opened.And Professor McGonagall held out in one hand a necklace, a thingolden chain bearing in its center a silver circle, within which was thedevice of an hourglass. In her other hand was a folded pamphlet. “This isfor you,” she said.Wow! He was going to get some sort of neat magical item as a questreward! Apparently that business with refusing offers of monetary rewards until you got a magic item actually worked in real life, not just computer games.Harry accepted his new necklace, smiling. “What is it?”Professor McGonagall took a breath. “Mr. Potter, this is an item whichis ordinarily lent only to children who have already shown themselves tobe highly responsible, in order to help them with difficult class schedules.”McGonagall hesitated, as though about to add something else. “I mustemphasise, Mr. Potter, that this item’s true nature is secret and that youmust not tell any of the other students about it, or let them see you usingit. If that’s not acceptable to you, then you can give it back now.”“I can keep secrets,” Harry said. “So what does it do?”“So far as the other students are concerned, this is a Spimster wicketand it is used to treat a rare, non-contagious magical ailment called Spontaneous Duplication. You wear it under your clothes, and while you haveno reason to show it to anyone, you also have no reason to treat it as anawful secret. Spimster wickets are not interesting. Do you understand,Mr. Potter?”Harry nodded, his smile widening. He sensed the work of a competentSlytherin. “And what does it really do?”“It’s a Time-Turner. Each spin of the hourglass sends you one hourback in time. So if you use it to go back two hours every day, you shouldalways be able to get to sleep at the same time.”Harry’s suspension of disbelief blew completely out the window.You’re giving me a time machine to treat my sleep disorder.You’re giving me a TIME MACHINE to treat my SLEEP DISORDER.“Ehehehehhheheh…” Harry’s mouth said. He was now holding thenecklace away from him as though it were a live bomb. Well, no, not asif it were a live bomb, that didn’t begin to describe the severity of the situation. Harry held the necklace away from him as though it were a timemachine.Say, Professor McGonagall, did you know that time-reversed ordinary matterlooks just like antimatter? Why yes it does! Did you know that one kilogram ofantimatter encountering one kilogram of matter will annihilate in an explosionequivalent to 43 million tons of TNT? Do you realise that I myself weigh 41 kilograms and that the resulting blast would leave A GIANT SMOKING CRATER“Excuse me,” Harry managed to say, “but this sounds really really really REALLY DANGEROUS!” Harry’s voice didn’t quite rise to a shriek, hecouldn’t possibly scream loud enough to do this situation justice so therewas no point in trying.Professor McGonagall looked upon him with tolerant affection. “I’mglad you’re taking this seriously, Mr. Potter, but Time-Turners aren’t thatdangerous. We wouldn’t give them to children if they were.”“Really,” Harry said. “Ahahahaha. Of course you wouldn’t give timemachines to children if they were dangerous, what was I thinking? Sojust to be clear, sneezing on this device will not send me into the MiddleAges where I will run over Gutenberg with a horse cart and prevent theEnlightenment? Because, you know, I hate it when that happens to me.”McGonagall’s lips were twitching in that way she had when she wastrying not to smile. She offered Harry the pamphlet she was holding, butHarry was carefully holding out the necklace with both hands and staringat the hourglass to make sure it wasn’t about to turn. “Don’t worry,” McGonagall said after a momentary pause, when it became clear that Harrywasn’t going to move, “that can’t possibly happen, Mr. Potter. The TimeTurner cannot be used to move more than six hours backwards. It can’tbe used more than six times in any day.”“Oh, good, very good, that. And if someone bumps into me the TimeTurner will not break and will not trap the whole castle of Hogwarts in anendlessly repeating loop of Thursdays.”“Well, they can be fragile…” said McGonagall. “And I do think I’veheard about strange things happening if they’re broken. But nothing likethat!”“Perhaps,” Harry said when he could speak again, “you ought to provide your time machines with some sort of protective shell, rather than leaving the glass exposed, so as to prevent that from happening.”McGonagall looked quite struck. “That’s an excellent idea, Mr. Potter.I shall inform the Ministry of it.”That’s it, it’s official now, they’ve ratified it in Parliament, everyone in thewizarding world is completely stupid.“And while I hate to get all PHILOSOPHICAL,” Harry desperately triedto lower his voice to something under a shriek, “has anyone thought aboutthe IMPLICATIONS of going back six hours and doing something thatchanges time which would pretty much DELETE ALL THE PEOPLE AFFECTED and REPLACE THEM WITH DIFFERENT VERSIONS—”“Oh, you can’t change time!” Professor McGonagall interrupted.“Good heavens, Mr. Potter, do you think these would be allowed studentsif that was possible? What if someone tried to change their test scores?”Harry took a moment to process this. His hands relaxed, just a little,from their white grip on the hourglass chain. Like he wasn’t holding atime machine, just a live nuclear warhead.“So…” Harry said slowly. “People just find that the universe… happensto be self-consistent, somehow, even though it has time-travel in it. IfI and my future self interact then I’ll see the same thing as both of me,even though, on my own first run through, my future self is already acting in full knowledge of things that, from my own perspective, haven’thappened yet…” Harry’s voice trailed off into the inadequacy of English.“Correct, I think,” said Professor McGonagall. “Although wizards areadvised to avoid being seen by their past selves. If you’re attending twoclasses at the same time and you need to cross paths with yourself, forexample, the first version of you should step aside and close his eyes at aknown time—you have a watch already, good—so that the future you canpass. It’s all there in the pamphlet.”“Ahahahaa. And what happens when someone ignores that advice?”Professor McGonagall pursed her lips. “I understand that it can bequite disconcerting.”“And it doesn’t, say, create a paradox that destroys the universe.”She smiled tolerantly. “Mr. Potter, I think I’d remember hearing ifthat had ever happened.”Professor McGonagall actually laughed. It was a pleasant, glad soundthat seemed surprisingly out of place on that stern face. “You’re havinganother ‘you turned into a cat’ moment, aren’t you, Mr. Potter. You probably don’t want to hear this, but it’s quite endearingly cute.”“Turning into a cat doesn’t even BEGIN to compare to this. You knowright up until this moment I had this awful suppressed thought somewhere in the back of my mind that the only remaining answer was thatmy whole universe was a computer simulation like in the book Simulacron3 but now even that is ruled out because this little toy ISN’T TURING COMPUTABLE! A Turing machine could simulate going back into a definedmoment of the past and computing a different future from there, an oracle machine could rely on the halting behavior of lower-order machines,but what you’re saying is that reality somehow self-consistently computesin one sweep using information that hasn’t… happened… yet…”Realisation struck Harry a pile-driver blow.It all made sense now. It all finally made sense.“SO THAT’S HOW THE COMED-TEA WORKS! Of course! The spelldoesn’t force funny events to happen, it just makes you feel an impulse todrink right before funny things are going to happen anyway! I’m such afool, I should have realised when I felt the impulse to drink the ComedTea before Dumbledore’s second speech, didn’t drink it, and then chokedon my own saliva instead—drinking the Comed-Tea doesn’t cause thecomedy, the comedy causes you to drink the Comed-Tea! I saw the twoevents were correlated and assumed the Comed-Tea had to be the causeand the comedy had to be the effect because I thought temporal orderrestrained causation and causal graphs had to be acyclic BUT IT ALLRealisation struck Harry the second pile-driver.This one he managed to keep quiet, making only a small stranglingsound like a dying kitten as he realised who’d put the note on his bed thismorning.Professor McGonagall’s eyes were alight. “After you graduate, or possibly even before, you really must teach some of these Muggle theories atHogwarts, Mr. Potter. They sound quite fascinating, even if they’re allwrong.”“Glehhahhh…”Professor McGonagall offered him a few more pleasantries, demanded a few more promises to which Harry nodded, said somethingabout not talking to snakes where anyone could hear him, reminded himto read the pamphlet, and then somehow Harry found himself standingoutside her office with the door closed firmly behind him.“Gaahhhrrrraa…” Harry said.Why yes his mind was blown.Not least by the fact that, if not for the Prank, he might well have neverobtained a Time-Turner in the first place.Or would Professor McGonagall have given it to him anyway, onlylater in the day, whenever he got around to asking about his sleep disorder or telling her about the Sorting Hat’s message? And would he, atthat time, have wanted to pull a prank on himself which would have ledto him getting the Time-Turner earlier? So that the only self-consistent possibility was the one in which the Prank started before he even woke up inthe morning…?Harry found himself considering, for the first time in his life, that theanswer to his question might be literally inconceivable. That since his ownbrain contained neurons that only ran forwards in time, there was nothinghis brain could do, no operation it could perform, which was conjugateto the operation of a Time Turner.Up until this point Harry had lived by the admonition of E. T. Jaynesthat if you were ignorant about a phenomenon, that was a fact about yourown state of mind, not a fact about the phenomenon itself; that your uncertainty was a fact about you, not a fact about whatever you were uncertain about; that ignorance existed in the mind, not in reality; that ablank map did not correspond to a blank territory. There were mysterious questions, but a mysterious answer was a contradiction in terms. Aphenomenon could be mysterious to some particular person, but therecould be no phenomena mysterious of themselves. To worship a sacredmystery was just to worship your own ignorance.So Harry had looked upon magic and refused to be intimidated.People had no sense of history, they learned about chemistry and biologyand astronomy and thought that these matters had always been theproper meat of science, that they had never been mysterious. The starshad once been mysteries. Lord Kelvin had once called the nature of lifeand biology—the response of muscles to human will and the generationof trees from seeds—a mystery “infinitely beyond” the reach of science.(Not just a little beyond, mind you, but infinitely beyond. Lord Kelvincertainly had felt a huge emotional charge from not knowing something.)Every mystery ever solved had been a puzzle from the dawn of the humanspecies right up until someone solved it.Now, for the first time, he was up against the prospect of a mysterythat was threatening to be permanent. If Time didn’t work by acycliccausal networks then Harry didn’t understand what was meant by causeand effect; and if Harry didn’t understand causes and effects then hedidn’t understand what sort of stuff reality might be made of instead;and it was entirely possible that his human mind never could understand,because his brain was made of old-fashioned linear-time neurons, and thishad turned out to be an impoverished subset of reality.On the plus side, the Comed-Tea, which had once seemed all-powerfuland all-unbelievable, had turned out to have a much simpler explanation.Which he’d missed merely because the truth was completely outside hishypothesis space or anything that his brain had evolved to comprehend.But now he actually had figured it, probably. Which was sort of encouraging. Sort of.Harry glanced down at his watch. It was nearly 11am, he’d gotten tosleep last night at 1am, so in the natural state of affairs he’d go to sleeptonight at 3am. So to go to sleep at 10pm and wake up at 7am, he shouldgo back five hours total. Which meant that if he wanted to get back tohis dorm at around 6am, before anyone was awake, he’d better hurry upand…Even in retrospect Harry didn’t understand how he’d pulled off half thestuff involved in the Prank. Where had the pie come from?Harry was starting to seriously fear time travel.On the other hand, he had to admit that it had been an irreplaceableopportunity. A prank you could only pull on yourself once in a lifetime,within six hours of when you first found out about Time-Turners.In fact that was even more puzzling, when Harry thought about it.Time had presented him with the finished Prank as a fait accompli, andyet it was, quite clearly, his own handiwork. Concept and execution andwriting style. Every last part, even the ones he still didn’t understand.Well, time was a-wasting and there were at most thirty hours in a day.Harry did know some of what he had to do, and he might figure out therest, like the pie, while he was working. There was no point putting it off.He couldn’t exactly accomplish anything stuck here in the future.Five hours earlier, Harry was sneaking into his dorm with his robes pulledup over his head as a thin sort of disguise, just in case someone was already up and about and saw him at the same time as Harry lying in hisbed. He didn’t want to have to explain to anyone about his little medicalproblem with Spontaneous Duplication.Fortunately it seemed that everyone was still asleep.And there also seemed to be a box, wrapped in red and green paperwith a bright golden ribbon, lying next to his bed. The perfect, stereotypical image of a Christmas present, although it wasn’t Christmas.Harry crept in as softly as he could manage, just in case someone hadtheir Quieter turned down low.There was an envelope attached to the box, closed by plain clear waxwithout a seal impressed.Harry carefully pried the envelope open, and took out the letter inside.The letter said:This is the Cloak of Invisibility of Ignotus Peverell, passed down throughhis descendants the Potters. Unlike lesser cloaks and spells it has the powerto keep you hidden, not merely invisible. Your father lent it to me to studyshortly before he died, and I confess that I have received much good use ofit over the years.In the future I shall have to get along with Disillusionment, I fear. Itis time the Cloak was returned to you, its heir. I had thought to make thisa Christmas present, but it wished to come back to your hand before then.It seems to expect you to have need of it. Use it well.No doubt you are already thinking of all manner of wonderful pranks,as your father committed in his day. If his full misdeeds were known, everywoman in Gryffindor would gather to desecrate his grave. I shall not try tostop history from repeating, but be MOST careful not to reveal yourself. IfDumbledore saw a chance to possess one of the Deathly Hallows, he wouldnever let it escape his grasp until the day he died.A Very Merry Christmas to you.The note was unsigned.“Hold on,” Harry said, pulling up short as the other boys were about toleave the Ravenclaw dorm. “Sorry, there’s something else I’ve got to dowith my trunk. I’ll be along to breakfast in a couple of minutes.”Terry Boot scowled at Harry. “You’d better not be planning to gothrough any of our things.”Harry held up one hand. “I swear that I intend to do nothing of thesort to any of your things, that I only intend to access objects that I myself own, that I have no pranking or otherwise questionable intentionstowards any of you, and that I do not anticipate those intentions changing before I get to breakfast in the Great Hall.”Terry frowned. “Wait, is that—”“Don’t worry,” said Penelope Clearwater, who was there to guidethem. “There were no loopholes. Well-worded, Potter, you should be alawyer.”Harry Potter blinked at that. Ah, yes, Ravenclaw prefect. “Thank you,”he said. “I think.”“When you try to find the Great Hall, you will get lost.” Penelopestated this in the tones of a flat, unarguable fact. “As soon as you do, ask aportrait how to get to the first floor. Ask another portrait the instant yoususpect you might be lost again. Especially if it seems like you’re goingup higher and higher. If you are higher than the whole castle ought to be,stop and wait for search parties. Otherwise we shall see you again fourmonths later and you will be five months older and dressed in a loinclothand covered in snow and that’s if you stay inside the castle.”“Understood,” said Harry, swallowing hard. “Um, shouldn’t you tellstudents all that sort of stuff right away?”Penelope sighed. “What, all of it? That would take weeks. You’ll pick itup as you go along.” She turned to go, followed by the other students. “IfI don’t see you at breakfast in thirty minutes, Potter, I’ll start the search.”Once everyone was gone, Harry attached the note to his bed—he’d already written it and all the other notes, working in his cavern level beforeeveryone else woke up. Then he carefully reached inside the Quietus fieldand pulled the Cloak of Invisibility off Harry-1’s still-sleeping form.And just for the sake of mischief, Harry put the Cloak into Harry-1’spouch, knowing it would thereby already be in his own.“I can see that the message is passed on to Cornelion Flubberwalt,” saidthe painting of a man with aristocratic airs and, in fact, a perfectly normalnose. “But might I ask where it came from originally?”Harry shrugged with artful helplessness. “I was told that it was spoken by a hollow voice that belled forth from a gap within the air itself, agap that opened upon a fiery abyss.”“Hey!” Hermione said in tones of indignation from her place on the otherside of the breakfast table. “That’s everyone’s dessert! You can’t just takeone whole pie and put it in your pouch!”“I’m not taking one pie, I’m taking two. Sorry everyone, gotta runnow!” Harry ignored the cries of outrage and left the Great Hall. Heneeded to arrive at Herbology class a little early.Professor Sprout eyed him sharply. “And how do you know what theSlytherins are planning?”“I can’t name my source,” Harry said. “In fact I have to ask you to pretend that this conversation never happened. Just act like you happenedacross them naturally while you were on an errand, or something. I’llrun on ahead as soon as Herbology gets out. I think I can distract theSlytherins until you get there. I’m not easy to scare or bully, and I don’tthink they’ll dare to seriously hurt the Boy-Who-Lived. Though… I’m notasking you to run in the hallways, but I would appreciate it if you didn’tdawdle along the way.”Professor Sprout looked at him for a long moment, then her expression softened. “Please be careful with yourself, Harry Potter. And… thankyou.”“Just be sure not to be late,” Harry said. “And remember, when youget there, you weren’t expecting to see me and this conversation neverhappened.”It was horrible, watching himself yank Neville out of the circle ofSlytherins. Neville had been right, he’d used too much force, way toomuch force.180 *“Hello,” Harry Potter said coldly. “I’m the Boy-Who-Lived.”Eight first-year boys, mostly the same height. One of them had a scaron his forehead and he wasn’t acting like the others.Oh wad some power the giftie gie usTo see oursel’s as others see us!It wad frae monie a blunder free us,And foolish notion—Professor McGonagall was right. The Sorting Hat was right. It wasclear once you saw it from the outside.There was something wrong with Harry Potter.rigideiro!”Harry dipped a finger in the glass of water on his desk. It shouldhave been cool. But lukewarm it was, and lukewarm it had stayed. Again.Harry was feeling very, very cheated.There were hundreds of fantasy novels scattered around the Verreshousehold. Harry had read quite a few. And it was starting to look like hehad a mysterious dark side. So after the glass of water had refused to cooperate the first few times, Harry had glanced around the Charms classroom to make sure no one was watching, and then taken a deep breath,concentrated, and made himself angry. Thought about the Slytherins bullying Neville, and the game where someone knocked down your booksevery time you tried to pick them up again. Thought about what DracoMalfoy had said about the ten-year-old Lovegood girl and how the Wizengamot really operated…And the fury had entered his blood, he had held out his wand in a handthat trembled with hate and said in cold tones “Frigideiro!” and absolutelynothing had happened.Harry had been gypped. He wanted to write someone and demanda refund on his dark side which clearly ought to have irresistible magicalpower but had turned out to be defective.“Frigideiro!” said Hermione again from the desk next to him. Her water was solid ice and there were white crystals forming on the rim of herglass. She seemed to be totally intent on her own work and not at all conscious of the other students staring at her with hateful eyes, which was either (a) dangerously oblivious of her or (b) a perfectly honed performancerising to the level of fine art.“Oh, very good, Miss Granger!” squeaked Filius Flitwick, their CharmsProfessor and Head of Ravenclaw, a tiny little man with no visible signsof being a past dueling champion. “Excellent! Stupendous!”Harry had expected to be, in the worst case, second behind Hermione.Harry would have preferred for her to be rivalling him, of course, but hecould have accepted it the other way around.As of Monday, Harry was headed for the bottom of the class, a positionfor which he was companionably rivalling all the other Muggle-raised students except Hermione. Who was all alone and rivalless at the top, poorthing.Professor Flitwick was standing over the desk of one of the other Muggleborns and quietly adjusting the way she was holding her wand.Harry looked over at Hermione. He swallowed hard. It was the obvious role for her in the scheme of things… “Hermione?” Harry said tentatively. “Do you have any idea what I might be doing wrong?”Hermione’s eyes lit up with a terrible light of helpfulness and something in the back of Harry’s brain screamed in desperate humiliation.Five minutes later, Harry’s water did seem noticeably cooler thanroom temperature and Hermione had given him a few verbal pats on thehead and told him to pronounce it more carefully next time and gone offto help someone else.Professor Flitwick had given her a House point for helping him.Harry was gritting his teeth so hard his jaw ached and that wasn’thelping his pronunciation.I don’t care if it’s unfair competition. I know exactly what I am doing with twoextra hours every day. I am going to sit in my trunk and study until I am keepingup with Hermione Granger.“Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic youwill learn at Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. There was no trace ofany levity upon the face of the stern old witch. “Anyone messing aroundin my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned.”Her wand came down and tapped her desk, which smoothly reshapeditself into a pig. A couple of Muggleborn students gave out small yelps.The pig looked around and snorted, seeming confused, and then becamea desk again.The Transfiguration Professor looked around the classroom, andthen her eyes settled on one student.“Mr. Potter,” said Professor McGonagall. “You only received yourschoolbooks a few days ago. Have you started reading your Transfiguration textbook?”“No, sorry professor,” Harry said.“You needn’t apologise, Mr. Potter, if you were required to read aheadyou would have been told to do so.” McGonagall’s fingers rapped the deskin front of her. “Mr. Potter, would you care to guess whether this is adesk which I Transfigured into a pig, or if it began as a pig and I brieflyremoved the Transfiguration? If you had read the first chapter of yourtextbook, you would know.”Harry’s eyebrows furrowed slightly. “I’d guess it’d be easier to startwith a pig, since if it started as a desk, it might not know how to standup.”Professor McGonagall shook her head. “No fault to you, Mr. Potter,but the correct answer is that in Transfiguration you do not care to guess.Wrong answers will be marked with extreme severity, questions leftblank will be marked with great leniency. You must learn to know whatyou do not know. If I ask you any question, no matter how obvious orelementary, and you answer ‘I’m not sure’, I will not hold it against youand anyone who laughs will lose House points. Can you tell me why thisrule exists, Mr. Potter?”Because a single error in Transfiguration can be incredibly dangerous. “No.”“Correct. Transfiguration is more dangerous than Apparition, whichis not taught until your sixth year. Unfortunately, Transfiguration mustbe learned and practised at a young age to maximise your adult ability.So this is a dangerous subject, and you should be quite scared of makingany mistakes, because none of my students have ever been permanentlyinjured and I will be extremely put out if you are the first class to spoil myrecord.”Several students gulped.Professor McGonagall stood up and moved over to the wall behind herdesk, which held a polished wooden board. “There are many reasons whyTransfiguration is dangerous, but one reason stands above all the rest.”She produced a short quill with a thick end, and used it to sketch lettersin red; which she then underlined, using the same marker, in blue:“Transfiguration is not permanent!” said Professor McGonagall.“Transfiguration is not permanent! Transfiguration is not permanent!Mr. Potter, suppose a student Transfigured a block of wood into a cup ofwater, and you drank it. What do you imagine might happen to you whenthe Transfiguration wore off?” There was a pause. “Excuse me, I shouldnot have asked that of you, Mr. Potter, I forgot that you are blessed withan unusually pessimistic imagination—”“I’m fine,” Harry said, swallowing hard. “So the first answer is that Idon’t know,” the Professor nodded approvingly, “but I imagine there mightbe… wood in my stomach, and in my bloodstream, and if any of that water had gotten absorbed into my body’s tissues—would it be wood pulpor solid wood or…” Harry’s grasp of magic failed him. He couldn’t understand how wood mapped into water in the first place, so he couldn’t understand what would happen after the water molecules were scrambledby ordinary thermal motions and the magic wore off and the mappingreversed.McGonagall’s face was stiff. “As Mr. Potter has correctly reasoned,he would become extremely sick and require immediate Flooing to St.Mungo’s Hospital if he was to have any chance of survival. Please turnyour textbooks to page 5.”Even without any sound in the moving picture, you could tell that thewoman with horribly discolored skin was screaming.“The criminal who originally Transfigured gold into wine and gave itto this woman to drink, ‘in payment of the debt’ as he put it, received asentence of ten years in Azkaban. Please turn to page 6. That is a Dementor. They are the guardians of Azkaban. They suck away at your magic,your life, and any happy thoughts you try to have. The picture on page 7is of the criminal ten years later, on his release. You will note that he isdead—yes, Mr. Potter?”“Professor,” Harry said, “if the worst happens in a case like that, isthere any way of maintaining the Transfiguration?”“No,” Professor McGonagall said flatly. “Sustaining a Transfigurationis a constant drain on your magic which scales with the size of the targetform. And you would need to recontact the target every few hours, whichis, in a case like this, impossible. Disasters like this are unrecoverable!”Professor McGonagall leaned forwards, her face very hard. “You willabsolutely never under any circumstances Transfigure anything into aliquid or a gas. No water, no air. Nothing like water, nothing like air.Even if it is not meant to drink. Liquid evaporates, little bits and pieces of itget into the air. You will not Transfigure anything that is to be burned. Itwill make smoke and someone could breathe that smoke! You will neverTransfigure anything that could conceivably go inside anyone’s body byany means. No food. Nothing that looks like food. Not even as a funnylittle prank where you mean to tell them about your mud pie before theyactually eat it. You will never do it. Period. Inside this classroom or outof it or anywhere. Is that well understood by every single student?”“Yes,” said Harry, Hermione, and a few others. The rest seemed to bespeechless.“Is that well understood by every single student?”“Yes,” they said or muttered or whispered.“If you break any of these rules you will not further study Transfiguration during your stay at Hogwarts. Repeat along with me. I will neverTransfigure anything into a liquid or gas.”“I will never Transfigure anything into a liquid or gas,” said the students in ragged chorus.“Again! Louder! I will never Transfigure anything into a liquid orgas.”“I will never Transfigure anything into a liquid or gas.”“I will never Transfigure anything that looks like food or anything elsethat goes inside a human body.”“I will never Transfigure anything that is to be burned because it couldmake smoke.”“You will never Transfigure anything that looks like money, includingMuggle money,” said Professor McGonagall. “The goblins have ways offinding out who did it. As a matter of recognised law, the goblin nationis in a permanent state of war with all magical counterfeiters. They willnot send Aurors. They will send an army.”“I will never Transfigure anything that looks like money,” repeatedthe students.“And above all,” said Professor McGonagall, “you will not Transfigureany living subject, especially yourselves. It will make you very sick andpossibly dead, depending on how you Transfigure yourself and howlong you maintain the change.” Professor McGonagall paused. “Mr. Potter is currently holding up his hand because he has seen an Animagustransformation—specifically, a human transforming into a cat and backagain. But an Animagus transformation is not free Transfiguration.”Professor McGonagall took a small chunk of wood out of her pocket.With a tap of her wand it became a glass ball. Then she said “Crystferrium!”and the glass ball became a steel ball. She tapped it with her wand onelast time and the steel ball became a piece of wood once more. “Crystferrium transforms a subject of solid glass into a similarly shaped target ofsolid steel. It cannot do the reverse, nor can it transform a desk into a pig.The most general form of Transfiguration—free Transfiguration, whichyou will be learning here—is capable of transforming any subject into anytarget, at least so far as physical form is concerned. For this reason, freeTransfiguration must be done wordlessly. Using Charms would requiredifferent words for every different transformation between subject andtarget.”Professor McGonagall gave her students a sharp look. “Some teachersbegin with Transfiguration Charms and move on to free Transfigurationafterwards. Yes, that would be much easier in the beginning. But it canset you in a poor mold which impairs your abilities later. Here you willlearn free Transfiguration from the very start, which requires that you cast188 *the spell wordlessly, by holding the subject form, the target form, and thetransformation within your own mind.”“And to answer Mr. Potter’s question,” Professor McGonagall went on,“it is free Transfiguration which you must never do to any living subject.There are Charms and potions which can safely, reversibly transform living subjects in limited ways. An Animagus with a missing limb will still bemissing that limb after transforming, for example. Free Transfigurationis not safe. Your body will change while it is Transfigured—breathing, forexample, results in a constant loss of the body’s stuff to the surroundingair. When the Transfiguration wears off and your body tries to revert toits original form, it will not quite be able to do so. If you press your wandto your body and imagine yourself with golden hair, afterwards your hairwill fall out. If you visualise yourself as someone with clearer skin, youwill be taking a long stay at St. Mungo’s. And if you Transfigure yourselfinto an adult bodily form, then, when the Transfiguration wears off, youwill die.”That explained why he had seen such things as fat boys, or girls lessthan perfectly pretty. Or old people, for that matter. That wouldn’t happen if you could just Transfigure yourself every morning… Harry raisedhis hand and tried to signal Professor McGonagall with his eyes.“Yes, Mr. Potter?”“Is it possible to Transfigure a living subject into a target that is static,such as a coin—no, excuse me, I’m terribly sorry, let’s just say a steel ball.”Professor McGonagall shook her head. “Mr. Potter, even inanimateobjects undergo small internal changes over time. There would be no visible changes to your body afterwards, and for the first minute, you wouldnotice nothing wrong. But in an hour you would be sick, and in a day youwould be dead.”“Erm, excuse me, so if I’d read the first chapter I could have guessedthat the desk was originally a desk and not a pig,” Harry said, “but onlyif I made the further assumption that you didn’t want to kill the pig, thatmight seem highly probable but—”“I can foresee that marking your tests will be an endless source of delight to me, Mr. Potter. But if you have other questions can I please askyou to wait until after class?”189 *“No further questions, professor.”“Now repeat after me,” said Professor McGonagall. “I will never tryto Transfigure any living subject, especially myself, unless specifically instructed to do so using a specialised Charm or potion.”“If I am not sure whether a Transfiguration is safe, I will not try ituntil I have asked Professor McGonagall or Professor Flitwick or Professor Snape or the Headmaster, who are the only recognised authorities onTransfiguration at Hogwarts. Asking another student is not acceptable,even if they say that they remember asking the same question.”“Even if the current Defence Professor at Hogwarts tells me that aTransfiguration is safe, and even if I see the Defence Professor do it andnothing bad seems to happen, I will not try it myself.”“I have the absolute right to refuse to perform any Transfigurationabout which I feel the slightest bit nervous. Since not even the Headmaster of Hogwarts can order me to do otherwise, I certainly will not acceptany such order from the Defence Professor, even if the Defence Professorthreatens to deduct one hundred House points and have me expelled.”“If I break any of these rules I will not further study Transfigurationduring my time at Hogwarts.”“We will repeat these rules at the start of every class for the firstmonth,” said Professor McGonagall. “And now, we will begin withmatches as subjects and needles as targets… put away your wands, thankyou, by ‘begin’ I meant that you will begin taking notes.”Half an hour before the end of class, Professor McGonagall handedout the matches.At the end of the class Hermione had a silvery-looking match and theentire rest of the class, Muggleborn or otherwise, had exactly what they’dstarted with.Professor McGonagall awarded her another point for Ravenclaw.After the Transfiguration class was dismissed, Hermione came over toHarry’s desk as Harry was putting away his books into his pouch.190 *“You know,” Hermione said with an innocent expression on her face,“I earned two points for Ravenclaw today.”“So you did,” Harry said shortly.“But that wasn’t as good as your seven points,” she said. “I guess I’mjust not as intelligent as you.”Harry finished feeding his homework into the pouch and turned toHermione with his eyes narrowed. He’d actually forgotten about that.She batted her eyelashes at him. “We have lessons every day, though. Iwonder how long it will take you to find some more Hufflepuffs to rescue?Today is Monday. So that gives you until Thursday.”The two of them stared into each other’s eyes, unblinking.Harry spoke first. “Of course you realise this means war.”“I didn’t know we’d been at peace.”All of the other students were now watching with fascinated eyes. Allof the other students, plus, unfortunately, Professor McGonagall.“Oh, Mr. Potter,” sang Professor McGonagall from the other side ofthe room, “I have some good news for you. Madam Pomfrey has approvedyour suggestion for preventing breakage in her Spimster wickets, and theplan is to finish the job by the end of next week. I’d say that deserves… let’scall it ten points for Ravenclaw.”Hermione’s face was gaping in betrayal and shock. Harry imaginedhis own face didn’t look much different.“Professor…” Harry hissed.“Those ten points are unquestionably deserved, Mr. Potter. I would nothand out House points on a whim. To you it might have been a simplematter of seeing something fragile and suggesting a way to protect it, butSpimster wickets are expensive, and the Headmaster was not pleased thelast time one broke.” Professor McGonagall looked thoughtful. “My, Iwonder if any other student has ever earned seventeen House points onhis first day of lessons. I’ll have to look it up, but I suspect that’s a newrecord. Perhaps we should have an announcement at dinnertime?”“PROFESSOR!” Harry shrieked. “This is our war! Stop meddling!”“Now you have until Thursday of next week, Mr. Potter. Unless, ofcourse, you engage in some sort of mischief and lose House points before then. Addressing a professor disrespectfully, for example.” Profes*sor McGonagall put a finger on her cheek and looked reflective. “I expectyou’ll hit negative numbers before the end of Friday.”Harry’s mouth snapped shut. He sent his best Death Glare at McGonagall but she only seemed to find it amusing.“Yes, definitely an announcement at dinner,” Professor McGonagallmused. “But it wouldn’t do to offend the Slytherins, so the announcement should be brief. Just the number of points and the fact of therecord… and if anyone comes to you for help with their schoolwork and isdisappointed that you haven’t even started reading your textbooks, youcan always refer them to Miss Granger.”“Professor!” said Hermione in a rather high-pitched voice.Professor McGonagall ignored her. “My, I wonder how long it willtake before Miss Granger does something deserving of a dinnertime announcement? I look forward to seeing it, whatever it may be.”Harry and Hermione, by unspoken mutual consent, turned andstormed out of the classroom. They were followed by a trail of hypnotised Ravenclaws.“Um,” Harry said. “Are we still on for after dinner?”“Of course,” said Hermione. “I wouldn’t want you to fall further behind on your studying.”“Why, thank you. And let me say that as brilliant as you are already, Ican’t help but wonder what you’ll be like once you have some elementarytraining in rationality.”“Is it really that useful? It didn’t seem to help you with Charms orTransfiguration.”There was a slight pause.“Well, I only got my schoolbooks four days ago. That’s why I had toearn those seventeen House points without using my wand.”“Four days ago? Maybe you can’t read eight books in four days butyou might have at least read one. How many days will it take to finish atthat rate? You know all that mathematics, so can you tell me what’s eight,times four, divided by zero?”“I’ve got classes now, which you didn’t, but weekends are free, so…limit of eight times four divided by epsilon as epsilon approaches zeroplus… 10:47am on Sunday.”“I did it in three days actually.”“2:47pm on Saturday it is, then. I’m sure I’ll find the time somewhere.”And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.s soon as he walked into the Defence classroom on Wednesday, Harryknew that this subject was going to be different.It was, for a start, the largest classroom he had yet seen at Hogwarts,akin to a major university classroom, with layered tiers of desks facinga gigantic flat stage of white marble. The classroom was high up in thecastle—on the fifth floor—and Harry knew that was as much explanationas he’d get for where a room like this was supposed to fit. It was becomingclear that Hogwarts simply did not have a geometry, Euclidean or otherwise; it had connections, not directions.Unlike a university hall, there weren’t rows of folding seats; insteadthere were quite ordinary Hogwarts wooden desks and wooden chairs,lined up in a curve across each level of the classroom. Except that eachdesk had a flat, white, rectangular, mysterious object propped up on it.In the center of the gigantic platform, on a small raised dais of darkermarble, was a lone teacher’s desk. At which Quirrell sat slumped over inhis chair, head lolled back, drooling slightly over his robes.Now what does that remind me of…?Harry had arrived at the lesson so early that no other students werethere yet. (The English language was defective when it came to describing time travel; in particular, English lacked any words capable of expressing how convenient it was.) Quirrell didn’t seem to be… functional…at the moment, and Harry didn’t particularly feel like approaching Quirrell anyway.Harry selected a desk, climbed up to it, sat down, and retrieved theDefence textbook. He was around seven-eighths of the way through—he’d planned on finishing the book before this lesson, actually, but he wasrunning behind schedule and had already used the Time-Turner twicetoday.Soon there were sounds as the classroom began to fill up. Harry ignored them.“Potter? What are you doing here?”That voice didn’t belong here. Harry looked up. “Draco? What are youdoing in oh my god you have minions.”One of the lads standing behind Draco seemed to have rather a lot ofmuscle for an eleven-year-old, and the other was poised in a suspiciouslybalanced-looking stance.The white-blonde-haired boy smiled rather smugly and gestured behind him. “Potter, I introduce to you Mr. Crabbe,” his hand moved fromMuscles to Balance, “Mr. Goyle. Vincent, Gregory, this is Harry Potter.”Mr. Goyle tilted his head and gave Harry a look that was probably supposed to mean something but ended up just looking squinty. Mr. Crabbesaid “Please to meetcha” in a tone that sounded like he was trying to lowerhis voice as far as it could go.A fleeting expression of consternation crossed Draco’s face, but wasquickly replaced by his superior grin.“You have minions!” Harry repeated. “Where do I get minions?”Draco’s smirk grew wider. “I’m afraid, Potter, that the first step is tobe Sorted into Slytherin—”“What? That’s not fair!”“—and then for your families to have an arrangement from before youwere born.”Harry looked at Mr. Crabbe and Mr. Goyle. They both seemed to betrying very hard to loom. That is, they were leaning forwards, hunchingover their shoulders, sticking their necks out and staring at him.“Um… hold on,” said Harry. “This was arranged years ago?”“Exactly, Potter. I’m afraid you’re out of luck.”Mr. Goyle produced a toothpick and began cleaning his teeth, stilllooming.“And,” said Harry, “Lucius insisted that you were not to grow up knowing your bodyguards, and that you were only to meet them on your firstday of school.”That wiped the grin from Draco’s face. “Yes, Potter, we all know you’rebrilliant, the whole school knows by now, you can stop showing off—”“So they’ve been told their whole lives that they’re going to be your minions and they’ve spent years imagining what minions are supposed to belike—”Draco winced.“—and what’s worse, they do know each other and they’ve been practising—”“The boss told ya to shut it,” rumbled Mr. Crabbe. Mr. Goyle bit downon his toothpick, holding it between his teeth, and used one hand to crackthe knuckles on the other.“I told you not to do this in front of Harry Potter!”The two looked a bit sheepish and Mr. Goyle quickly put the toothpickback in a pocket of his robes.But the moment Draco turned away from them to face Harry again,they went back to looming.“I apologise,” Draco said stiffly, “for the insult which these imbecileshave offered you.”Harry gave a meaningful look to Mr. Crabbe and Mr. Goyle. “I’d sayyou’re being a little harsh on them, Draco. I think they’re acting exactlythe way I’d want my minions to act. I mean, if I had any minions.”Draco’s jaw dropped.“Hey, Gregory, you don’ think he’s tryna lure us away from the boss,do ya?”“I’m sure Mr. Potter wouldn’t be that foolish.”“Oh, I wouldn’t dream of it,” Harry said smoothly. “It’s just somethingto keep in mind if your current employer seems unappreciative. Besides,it never hurts to have other offers while you’re negotiating your workingconditions, right?”“What’s he doin’ in Ravenclaw?”“I can’t imagine, Mr. Crabbe.”“Both of you shut up,” Draco said through gritted teeth. “That’s an order.” With a visible effort, he transferred his attention to Harry again.“Anyway, what’re you doing in the Slytherin Defence class?”Harry frowned. “Hold on.” His hand went into his pouch. “Timetable.”He looked over the parchment. “Defence, 2:30pm, and right now it’s…”Harry looked at his mechanical watch, which read 11:23. “2:23, unlessI’ve lost track of time. Did I?” If he had, well, Harry knew how to get towhatever lesson he was supposed to be at. God he loved his Time-Turnerand someday, when he was old enough, they would get married.“No, that sounds right,” Draco said, looking puzzled. His gaze turnedto look over the rest of the auditorium, which was filling with greentrimmed robes and…“Gryffindorks!” spat Draco. “What’re they doing here?”“Hm,” Harry said. “Professor Quirrell did say… I forget his exactwords… that he would be ignoring some of the Hogwarts teaching conventions. Maybe he just combined all his classes.”“Huh,” said Draco. “You’re the first Ravenclaw in here.”“Yup. Got here early.”“What’re you doing all the way in the back row, then?”Harry blinked. “I dunno, seemed like a good place to sit?”Draco made a scoffing sound. “You couldn’t get any further awayfrom the teacher if you tried.” The blonde-haired boy leaned slightlycloser. “Anyway, is it true about what you said to Derrick and his crew?”“Who’s Derrick?”“You hit him with a pie?”“Two pies, actually. What am I supposed to have said to him?”“That he wasn’t doing anything cunning or ambitious and he was adisgrace to Salazar Slytherin.” Draco was staring intently at Harry.“That… sounds about right,” Harry said. “I think it was more like, ‘isthis some kind of incredibly clever plot that will gain you a future advantage or is it really as much of a disgrace to the memory of Salazar Slytherinas it looks like’ or something like that. I don’t remember the exact words.”“You’re confusing everyone, you know,” said the blonde-haired boy.“Huh?” Harry said in honest confusion.“Warrington said that spending a long time under the Sorting Hatis one of the warning signs of a major Dark Wizard. Everyone was talking about it, wondering if they should start sucking up to you just incase. Then you went and protected a bunch of Hufflepuffs, for Merlin’s198 *sake. Then you told Derrick he’s a disgrace to Salazar Slytherin’s memory! What’s anyone supposed to think?”“That the Sorting Hat decided to put me in the House of ‘Slytherin!Just kidding! Ravenclaw!’ and I’ve been acting accordingly.”Mr. Crabbe and Mr. Goyle both giggled, causing Mr. Goyle to quicklyclap a hand to his mouth.“We’d better go get our seats,” Draco said. He hesitated, straighteneda bit, spoke a bit more fomally. “But I do want to continue our last conversation and I accept your conditions.”Harry nodded. “Would you mind terribly if I waited until Saturdayafternoon? I’m in a bit of a contest right now.”“A contest?”“See if I can read all my textbooks as fast as Hermione Granger did.”“Granger,” Draco echoed. His eyes narrowed. “The mudblood whothinks she’s Merlin? If you’re trying to show her up then all Slytherinwishes you the very best luck, Potter, and I won’t bother you ‘til Saturday.” Draco inclined his head respectfully, and wandered off, tailed byhis minions.Oh, this is going to be so much fun to juggle, I can already tell.The classroom was filling up rapidly now with all four colors of trim:green, red, yellow, and blue. Draco and his two friends seemed to be inthe midst of trying to acquire three contiguous front-row seats—alreadyoccupied, of course. Mr. Crabbe and Mr. Goyle were looming vigorously,but it didn’t seem to be having much effect.Harry bent over his Defence textbook and continued reading.At 2:35pm, when most of the seats were taken and no one else seemed tobe coming in, Professor Quirrell gave a sudden jerk in his chair and sat upstraight, and his face appeared on all the flat, white rectangular objectsthat were propped up on the students’ desks.Harry was taken by surprise, both by the sudden appearance of Professor Quirrell’s face and by the resemblance to Muggle television. There199 *was something both nostalgic and sad about that, it seemed so much likea piece of home and yet it wasn’t really…“Good afternoon, my young apprentices,” said Professor Quirrell. Hisvoice seemed to come from the desk screen and to be speaking directlyto Harry. “Welcome to your first lesson in Battle Magic, as the foundersof Hogwarts would have put it; or, as it happens to be called in the latetwentieth century, Defence Against the Dark Arts.”There was a certain amount of frantic scrabbling as students, takenby surprise, reached for their parchment or notebooks.“No,” Professor Quirrell said. “Don’t bother writing down what thissubject was once called. No such pointless question will count towardyour marks in any of my lessons. That is a promise.”Many students sat straight up at that, looking rather shocked.Professor Quirrell was smiling thinly. “Those of you who have wastedtime by reading your useless first-year Defence textbooks—”Someone made a choking sound. Harry wondered if it was Hermione.“—may have gotten the impression that although this subject is calledDefence Against the Dark Arts, it is actually about how to defend againstNightmare Butterflies, which cause mildly bad dreams, or Acid Slugs,which can dissolve all the way through a two-inch wooden beam givenmost of a day.”Professor Quirrell stood up, shoving his chair back from the desk. Thescreen on Harry’s desk followed his every move. Professor Quirrell strodetowards the front of the classroom, and bellowed:“The Hungarian Horntail is taller than a dozen men! It breathes fireso quickly and so accurately that it can melt a Snitch in midflight! OneKilling Curse will bring it down!”There were gasps from the students.“The Mountain Troll is more dangerous than the Hungarian Horntail!It is strong enough to bite through steel! Its hide is resistant enough towithstand Stunning Hexes and Cutting Charms! Its sense of smell is soacute that it can tell from afar whether its prey is part of a pack, or aloneand vulnerable! Most fearsome of all, the troll is unique among magical creatures in continuously maintaining a form of Transfiguration onitself—it is always transforming into its own body. If you somehow succeed in ripping off its arm it will grow another within seconds! Fire andacid will produce scar tissue which can temporarily confuse a troll’s regenerative powers—for an hour or two! They are smart enough to use clubsas tools! The mountain troll is the third most perfect killing machine inall Nature! One Killing Curse will bring it down.”The students were looking rather shocked.Professor Quirrell was smiling rather grimly. “Your sad excuse for athird-year Defence textbook will suggest to you that you expose the mountain troll to sunlight, which will freeze it in place. This, my young apprentices, is the sort of useless knowledge you will never find in my lessons.You do not encounter mountain trolls in open daylight! The idea that youshould use sunlight to stop them is the result of foolish textbook authorstrying to show off their mastery of minutia at the expense of practicality.Just because there is a ridiculously obscure way of dealing with mountaintrolls does not mean you should actually try to use it! The Killing Curse isunblockable, unstoppable, and works every single time on anything witha brain. If, as an adult wizard, you find yourself incapable of using theKilling Curse, then you can simply Apparate away! Likewise if you arefacing the second most perfect killing machine, a Dementor. You justApparate away!”“Unless, of course,” Professor Quirrell said, his voice now lower andharder, “you are under the influence of an anti-Apparition jinx. No, thereis exactly one monster which can threaten you once you are fully grown.The single most dangerous monster in all the world, so dangerous thatnothing else comes close. The Dark Wizard. That is the only thing thatwill still be able to threaten you.”Professor Quirrell’s lips were set in a thin line. “I will reluctantly teachyou enough trivia for a passing mark on the Ministry-mandated portionsof your first-year finals. Since your exact mark on these sections willmake no difference to your future life, anyone who wants more than apassing mark is welcome to waste their own time studying our patheticexcuse for a textbook. The title of this subject is not Defence Against Minor Pests. You are here to learn how to defend yourselves against theDark Arts. Which means, let us be very clear on this, defending yourselvesagainst Dark Wizards. People with wands who want to hurt you and whowill likely succeed in doing so unless you hurt them first! There is no defence without offence! There is no defence without fighting! This reality is deemed too harsh for eleven-year-olds by the fat, overpaid, Aurorguarded politicians who mandated your curriculum. To the abyss withthose fools! You are here for the subject that has been taught at Hogwartsfor eight hundred years! Welcome to your first year of Battle Magic!”Harry started applauding. He couldn’t help himself, it was too inspiring.Once Harry started clapping there was some scattered response fromGryffindor, and more from Slytherin, but most students simply seemedtoo stunned to react.Professor Quirrell made a cutting gesture, and the applause diedinstantly. “Thank you very much,” said Professor Quirrell. “Now topracticalities. I have combined all my first-year Battle classes into one,which allows me to offer you twice as much classroom time as Doublessessions—”There were gasps of horror.“—an increased load which I will make up to you by not assigning anyhomework.”The gasps of horror cut off abruptly.“Yes, you heard me correctly. I will teach you to fight, not to writetwelve inches on fighting due Monday.”Harry desperately wished he’d sat next to Hermione so he could seethe look on her face now, but on the other hand he was pretty sure he wasimagining it accurately.Also Harry was in love. It would be a three-way wedding: him, theTime-Turner, and Professor Quirrell.“For those of you who so choose, I have arranged some after-schoolactivities that I think you will find quite interesting as well as educational.Do you want to show the world your own abilities instead of watchingfourteen other people play Quidditch? More than seven people can fightin an army.”Hot damn.202 *“These and other after-school activities will also earn you Quirrellpoints. What are Quirrell points, you ask? The House point system doesnot suit my needs, because it makes House points too rare. I prefer to letmy students know how they are doing more frequently than that. Andon the rare occasions I offer you a written test, it will mark itself as yougo along, and if you get too many related questions wrong, your test willshow the names of students who got those questions right, and thosestudents will be able to earn Quirrell points by helping you.”…wow. Why didn’t the other professors use a system like that?“What good are Quirrell points, you wonder? For a start, ten Quirrellpoints will be worth one House point. But they will earn you other favorsas well. Would you like to take your exam at an unusual time? Is there aparticular session you would very much prefer to skip? You will find thatI can be very flexible on behalf of students who have accumulated enoughQuirrell points. Quirrell points will control the generalship of the armies.And for Christmas—just before the Christmas break—I will grant someone a wish. Any school-related feat that lies within my power, my influence, or above all, my ingenuity. Yes, I was in Slytherin and I am offeringto formulate a cunning plot on your behalf, if that is what it takes to accomplish your desire. This wish will go to whoever has earned the mostQuirrell points within all seven years.”That would be Harry.“Now leave your books and loose items at your desks—they will besafe, the screens will watch over them for you—and come down onto thisplatform. It’s time to play a game called Who’s the Most Dangerous Student in the Classroom.”Harry twisted his wand in his right hand and said “Ma-ha-su!”There was another high-pitched “bing” from the floating blue spherethat Professor Quirrell had assigned to Harry as his target. That particular sound meant a perfect strike, which Harry had been gotten on nineout of his last ten attempts.203 *Somewhere Professor Quirrell had dug up a spell that was incrediblyeasy to pronounce, and had a ridiculously simple wand motion, and hada tendency to hit wherever you were currently looking at. Professor Quirrell had disdainfully proclaimed that real battle magic was far more difficult than this. That the hex was entirely useless in actual combat. Thatit was a barely ordered burst of magic whose only real content was theaiming, and that it would produce, when it hit, a pain briefly equivalentto being punched hard in the nose. That the sole purpose of this test wasto see who was a fast learner, since Professor Quirrell was certain no onewould have previously encountered this hex or anything like it.Harry didn’t care about any of that.“Ma-ha-su!”A red bolt of energy shot out of his wand and struck the target and theblue sphere once again made the bing which meant the spell had actuallyworked for him.Harry was feeling like a real wizard for the first time since he’d cometo Hogwarts. He wished the target would dodge like the little spheres thatBen Kenobi had used for training Luke, but for some reason ProfessorQuirrell had instead lined up all the students and targets in neat orderswhich made sure they wouldn’t fire on each other.So Harry lowered his wand, skipped to the right, snapped up his wandand twisted and shouted “Ma-ha-su!”There was a lower-pitched “dong” which meant he’d gotten it almostright.Harry put his wand into his pocket, skipped back to the left and drewand fired another red bolt of energy.The high-pitched bing which resulted was easily one of the most satisfying sounds he’d heard in his life. Harry wanted to scream in triumphat the top of his lungs. I CAN DO MAGIC! FEAR ME, LAWS OF PHYSICS,“Ma-ha-su!” Harry’s voice was loud, but hardly noticeable over thesteady chant of similar cries from around the classroom platform.“Enough,” said Professor Quirrell’s amplified voice. (It didn’t soundloud. It sounded like normal volume, coming from just behind your leftshoulder, no matter where you were standing relative to Professor Quir*204 *rell.) “I see that all of you have succeeded at least once now.” The targetspheres turned red and began to drift up towards the ceiling.Professor Quirrell was standing on the raised dais in the center of theplatform, leaning slightly on his teacher’s desk with one hand.“I told you,” Professor Quirrell said, “that we would play a game calledWho’s the Most Dangerous Student in the Classroom. There is one student in this classroom who mastered the Sumerian Simple Strike Hexfaster than anyone else—”Oh blah blah blah.“—and went on to help seven other students. For which she hasearned the first seven Quirrell points awarded to your year. Come forth,Hermione Granger. It is time for the next stage of the game.”Hermione Granger began striding forwards, a mixed look of triumphand apprehension on her face. The Ravenclaws looked on proudly, theSlytherins with glares, and Harry with frank annoyance. Harry had donefine this time. He was probably even in the upper half of the class, nowthat everyone had been faced with an equally unfamiliar spell and Harryhad read all the way through Adalbert Waffling’s Magical Theory. And yetHermione was still doing better.Somewhere in the back of his mind was the fear that Hermione wassimply smarter than him.But for now Harry was going to pin his hopes on the known facts that(a) Hermione had read a lot more than the standard textbooks and (b)Adalbert Waffling was an uninspired sod who’d written Magical Theory topander to a school board that didn’t think much of eleven-year-olds.Hermione reached the central dais and stepped up.“Hermione Granger mastered a completely unfamiliar spell in twominutes, almost a full minute faster than the next runner-up.” ProfessorQuirrell turned slowly in place to look at all the students watching them.“Could Miss Granger’s intelligence make her the most dangerous studentin the classroom? Well? What do you think?”No one seemed to be thinking anything at the moment. Even Harrywasn’t sure what to say.“Let’s find out, shall we?” said Professor Quirrell. He turned back toHermione, and gestured toward the wider class. “Select any student you205 *like and cast the Simple Strike Hex on them.”Hermione froze where she stood.“Come now,” Professor Quirrell said smoothly. “You have cast thisspell perfectly over fifty times. It is not permanently harmful or even allthat painful. It hurts as much as a hard punch and lasts only a few seconds.” Professor Quirrell’s voice grew harder. “This is a direct order fromyour professor, Miss Granger. Choose a target and fire a Simple StrikeHex.”Hermione’s face was screwed up in horror and her wand was trembling in her hand. Harry’s own fingers were clenching his own wand hardin sympathy. Even though he could see what Professor Quirrell was trying to do. Even though he could see the point Professor Quirrell was trying to make.“If you do not raise your wand and fire, Miss Granger, you will lose aQuirrell point.”Harry stared at Hermione, willing her to look in his direction. Hisright hand was softly tapping his own chest. Pick me, I’m not afraid…Hermione’s wand twitched in her hand; then her face relaxed, andshe lowered her wand to her side.“No,” said Hermione Granger.Her voice was calm, and even though it wasn’t loud, everyone heardit in the silence.“Then I must deduct one point from you,” said Professor Quirrell.“This is a test, and you have failed it.”That reached her. Harry could see it. But she kept her shouldersstraight.Professor Quirrell’s voice was sympathetic and seemed to fill thewhole room. “Knowing things isn’t always enough, Miss Granger. If youcannot give and receive violence on the order of stubbing your toe, thenyou cannot defend yourself and you will not pass Defence. Please rejoinyour classmates.”Hermione walked back towards the Ravenclaw cluster. Her facelooked peaceful and Harry, for some odd reason, wanted to start clapping. Even though Professor Quirrell had been right.206 *“So,” Professor Quirrell said. “It becomes clear that Hermione Granger is not the most dangerous student in the classroom. Who do youthink might actually be the most dangerous person here?—besides me,of course.”Without even thinking, Harry turned to look at the Slytherin contingent.“Draco, of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy,” said Professor Quirrell. “It seems that many of your fellow pupils are looking in yourdirection. Come forth, if you would.”Draco did so, walking with a certain pride in his bearing. He steppedonto the dais and looked up at Professor Quirrell with a smile.“Mr. Malfoy,” Professor Quirrell said. “Fire.”Harry would have tried to stop it if there’d been time but in onesmooth motion Draco spun on the Ravenclaw contingent and raised hiswand and said “Mahasu!” like it was all one syllable and Hermione wassaying “Ow!” and that was that.“Well struck,” said Professor Quirrell. “Two Quirrell points to you.But tell me, why did you target Miss Granger?”There was a pause.Finally Draco said, “Because she stood out the most.”Professor Quirrell’s lips turned up in a thin smile. “And that is the truereason why Draco Malfoy is dangerous. Had he selected any other, thatchild would more likely resent being singled out, and Mr. Malfoy wouldmore probably make an enemy. And while Mr. Malfoy might have givensome other justification for selecting her, that would have served him nopurpose save to alienate some of you, while others are already cheeringhim whether he says anything or not. Which is to say that Mr. Malfoy isdangerous because he knows who to strike and who not to strike, howto make allies and avoid making enemies. Two more Quirrell points toyou, Mr. Malfoy. And as you have demonstrated an exemplary virtue ofSlytherin, I think that Salazar’s House has earned a point as well. Youmay rejoin your friends.”Draco bowed slightly and walked back to the Slytherin contingent.Some clapping started from the green-trimmed robes, but ProfessorQuirrell made a cutting gesture and silence fell again.207 *“It might seem that our game is done,” said Professor Quirrell. “Andyet there is a single student in this classroom who is more dangerous thanthe scion of Malfoy.”And now for some reason there seemed to be an awful lot of peoplelooking at…“Harry Potter. Come forth.”This did not bode well.Harry reluctantly walked towards where Professor Quirrell stood onhis raised dais, still leaning slightly against his teacher’s desk.The nervousness of being put into the spotlight seemed to be sharpening Harry’s wits as he approached the dais, and his mind was rufflingthrough possibilities for what Professor Quirrell might think coulddemonstrate Harry’s dangerousness. Would he be asked to cast a spell?To defeat a Dark Lord?Demonstrate his supposed immunity to the Killing Curse? Surely Professor Quirrell was too smart for that…Harry stopped well short of the dais, and Professor Quirrell didn’t askhim to come any closer.“The irony is,” said Professor Quirrell, “you all looked at the right person for entirely the wrong reasons. You are thinking,” Professor Quirrell’s lips twisted, “that Harry Potter has defeated the Dark Lord, and somust be very dangerous. Bah. He was one year old. Whatever quirk offate killed the Dark Lord likely had little to do with Mr. Potter’s abilitiesas a fighter. But after I heard rumors of one Ravenclaw facing down fiveolder Slytherins, I interviewed several eyewitnesses and came to the conclusion that Harry Potter would be my most dangerous student.”A jolt of adrenaline poured into Harry’s system, making him stand upstraighter. He didn’t know what conclusion Professor Quirrell had cometo, but that couldn’t be good.“Ah, Professor Quirrell—” Harry started to say.Professor Quirrell looked amused. “You’re thinking that I’ve come upwith a wrong answer, aren’t you, Mr. Potter? You will learn to expect better of me.” Professor Quirrell straightened from where he had leaned onthe desk. “Mr. Potter, all things have their accustomed uses. Give me tenunaccustomed uses of objects in this room for combat!”208 *For a moment Harry was rendered speechless by the sheer, raw shockof having been understood.And then the ideas started to pour out.“There are desks which are heavy enough to be fatal if dropped froma great height. There are chairs with metal legs that could impale someone if driven hard enough. The air in this classroom would be deadly byits absence, since people die in vacuum, and it can serve as a carrier forpoison gases.”Harry had to stop briefly for breath, and into that pause ProfessorQuirrell said:“That’s three. You need ten. The rest of the class thinks that you’vealready used up the whole contents of the classroom.”“Ha! The floor can be removed to create a spike pit to fall into, theceiling can be collapsed on someone, the walls can serve as raw materialfor Transfiguration into any number of deadly things—knives, say.”“That’s six. But surely you’re scraping the bottom of the barrel now?”“I haven’t even started! Just look at all the people! Having a Gryffindorattack the enemy is an ordinary use, of course—”“I will not count that one.”“—but their blood can also be used to drown someone. Ravenclawsare known for their brains, but their internal organs could be sold on theblack market for enough money to hire an assassin. Slytherins aren’t justuseful as assassins, they can also be thrown at sufficient velocity to crushan enemy. And Hufflepuffs, in addition to being hard workers, also contain bones that can be removed, sharpened, and used to stab someone.”By now the rest of the class was staring at Harry in some horror. Eventhe Slytherins looked shocked.“That’s ten, though I’m being generous in counting the Ravenclawone. Now, for extra credit, one Quirrell point for each use of objects inthis room which you have not yet named.” Professor Quirrell favoredHarry with a companionable smile. “The rest of your class thinks you arein trouble now, since you’ve named everything except the targets and youhave no idea what may be done with those.”“Bah! I’ve named all the people, but not my robes, which can be usedto suffocate an enemy if wrapped around their head enough times, or209 *Hermione Granger’s robes, which can be torn into strips and tied into arope and used to hang someone, or Draco Malfoy’s robes, which can beused to start a fire—”“Three points,” said Professor Quirrell, “no more clothing now.”“My wand can be pushed into an enemy’s brain through their eyesocket” and someone made a horrified, strangling sound.“Four points, no more wands.”“My wristwatch could suffocate someone if jammed down theirthroat—”“Five points, and enough.”“Hmph,” Harry said. “Ten Quirrell points to one House point, right?You should have let me keep going until I’d won the House Cup, I haven’teven started yet on the unaccustomed uses of everything I’ve got in mypockets” or the mokeskin pouch itself and he couldn’t talk about the TimeTurner or the invisibility cloak but there had to be something he could sayabout those red spheres…“Enough, Mr. Potter. Well, do you all think you understand whatmakes Mr. Potter the most dangerous student in the classroom?”There was a low murmur of assent.“Say it out loud, please. Terry Boot, what makes your dorm-mate dangerous?”“Ah… um… he’s creative?”“Wrong!” bellowed Professor Quirrell, and his fist came down sharplyon his desk with an amplified sound that made everyone jump. “All ofMr. Potter’s ideas were worse than useless!”Harry started in surprise.“Remove the floor to create a spike trap? Ridiculous! In combat youdo not have that sort of preparation time and if you did there would bea hundred better uses! Transfigure material from the walls? Mr. Pottercannot perform Transfiguration! Mr. Potter had exactly one idea whichhe could use immediately, right now, without extensive preparation ora cooperative enemy or magic he does not know. That idea was to jamhis wand through his enemy’s eye socket. Which would be more likely tobreak his wand than kill his opponent! In short, Mr. Potter, I’m afraidthat your proposals were uniformly awful.”“What?” Harry said indignantly. “You asked for unusual ideas, notpractical ones! I was thinking outside the box! How would you use something in this classroom to kill someone?”Professor Quirrell’s expression was disapproving, but there weresmile crinkles around his eyes. “Mr. Potter, I never said you were to kill.There is a time and a place for taking your enemy alive, and inside aHogwarts classroom is usually one of those places. But to answer yourquestion, hit them on the neck with the edge of a chair.”There was some laughter from the Slytherins, but they were laughingwith Harry, not at him.Everyone else was looking rather horrified.“But Mr. Potter has now demonstrated why he is the most dangerousstudent in the classroom. I asked for unaccustomed uses of items in thisroom for combat. Mr. Potter could have suggested using a desk to blocka curse, or using a chair to trip an oncoming enemy, or wrapping clotharound his arm to create an improvised shield. Instead, every single usethat Mr. Potter named was offensive rather than defensive, and eitherfatal or potentially fatal.”What? Wait, that couldn’t be true… Harry had a sudden sense of vertigo as he tried to remember what exactly he’d suggested, surely there hadto be a counterexample…“And that,” Professor Quirrell said, “is why Mr. Potter’s ideas were sostrange and useless—because he had to reach far into the impractical inorder to meet his standard of killing the enemy. To him, any idea whichfell short of that was not worth considering. This reflects a quality thatwe might call intent to kill. I have it. Harry Potter has it, which is howhe could stare down five older Slytherins. Draco Malfoy does not have it,not yet. Mr. Malfoy would hardly shrink from talk of ordinary murder,but even he was shocked—yes you were Mr. Malfoy, I was watching yourface—when Mr. Potter described how to use his classmates’ bodies as rawmaterial. There are censors inside your mind which make you flinch awayfrom thoughts like that. Mr. Potter thinks purely of killing the enemy, hewill grasp at any means to do so, he does not flinch, his censors are off.Even though his youthful genius is so undisciplined and impractical asto be useless, his intent to kill makes Harry Potter the Most DangerousStudent in the Classroom. One final point to him—no, let us make thata point to Ravenclaw—for this indispensable requisite of a true fightingwizard.”Harry’s mouth gaped open in speechless shock as he searched frantically for something to say to this. That is so completely not what I am about!But he could see that the other students were starting to believeit. Harry’s mind was flipping through possible denials and not findinganything that could stand up against the authoritative voice of ProfessorQuirrell. The best Harry had come up with was “I’m not a psychopath,I’m just very creative” and that sounded kind of ominous. He needed tosay something unexpected, something that would make people stop andreconsider—“And now,” Professor Quirrell said. “Mr. Potter. Fire.”Nothing happened, of course.“Ah, well,” said Professor Quirrell. He sighed. “I suppose we must allstart somewhere. Mr. Potter, select any student you please for a SimpleStrike Hex. You will do so before I dismiss your class for the day. If youdo not, I will begin deducting House points, and I will keep on deductingthem until you do.”Harry carefully raised his wand. He had to do that much, or ProfessorQuirrell might start deducting House points right away.Slowly, as though on a roasting platter, Harry turned to face theSlytherins.And Harry’s eyes met Draco’s.Draco Malfoy didn’t look the slightest bit afraid. The blonde-hairedboy wasn’t giving any visible sign of assent such as Harry had given Hermione, but then he could hardly be expected to do so. The other Slytherinswould think that rather odd.“Why the hesitation?” said Professor Quirrell. “Surely there’s only oneobvious choice.”“Yes,” Harry said. “Only one obvious choice.”Harry twisted the wand and said “Ma-ha-su!”There was complete silence in the classroom.Harry shook his left arm, trying to get rid of the lingering sting.There was more silence.Finally Professor Quirrell sighed. “Yes, quite ingenious, but there wasa lesson to be taught and you dodged it. One point from Ravenclaw forshowing off your own cleverness at the expense of the actual goal. Classdismissed.”And before anyone else could say anything, Harry sang out:“Just kidding! RAVENCLAW!”There was silence for a brief moment after that, a sound of peoplethinking, and then the murmurs started and rapidly rose to a roar of conversation.Harry turned towards Professor Quirrell, the two of them needed totalk—Quirrell had slumped over and was trudging back to his chair.No. Not acceptable. They really needed to talk. Stuff the zombie act,Professor Quirrell would probably wake up if Harry poked him a coupleof times. Harry started forward—Harry swayed and stopped in his tracks, feeling dizzy.And then a flock of Ravenclaws descended on him and the discussionsbegan.hursday.If you wanted to be specific, 7:24am on Thursday morning.Harry was sitting on his bed, a textbook lying limp in his motionlesshands.Harry had just had an idea for a truly brilliant experimental test.It would mean waiting an extra hour for breakfast, but that was whyhe had cereal bars. No, this idea absolutely positively had to be testedright away, immediately, now.Harry set the textbook aside, leapt out of bed, raced around his bed,yanked out the cavern level of his trunk, ran down the stairs, and startedmoving boxes of books around. (He really needed to unpack and get bookcases at some point but he was in the middle of his textbook reading contest with Hermione and falling behind so he hadn’t had time.)Harry found the book he wanted and raced back upstairs.The other boys were getting ready to go down to breakfast in the GreatHall and start the day.“Excuse me can you do something for me?” said Harry. He was flipping through the book’s index as he spoke, found the page with the firstten thousand primes, flipped to that page, and thrust the book at AnthonyGoldstein. “Pick two three-digit numbers from this list. Don’t tell mewhat they are. Just multiply them together and tell me the product. Oh,and can you do the calculation twice to double-check? Please make reallysure you’ve got the right answer, I’m not sure what’s going to happen tome or the universe if you make a multiplication error.”It said a lot about what life in that dorm had been like over the pastfew days that Anthony didn’t even bother saying anything like “Why’d yousuddenly flip out?” or “That seems really weird, what are your reasons forasking?” or “What do you mean, you’re not sure what’s going to happento the universe?”Anthony wordlessly accepted the book and took out a parchment andquill. Harry spun around and shut his eyes, making sure not to see anything, dancing back and forth and bouncing up and down with impatience. He got a pad of paper and a mechanical pencil and got ready towrite.“Okay,” Anthony said, “One hundred and eighty-one thousand, fourhundred and twenty-nine.”Harry wrote down 181,429. He repeated what he’d just written down,and Anthony confirmed it.Then Harry raced back down into the cavern level of his trunk,glanced at his watch (the watch said 4:28 which meant 7:28) and thenshut his eyes.Around thirty seconds later, Harry heard the sound of steps, followedby the sound of the cavern level of the trunk sliding shut. (Harry wasn’tworried about suffocating. An automatic Air-Freshening Charm was partof what you got if you were willing to buy a really good trunk. Wasn’tmagic wonderful, it didn’t have to worry about electric bills.)And when Harry opened his eyes, he saw just what he’d been hopingto see, a folded piece of paper left on the floor, the gift of his future self.Call that piece of paper “Paper-2”.Harry tore a piece of paper off his pad.Call that “Paper-1”. It was, of course, the same piece of paper. Youcould even see, if you looked closely, that the ragged edges matched.Harry reviewed in his mind the algorithm that he would follow.If Harry opened up Paper-2 and it was blank, then he would write“101 × 101” down on Paper-1, fold it up, study for an hour, go back in time,drop off Paper-1 (which would thereby become Paper-2), and head on upout of the cavern level to join his dorm mates for breakfast.If Harry opened up Paper-2 and it had two numbers written on it,Harry would multiply those numbers together.If their product equaled 181,429, Harry would write down those twonumbers on Paper-1 and send Paper-1 back in time.Otherwise Harry would add 2 to the number on the right and writedown the new pair of numbers on Paper-1. Unless that made the number on the right greater than 997, in which case Harry would add 2 to thenumber on the left and write down 101 on the right.And if Paper-2 said 997×997, Harry would leave Paper-1 blank.Which meant that the only possible stable time loop was the one inwhich Paper-2 contained the two prime factors of 181,429.If this worked, Harry could use it to recover any sort of answer thatwas easy to check but hard to find. He wouldn’t have just shown thatP =NP once you had a Time-Turner, this trick was more general than that.Harry could use it to find the combinations on combination locks, or passwords of every sort. Maybe even find the entrance to Slytherin’s Chamberof Secrets, if Harry could figure out some systematic way of describing allthe locations in Hogwarts. It would be an awesome cheat even by Harry’sstandards of cheating.Harry took Paper-2 in his trembling hand, and unfolded it.Paper-2 said in slightly shaky handwriting:Do not mess with timeHarry wrote down “Do not mess with time” on Paper-1 in slightlyshaky handwriting, folded it neatly, and resolved not to do any more trulybrilliant experiments on Time until he was at least fifteen years old.To the best of Harry’s knowledge, that had been the scariest experimental result in the entire history of science.It had been somewhat difficult for Harry to focus on reading his textbook for the next hour.That was how Harry’s Thursday started.Thursday.If you wanted to be specific, 3:32pm on Thursday afternoon.Harry and all the other boys in the first year were outside on a grassyfield with Madam Hooch, standing next to the Hogwarts supply of broomsticks. The girls would be learning to fly separately. Apparently, for somereason, girls didn’t want to learn how to fly on broomsticks in the presence of boys.Harry had been a little wobbly all day long. He just couldn’t seem tostop wondering how that particular stable time loop had been selected outof what was, in retrospect, a rather large space of possibilities.Also: seriously, broomsticks? He was going to fly on, basically, a linesegment? Wasn’t that pretty much the single most unstable shape youcould possibly find, short of attempting to hold on to a point marble?Who’d selected that design for a flying device, out of all the possibilities?Harry had been hoping that it was just a figure of speech, but no, theywere standing in front of what looked for all the world like ordinarywooden kitchen broomsticks. Had someone just gotten stuck on the ideaof broomsticks and failed to consider anything else? It had to be. Therewas no way that the optimal designs for cleaning kitchens and flyingwould happen to coincide if you worked them out from scratch.It was a clear day with a bright blue sky and a brilliant sun that wasjust begging to get in your eyes and make it impossible to see, if you weretrying to fly around the sky. The ground was nice and dry, smelling positively baked, and somehow felt very, very hard under Harry’s shoes.Harry kept reminding himself that the lowest common denominatorof eleven-year-olds was expected to learn this and it couldn’t be that hard.“Stick out your right hand over the broom, or left hand if you’re lefthanded,” called Madam Hooch. “And say, UP!”“UP!” everyone shouted.The broomstick leapt eagerly into Harry’s hand.Which put him at the head of the class, for once. Apparently saying“UP!” was a lot more difficult than it looked, and most of the broomstickswere rolling around on the ground or trying to inch away from theirwould-be riders.(Of course Harry would have bet money that Hermione had done atleast as well when it came her own turn to try, earlier in the day. Therecouldn’t possibly be anything he could master on the first try which wouldbaffle Hermione, and if there was and it turned out to be broomstick ridinginstead of anything intellectual, Harry would just die.)It took a while for everyone to get a broomstick in front of them.Madam Hooch showed them how to mount and then walked aroundthe field, correcting grips and stances. Apparently even among the fewchildren who’d been allowed to fly at home, they hadn’t been taught todo it correctly.Madam Hooch surveyed the field of boys, and nodded. “Now, when Iblow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard.”Harry swallowed hard, trying to quell the queasy feeling in his stomach.“Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straightback down by leaning forwards slightly. On my whistle—three—two—”One of the brooms shot skyward, accompanied by a young boy’sscreams—of horror, not delight. The boy was spinning at an awful rateas he ascended, they only got glimpses of his white face—As though in slow motion, Harry was leaping back off his own broomstick and scrabbling for his wand, though he didn’t really know what heplanned to do with it, he’d had exactly two sessions of Charms and the lastone had been the Hover Charm but Harry had only been able to cast thespell successfully one time out of three and he certainly couldn’t levitatewhole people—If there is any hidden power in me, let it reveal itself NOW!“Come back, boy!” shouted Madam Hooch (which had to be the mostunhelpful instruction imaginable for dealing with an out-of-controlbroomstick, from a flying instructor, and a fully automatic section ofHarry’s brain added Madam Hooch to his tally of fools).And the boy was thrown off the broomstick.He seemed to move very slowly through the air, at first.“Wingardium Leviosa!” screamed Harry.The spell failed. He could feel it fail.There was a THUD and a distant cracking sound, and the boy lay facedown on the grass in a heap.Harry sheathed his wand and raced forwards at full speed. He arrivedat the boy’s side at the same time as Madam Hooch, and Harry reachedinto his pouch and tried to recall oh god what was the name never mindhe’d just try “Healer’s Pack!” and it popped up into his hand and—“Broken wrist,” Madam Hooch said. “Calm down, boy, he just has abroken wrist!”There was a sort of mental lurch as Harry’s mind snapped out of PanicMode.The Emergency Healing Pack Plus lay open in front of him, and therewas a syringe of liquid fire in Harry’s hand, which would have kept theboy’s brain oxygenated if he’d managed to snap his neck.“Ah…” Harry said in a rather wavering sort of voice. His heart waspounding so loudly that he almost couldn’t hear himself panting forbreath. “Broken bone… right… Setting String?”“That’s for emergencies only,” snapped Madam Hooch. “Put it away,he’s fine.” She leaned over the boy, offering him a hand. “Come on, boy,it’s all right, up you get!”“You’re not seriously going to make him ride the broomstick again?”Harry said in horror.Madam Hooch sent Harry a glare. “Of course not!” She pulled theboy to his feet using his good arm—Harry saw with a shock that it wasNeville Longbottom again, what was with him?—and she turned to all thewatching children. “None of you is to move while I take this boy to thehospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you’ll be out ofHogwarts before you can say ‘Quidditch.’ Come on, dear.”And Madam Hooch walked off with Neville, who was clutching hiswrist and trying to control his sniffles.When they were out of earshot, one of the Slytherins started giggling.That set off the others.Harry turned and looked at them. It seemed like a good time to memorise some faces.And Harry saw that Draco was strolling towards him, accompanied byMr. Crabbe and Mr. Goyle. Mr. Crabbe wasn’t smiling. Mr. Goyle decidedly was. Draco himself was wearing a very controlled face that twitchedoccasionally, from which Harry inferred that Draco thought it was hilarious but saw no political advantage to be gained by laughing about it nowinstead of in the Slytherin dungeons afterwards.220 *“Well, Potter,” Draco said in a low voice that didn’t carry, still withthat very controlled face that was twitching occasionally, “Just wanted tosay, when you take advantage of emergencies to demonstrate leadership,you want to look like you’re in total control of the situation, rather than,say, going into a complete panic.” Mr. Goyle giggled, and Draco shot hima quelling look. “But you probably scored a few points anyway. You needany help stowing that healer’s kit?”Harry turned to look at the Healing Pack, which got his own faceturned away from Draco. “I think I’m fine,” Harry said. He put thesyringe back in its place, redid the latches, and stood up.Ernie Macmillan arrived just as Harry was feeding the pack back intohis mokeskin pouch.“Thank you, Harry Potter, on behalf of Hufflepuff,” Ernie Macmillansaid formally. “It was a good try and a good thought.”“A good thought indeed,” drawled Draco. “Why didn’t anyone in Hufflepuff have their wands out? Maybe if you’d all helped instead of justPotter, you could’ve caught him. I thought Hufflepuffs were supposed tostick together?”Ernie looked like he was torn between getting angry and wanting todie of shame. “We didn’t think of it in time—”“Ah,” said Draco, “didn’t think of it, I guess that’s why it’s better to haveone Ravenclaw as a friend than all of Hufflepuff.”Oh, hell, how was Harry supposed to juggle this one… “You’re not helping,” Harry said in a mild tone. Hoping Draco would interpret that asyou’re interfering with my plans, please shut up.“Hey, what’s this?” said Mr. Goyle. He stooped to the grass and pickedup something around the size of a large marble, a glass ball that seemedto be filled with a swirling white mist.Ernie blinked. “Neville’s Remembrall!”“What’s a Remembrall?” asked Harry.“It turns red if you’ve forgotten something,” Ernie said. “It doesn’t tellyou what you forgot, though. Give it here, please, and I’ll hand it back toNeville later.” Ernie held out his hand.A sudden grin flashed across Mr. Goyle’s face and he spun around andraced away.Ernie stood still for a moment in surprise, and then shouted “Hey!”and ran after Mr. Goyle.And Mr. Goyle grabbed a broomstick, hopped on with one smooth motion and took to the air.Harry’s jaw dropped. Hadn’t Madam Hooch said that would get himexpelled?“That idiot!” Draco hissed. He opened his mouth to shout—“Hey!” shouted Ernie. “That’s Neville’s! Give it back!”The Slytherins started cheering and hooting.Draco’s mouth snapped shut. Harry caught the sudden look of indecision on his face.“Draco,” Harry said in a low tone, “if you don’t order that idiot backon the ground, the teacher’s going to get back and—”“Come and get it, Hufflepuffle!” shouted Mr. Goyle, and a great cheerwent up from the Slytherins.“I can’t!” whispered Draco. “Everyone in Slytherin would think I’mweak!”“And if Mr. Goyle gets expelled,” hissed Harry, “your father is going tothink you’re a moron!”Draco’s face twisted in agony.At that moment—“Hey, Slytherslime,” shouted Ernie, “didn’t anyone ever tell you thatHufflepuffs stick together? Wands out, Hufflepuff!”And there were suddenly a whole lot of wands pointed in Mr. Goyle’sdirection.Three seconds later—“Wands out, Slytherin!” said around five different Slytherins.And there were a whole lot of wands pointed in Hufflepuff’s direction.Two seconds later—“Wands out, Gryffindor!”“Do something, Potter!” whispered Draco. “I can’t be the one to stop this ithas to be you! I’ll owe you a favour just think of something aren’t you supposed tobe brilliant?”In around five and a half seconds, realised Harry, someone was going to cast the Sumerian Simple Strike Hex and by the time it was over222 *and the teachers were done expelling people the only boys left in his yearwould be Ravenclaws.“Wands out, Ravenclaw!” shouted Michael Corner who was apparentlyfeeling left out of the disaster.“GREGORY GOYLE!” screamed Harry. “I challenge you to a contest forpossession of Neville’s Remembrall!”There was a sudden pause.“Oh, really?” said Draco in the loudest drawl Harry had ever heard.“That sounds interesting. What sort of contest, Potter?”Er…“Contest” had been as far as Harry’s inspiration had gotten. What sortof contest, he couldn’t say “chess” because Draco wouldn’t be able to accept without it looking strange, he couldn’t say “arm-wrestling” becauseMr. Goyle would crush him—“How about this?” Harry said loudly. “Gregory Goyle and I stand apartfrom each other, and no one else is allowed to come near either of us. Wedon’t use our wands and neither does anyone else. I don’t move fromwhere I’m standing, and neither does he. And if I can get my hands onNeville’s Remembrall, then Gregory Goyle relinquishes all claim to thatRemembrall he’s holding and gives it to me.”There was another pause as people’s looks of relief transmuted to confusion.“Hah, Potter!” said Draco loudly. “I’d like to see you do that! Mr. Goyleaccepts!”“It’s on!” said Harry.“Potter, what?” whispered Draco, which he somehow did withoutmoving his lips.Harry didn’t know how to answer without moving his.People were putting their wands away, and Mr. Goyle swooped gracefully to the ground, looking rather confused. Some Hufflepuffs startedover towards Mr. Goyle, but Harry shot them a desperately pleading lookand they backed off.Harry walked toward Mr. Goyle and stopped when he was a few pacesaway, far enough apart that they couldn’t reach each other.Slowly, deliberately, Harry sheathed his wand.223 *Everyone else backed away.Harry swallowed. He knew in broad outline what he wanted to do, butit had to be done in such a way that no one understood what he’d done—“All right,” Harry said loudly. “And now…” He took a deep breath andraised one hand, fingers ready to snap. There were gasps from anyonewho’d heard about the pies, which was practically everyone. “I call upon theinsanity of Hogwarts! Happy happy boom boom swamp swamp swamp!” AndHarry snapped his fingers.A lot of people flinched.And nothing happened.Harry let the silence stretch on for a while, developing, until…“Um,” someone said. “Is that it?”Harry looked at the boy who’d spoken. “Look in front of you. You seethat patch of ground that looks barren, without any grass on it?”“Um, yeah,” said the boy, a Gryffindor (Dean something?).“Dig it up.”Now Harry was getting a lot of strange looks.“Er, why?” said Dean something.“Just do it,” said Terry Boot in a weary voice. “No point asking why,trust me on this one.”Dean something kneeled down and began to scoop away dirt.After a minute or so, Dean stood up again. “There’s nothing there,”Dean said.Huh. Harry had been planning to go back in time and bury a treasure map that would lead to another treasure map that would lead toNeville’s Remembrall which he would put there after getting it back fromMr. Goyle…Then Harry realised there was a much simpler way which didn’tthreaten the secret of Time-Turners quite as much.“Thanks, Dean!” Harry said loudly. “Ernie, would you look aroundon the ground where Neville fell and see if you can find Neville’s Remembrall?”People looked even more confused.“Just do it,” said Terry Boot. “He’ll keep trying until something works,and the scary thing is that—”224 *“Merlin!” gasped Ernie. He was holding up Neville’s Remembrall. “It’shere! Right where he fell!”“What?” cried Mr. Goyle. He looked down and saw……that he was still holding Neville’s Remembrall.There was a rather long pause.“Er,” said Dean something, “that’s not possible, is it?”“It’s a plot hole,” said Harry. “I made myself weird enough to distractthe universe for a moment and it forgot that Goyle had already picked upthe Remembrall.”“No, wait, I mean, that’s totally not possible—”“Excuse me, are we all standing around here waiting to go flying onbroomsticks? Yes we are. So shut up. Anyway, once I get my hands onNeville’s Remembrall, the contest is over and Gregory Goyle has to relinquish all claim to the Remembrall he’s holding and give it to me. Thosewere the terms, remember?” Harry stretched out a hand and beckonedErnie. “Just roll it over here, since no one’s supposed to get close to me,okay?”“Hold on!” shouted a Slytherin—Blaise Zabini, Harry wasn’t likely toforget that name. “How do we know that’s Neville’s Remembrall? Youcould’ve just dropped another Remembrall there—”“The Slytherin is strong with this one,” Harry said, smiling. “But youhave my word that the one Ernie’s holding is Neville’s. No comment aboutthe one Gregory Goyle’s holding.”Zabini spun to Draco. “Malfoy! You’re not just going to let him getaway with that—”“Shut up, you,” rumbled Mr. Crabbe, standing behind Draco. “Mr. Malfoy doesn’t need you to tell him what to do!”Good minion.“My bet was with Draco, of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy,” Harry said. “Not with you, Zabini. I have done what Mr. Malfoy saidhe’d like to see me do, and as for the judgment of the bet, I leave that upto Mr. Malfoy.” Harry inclined his head towards Draco and raised his eyebrows slightly. That ought to allow Draco to save enough face.There was a pause.“You promise that actually is Neville’s Remembrall?” Draco said.225 *“Yes,” Harry said. “That’s the one that’ll go back to Neville and it washis originally. And the one Gregory Goyle’s holding goes to me.”Draco nodded, looking decisive. “I won’t question the word of the Noble House of Potter, then, no matter how strange that all was. And the Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy keeps its word as well. Mr. Goyle,give that to Mr. Potter—”“Hey!” Zabini said. “He hasn’t won yet, he hasn’t got his hands on—”“Catch, Harry!” said Ernie, and he tossed the Remembrall.Harry easily snapped the Remembrall out of the air, he’d always hadgood reflexes that way. “There,” said Harry, “I win…”Harry trailed off. All conversation stopped.The Remembrall was glowing bright red in his hand, blazing like aminiature sun that cast shadows on the ground in broad daylight.Thursday.If you wanted to be specific, 5:09pm on Thursday afternoon, in Professor McGonagall’s office, after flying classes. (With an extra hour forHarry slipped in between.)Professor McGonagall sitting on her stool. Harry in the hot seat infront of her desk.“Professor,” Harry said tightly, “Slytherin was pointing their wands atHufflepuff, Gryffindor was pointing their wands at Slytherin, some idiotcalled wands out in Ravenclaw, and I had maybe five seconds to keep thewhole thing from blowing sky-high! It was all I could think of!”Professor McGonagall’s face was pinched and angry. “You are not touse the Time-Turner in that fashion, Mr. Potter! Is the concept of secrecy notsomething that you understand?”“They don’t know how I did it! They just think I can do really weirdthings by snapping my fingers! I’ve done other weird stuff that can’t bedone with Time-Turners even, and I’ll do more stuff like that, and this casewon’t even stand out! I had to do it, Professor!”226 *“You did not have to do it!” snapped Professor McGonagall. “All youneeded to do was get this anonymous Slytherin back on the ground and thewands put away! You could have challenged him to a game of ExplodingSnap but no, you had to use the Time-Turner in a flagrant and unnecessary manner!”“It was all I could think of! I don’t even know what Exploding Snapis, they wouldn’t have accepted a game of chess and if I’d picked armwresting I would have lost!”“Then you should have picked wrestling!”Harry blinked. “But then I’d have lost—”Harry stopped.Professor McGonagall was looking very angry.“I’m sorry, Professor McGonagall,” Harry said in a small voice. “I honestly didn’t think of that, and you’re right, I should have, it would havebeen brilliant if I had, but I just didn’t think of that at all…”Harry’s voice trailed off. It was suddenly apparent to him that he’dhad a lot of other options. He could have asked Draco to suggest something, he could have asked the crowd… his use of the Time-Turner hadbeen flagrant and unnecessary. There had been a giant space of possibilities, why had he picked that one?Because he’d seen a way to win. Win possession of an unimportanttrinket that the teachers would’ve taken back from Mr. Goyle anyway.Intent to win. That was what had gotten him.“I’m sorry,” Harry said again. “For my pride and my stupidity.”Professor McGonagall wiped a hand across her forehead. Some of heranger seemed to dissipate. But her voice still came out very hard. “Onemore display like that, Mr. Potter, and you will be returning that TimeTurner. Do I make myself very clear?”“Yes,” Harry said. “I understand and I’m sorry.”“Then, Mr. Potter, you will be allowed to retain the Time-Turner fornow. And considering the size of the debacle you did, in fact, avert, I willnot deduct any points from Ravenclaw.”Plus you couldn’t explain why you’d deducted the points. But Harry wasn’tdumb enough to say that out loud.227 *“More importantly, why did the Remembrall go off like that?” Harrysaid. “Does it mean I’ve been Obliviated?”“That puzzles me as well,” Professor McGonagall said slowly. “If itwere that simple, I would think that the courts would use Remembralls,and they do not. I shall look into it, Mr. Potter.” She sighed. “You can gonow.”Harry started to get up from his chair, then halted. “Um, sorry, I didhave something else I wanted to tell you—”You could hardly see the flinch. “What is it, Mr. Potter?”“It’s about Professor Quirrell—”“I’m sure, Mr. Potter, that it is nothing of importance.” ProfessorMcGonagall spoke the words in a great rush. “Surely you heard the Headmaster tell the students that you were not to bother us with any unimportant complaints about the Defence Professor?”Harry was rather confused. “But this could be important, yesterday Igot this sudden sense of doom when—”“Mr. Potter! I have a sense of doom as well! And my sense of doom issuggesting that you must not finish that sentence!”Harry’s mouth gaped open. Professor McGonagall had succeeded;Harry was speechless.“Mr. Potter,” said Professor McGonagall, “if you have discovered anything that seems interesting about Professor Quirrell, please feel free notto share it with me or anyone else. Now I think you’ve taken up enoughof my valuable time—”“This isn’t like you!” Harry burst out. “I’m sorry but that just seemsunbelievably irresponsible! From what I’ve heard there’s some kind of jinxon the Defence position, and if you already know something’s going to gowrong, I’d think you’d all be on your toes—”“Go wrong, Mr. Potter? I certainly hope not.” Professor McGonagall’sface was expressionless. “After Professor Blake was caught in a closetwith no fewer than three fifth-year Slytherins last February, and a yearbefore that, Professor Summers failed so completely as an educator thather students thought a boggart was a kind of furniture, it would be catastrophic if some problem with the extraordinarily competent Professor228 *Quirrell came to my attention now, and I daresay most of our studentswould fail their Defence O.W.L.s and N.E.W.T.s.”“I see,” Harry said slowly, taking it all in. “So in other words, whatever’s wrong with Professor Quirrell, you desperately don’t want to knowabout it until the end of the school year. And since it’s currently September, he could assassinate the Prime Minister on live television and getaway with it so far as you’re concerned.”Professor McGonagall gazed at him unblinkingly. “I am certain thatI could never be heard endorsing such a statement, Mr. Potter. At Hogwarts we strive to be proactive with respect to anything that threatens theeducational attainment of our students.”Such as first-year Ravenclaws who can’t keep their mouths shut. “I believe Iunderstand you completely, Professor McGonagall.”“Oh, I doubt that, Mr. Potter. I doubt that very much.” ProfessorMcGonagall leaned forward, her face tightening again. “Since you andI have already discussed matters far more sensitive than these, I shallspeak frankly. You, and you alone, have reported this mysterious sense ofdoom. You, and you alone, are a chaos magnet the likes of which I havenever seen. After our little shopping trip to Diagon Alley, and then theSorting Hat, and then today’s little episode, I can well foresee that I amfated to sit in the Headmaster’s office and hear some hilarious tale aboutProfessor Quirrell in which you and you alone play a starring role, afterwhich there will be no choice but to fire him. I am already resigned toit, Mr. Potter. And if this sad event takes place any earlier than the Idesof May, I will string you up by the gates of Hogwarts with your own intestines and pour fire beetles into your nose. Now do you understand mecompletely?”Harry nodded, his eyes very wide. Then, after a second, “What do Iget if I can make it happen on the last day of the school year?”“Get out of my office!”Thursday.There must have been something about Thursdays in Hogwarts.229 *It was 5:32pm on Thursday afternoon, and Harry was standing nextto Professor Flitwick, in front of the great stone gargoyle that guardedthe entrance to the Headmaster’s office.No sooner had he made it back from Professor McGonagall’s office tothe Ravenclaw study rooms than one of the students told him to report toProfessor Flitwick’s office, and there Harry had learned that Dumbledorewanted to speak to him.Harry, feeling rather apprehensive, had asked Professor Flitwick ifthe Headmaster had said what this was about.Professor Flitwick had shrugged in a helpless sort of way.Apparently Dumbledore had said that Harry was far too young to invoke the words of power and madness.Happy happy boom boom swamp swamp swamp? Harry had thought butnot said aloud.“Please don’t worry too much, Mr. Potter,” squeaked ProfessorFlitwick from somewhere around Harry’s shoulder level. (Harry wasgrateful for Professor Flitwick’s gigantic puffy beard, it was hard gettingused to a Professor who was not only shorter than him but spoke in ahigher-pitched voice.) “Headmaster Dumbledore may seem a little odd,or a lot odd, or even extremely odd, but he has never hurt a student in theslightest, and I don’t believe he ever will.” Professor Flitwick gave Harryan encouraging smile. “Just keep that in mind at all times and you’ll besure not to panic!”This was not helping.“Good luck!” squeaked Professor Flitwick, and leaned over to the gargoyle and said something that Harry somehow failed to hear at all. (Ofcourse, the password wouldn’t be much good if you could hear someonesaying it.) And the stone gargoyle walked aside with a very natural andordinary movement that Harry found rather shocking, since the gargoylestill looked like solid, immovable stone the whole time.Behind the gargoyle was a set of slowly revolving spiral stairs. Therewas something disturbingly hypnotic about it, and even more disturbingwas that revolving the spiral ought not to take you anywhere.“Up you go!” squeaked Flitwick.230 *Harry rather nervously stepped onto the spiral, and found himself,for some reason that his brain couldn’t seem to visualise at all, movingupwards.The gargoyle thudded back into place behind him, and the spiral stairskept turning and Harry kept being higher up, and after a rather dizzyingtime, Harry found himself in front of an oak door with a brass griffinknocker.Harry reached out and turned the doorknob.The door swung open.And Harry saw the most interesting room he’d ever seen in his life.There were tiny metal mechanisms that whirred or ticked or slowlychanged shape or emitted little puffs of smoke. There were dozens ofmysterious fluids in dozens of oddly shaped containers, all bubbling, boiling, oozing, changing color, or forming into interesting shapes that vanished half a second after you saw them. There were things that looked likeclocks with many hands, inscribed with numbers or in unrecognisablelanguages. There was a bracelet bearing a lenticular crystal that sparkledwith a thousand colors, and a bird perched atop a golden platform, anda wooden cup filled with what looked like blood, and a statue of a falconencrusted in black enamel. The wall was all hung with pictures of peoplesleeping, and the Sorting Hat was casually poised on a hatrack that wasalso holding two umbrellas and three red slippers for left feet.In the midst of all the chaos was a clean black oaken desk. Beforethe desk was an oaken stool. And behind the desk was a well-cushionedthrone containing Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, who wasadorned with a long silver beard, a hat like a squashed giant mushroom,and what looked to Muggle eyes like three layers of bright pink pyjamas.Dumbledore was smiling, and his bright eyes twinkled with a madintensity.With some trepidation, Harry seated himself in front of the desk. Thedoor swung shut behind him with a loud thunk.“Hello, Harry,” said Dumbledore.“Hello, Headmaster,” Harry replied. So they were on a first-name basis? Would Dumbledore now say to call him—“Please, Harry!” said Dumbledore. “Headmaster sounds so formal.Just call me Heh for short.”“I’ll be sure to, Heh,” said Harry.There was a slight pause.“Do you know,” said Dumbledore, “you’re the first person who’s evertaken me up on that?”“Ah…” Harry said. He tried to control his voice despite the suddensinking feeling in his stomach. “I’m sorry, I, ah, Headmaster, you toldme to do it so I did—”“Heh, please!” said Dumbledore cheerfully. “And there’s no call to beso worried, I won’t launch you out a window just because you make onemistake. I’ll give you plenty of warnings first, if you’re doing somethingwrong! Besides, what matters isn’t how people talk to you, it’s what theythink of you.”He’s never hurt a student, just keep remembering that and you’ll be sure notto panic.Dumbledore drew forth a small metal case and flipped it open, showing some small yellow lumps. “Sherbet lemon?” said the Headmaster.“Er, no thank you, Heh,” said Harry. Does slipping a student LSD countas hurting them, or does that fall into the category of harmless fun? “You, um,said something about my being too young to invoke the words of powerand madness?”“That you most certainly are!” Dumbledore said. “Thankfully theWords of Power and Madness were lost seven centuries ago and no onehas the slightest idea what they are anymore. It was just a little remark.”“Ah…” Harry said. He was aware that his mouth was hanging open.“Why did you call me here, then?”“Why?” Dumbledore repeated. “Ah, Harry, if I went around all dayasking why I do things, I’d never have time to get a single thing done! I’mquite a busy person, you know.”Harry nodded, smiling. “Yes, it was a very impressive list. Headmaster of Hogwarts, Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, and Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards. Sorry to ask but Iwas wondering, is it possible to get more than six hours if you use more232 *than one Time-Turner? Because it’s pretty impressive if you’re doing allthat on just thirty hours a day.”There was another slight pause, during which Harry went on smiling. He was a little apprehensive, actually a lot apprehensive, but onceit had become clear that Dumbledore was deliberately messing with him,something within him absolutely refused to sit and take it like a defencelesslump.“I’m afraid Time doesn’t like being stretched out too much,” said Dumbledore after the slight pause, “and yet we ourselves seem to be a little toolarge for it, and so it’s a constant struggle to fit our lives into Time.”“Indeed,” Harry said with grave solemnity. “That’s why it’s best tocome to our points quickly.”For a moment Harry wondered if he’d gone too far.Then Dumbledore chuckled. “Straight to the point it shall be.” TheHeadmaster leaned forwards, tilting his squashed mushroom hat andbrushing his beard against his desk. “Harry, this Monday you did something that should have been impossible even with a Time-Turner. Orrather, impossible with only a Time-Turner. Where did those two piescome from, I wonder?”A jolt of adrenaline shot through Harry. He’d done that using theCloak of Invisibility, the one that had been given him in a Christmas boxalong with a note, and that note had said: If Dumbledore saw a chance topossess one of the Deathly Hallows he would never let it escape his grasp….“A natural thought,” Dumbledore went on, “is that since none ofthe first-years present were able to cast such a spell, someone else waspresent, and yet unseen. And if no one could see them, why, it would beeasy enough for them to throw the pies. One might further suspect thatsince you had a Time-Turner, you were the invisible one; and that sincethe spell of Disillusionment is far beyond your current abilities, you hadan invisibility cloak.” Dumbledore smiled conspiratorially. “Am I on theright track so far, Harry?”Harry was frozen. He had the feeling that an outright lie would notat all be wise, and possibly not the least bit helpful, and he couldn’t thinkof anything else to say.233 *Dumbledore waved a friendly hand. “Don’t worry, Harry, you haven’tdone anything wrong. Invisibility cloaks aren’t against the rules—I suppose they’re rare enough that no one ever got around to putting them onthe list. But really I was wondering something else entirely.”“Oh?” Harry said in the most normal voice he could manage.Dumbledore’s eyes shone with enthusiasm. “You see, Harry, afteryou’ve been through a few adventures you tend to catch the hang of thesethings. You start to see the pattern, hear the rhythm of the world. Youbegin to harbour suspicions before the moment of revelation. You arethe Boy-Who-Lived, and somehow an invisibility cloak made its way intoyour hands only four days after you discovered our magical Britain. Suchcloaks are not for sale in Diagon Alley, but there is one which might findits own way to a destined wearer. And so I cannot help but wonder ifby some strange chance you have found not just an invisibility cloak, butthe Cloak of Invisibility, one of the three Deathly Hallows and reputed tohide the wearer from the gaze of Death himself.” Dumbledore’s gaze wasbright and eager. “May I see it, Harry?”Harry swallowed. There was a full flood of adrenaline in his systemnow and it was entirely useless, this was the most powerful wizard in theworld and there was no way he could make it out the door and there wasnowhere in Hogwarts for him to hide if he did, he was about to lose theCloak that had been passed down through the Potters for who knew howlong—Slowly Dumbledore leaned back into his high chair. The bright lighthad gone out of his eyes, and he looked puzzled and a little sorrowful.“Harry,” said Dumbledore, “if you don’t want to, you can just say no.”“I can?” Harry croaked.“Yes, Harry,” said Dumbledore. His voice sounded sad now, and worried. “It seems that you’re afraid of me, Harry. May I ask what I’ve doneto earn your distrust?”Harry swallowed. “Is there some way you can swear a binding magicaloath that you won’t take my cloak?”Dumbledore shook his head slowly. “Unbreakable Vows are not to beused so lightly. And besides, Harry, if you did not already know the spell,you would have only my word that the spell was binding. Yet surely you234 *realise that I do not need your permission to see the Cloak. I am powerfulenough to draw it forth myself, mokeskin pouch or no.” Dumbledore’sface was very grave. “But this I will not do. The Cloak is yours, Harry. Iwill not seize it from you. Not even to look at for just a moment, unlessyou decide to show it to me. That is a promise and an oath. Should I needto prohibit you from using it on the school grounds, I will require you togo to your vault at Gringotts and store it there.”“Ah…” Harry said. He swallowed hard, trying to calm the flood ofadrenaline and think reasonably. He took the mokeskin pouch off hisbelt. “If you really don’t need my permission… then you have it.” Harryheld out the pouch to Dumbledore, and bit down hard on his lip, sendingthat signal to himself in case he was Obliviated afterwards.The old wizard reached into the pouch, and without saying any wordof retrieval, drew forth the Cloak of Invisibility.“Ah,” breathed Dumbledore. “I was right…” He poured the shimmering black velvet mesh through his hand. “Centuries old, and still as perfect as the day it was made. We have lost much of our art over the years,and now I cannot make such a thing myself, no one can. I can feel thepower of it like an echo in my mind, like a song forever being sung without anyone to hear it…” The wizard looked up from the Cloak. “Do not sellit,” he said, “do not give it to anyone as a possession. Think twice beforeyou show it to anyone, and ponder three times again before you revealit is a Deathly Hallow. Treat it with respect, for this is indeed a Thing ofPower.”For a moment Dumbledore’s face grew wistful……and then he handed the Cloak back to Harry.Harry put it back in his pouch.Dumbledore’s face was grave once more. “May I ask again, Harry, howyou came to distrust me so?”Suddenly Harry felt rather ashamed.“There was a note with the Cloak,” Harry said in a small voice. “It saidthat you would try to take the Cloak from me, if you knew. I don’t knowwho left the note, though, I really don’t.”“I… see,” Dumbledore said slowly. “Well, Harry, I won’t impugn themotives of whoever left you that note. Who knows but that they them*235 *selves may have had the best of good intentions? They did give you theCloak, after all.”Harry nodded, impressed by Dumbledore’s charity, and abashed atthe sharp contrast with his own attitude.The old wizard went on. “But you and I are both gamepieces of thesame color, I think. The boy who finally defeated Voldemort, and the oldman who held him off long enough for you to save the day. I will not holdyour caution against you, Harry, we must all do our best to be wise. I willonly ask that you think twice and ponder three times again, the next timesomeone tells you to distrust me.”“I’m sorry,” Harry said. He felt wretched at this point, he’d just toldoff Gandalf essentially, and Dumbledore’s kindness was only making himfeel worse. “I shouldn’t have distrusted you.”“Alas, Harry, in this world…” The old wizard shook his head. “I cannoteven say you were unwise. You did not know me. And in truth there aresome at Hogwarts who you would do well not to trust. Perhaps even someyou call friends.”Harry swallowed. That sounded rather ominous. “Like who?”Dumbledore stood up from his chair, and began examining one of hisinstruments, a dial with eight hands of varying length.After a few moments, the old wizard spoke again. “He probablyseems to you quite charming,” said Dumbledore. “Polite—to you at least.Well-spoken, maybe even admiring. Always ready with a helping hand, afavour, a word of advice—”“Oh, Draco Malfoy!” Harry said, feeling rather relieved that it wasn’tHermione or something. “Oh no, no no no, you’ve got it all wrong, he’snot turning me, I’m turning him.”Dumbledore froze where he was peering at the dial. “You’re what?”“I’m going to turn Draco Malfoy from the Dark Side,” Harry said. “Youknow, make him a good guy.”Dumbledore straightened and turned to Harry. He was wearing oneof the most astonished expressions Harry had ever seen on anyone, letalone someone with a long silver beard. “Are you certain,” said the oldwizard after a moment, “that he is ready to be redeemed? I fear that what*236 *ever goodness you think you see within him is only wishful thinking—orworse, a lure, a bait—”“Er, not likely,” Harry said. “I mean if he’s trying to disguise himself asa good guy he’s incredibly bad at it. This isn’t a question of Draco comingup to me and being all charming and me deciding that he must have a hidden core of goodness deep down. I selected him for redemption specifically because he’s the heir to House Malfoy and if you had to pick oneperson to redeem, it would obviously be him.”Dumbledore’s left eye twitched. “You intend to sow seeds of love andkindness in Draco Malfoy’s heart because you expect Malfoy’s heir toprove valuable to you?”“Not just to me!” Harry said indignantly. “To all of magical Britain, ifthis works out! And he’ll have a happier and mentally healthier life himself! Look, I don’t have enough time to turn everyone away from the DarkSide and I’ve got to ask where the Light can gain the most advantage thefastest—”Dumbledore started laughing. Laughing a lot harder than Harrywould expect, almost howling. It seemed positively undignified. An ancient and powerful wizard ought to chuckle in deep booming tones, notlaugh so hard he was gasping for breath. Harry had once literally fallenout of his chair while watching the Marx Brothers movie Duck Soup, andthat was how hard Dumbledore was laughing now.“It’s not that funny,” Harry said after a while. He was starting to worryabout Dumbledore’s sanity again.Dumbledore got himself under control again with a visible effort. “Ah,Harry, one symptom of the disease called wisdom is that you begin laughing at things that no one else thinks is funny, because when you’re wise,Harry, you start getting the jokes!” The old wizard wiped tears away fromhis eyes. “Ah, me. Ah, me. Oft evil will shall evil mar indeed, in very deed.”Harry’s brain took a moment to place the familiar words… “Hey, that’sa Tolkien quote! Gandalf says that!”“Theoden, actually,” said Dumbledore.“You’re Muggleborn?” Harry said in shock.“I’m afraid not,” said Dumbledore, smiling again. “I was born seventyyears before that book was published, dear child. But it seems that my237 *Muggleborn students tend to think alike in certain ways. I have accumulated no fewer than twenty copies of The Lord of the Rings and three sets ofTolkien’s entire collected works, and I treasure every one of them.” Dumbledore drew his wand and held it up and struck a pose. “You cannot pass!How does that look?”“Ah,” Harry said in something approaching complete brain shutdown,“I think you’re missing a Balrog.” And the pink pyjamas and squashedmushroom hat were not helping in the slightest.“I see.” Dumbledore sighed and glumly sheathed the wand in his belt.“I fear there have been precious few Balrogs in my life of late. Nowadays it’s all meetings of the Wizengamot where I must try desperately toprevent any work from getting done, and formal dinners where foreignpoliticians compete to see who can be the most obstinate fool. And beingmysterious at people, knowing things I have no way of knowing, makingcryptic statements which can only be understood in hindsight, and all theother small ways in which powerful wizards amuse themselves after theyhave left the part of the pattern that allows them to be heroes. Speakingof which, Harry, I have a certain something to give you, something whichbelonged to your father.”“You do?” said Harry. “Gosh, who would have figured.”“Yes indeed,” said Dumbledore. “I suppose it is a little predictable,isn’t it?” His face turned solemn. “Nonetheless…”Dumbledore went back to his desk and sat down, pulling out one ofthe drawers as he did so. He reached in using both arms, and, strainingslightly, pulled a rather large and heavy-looking object out of the drawer,which he then deposited on his oaken desk with a huge thunk.“This,” Dumbledore said, “was your father’s rock.”Harry stared at it. It was light gray, discolored, irregularly shaped,sharp-edged, and very much a plain old ordinary large rock. Dumbledorehad deposited it so that it rested on the widest available cross-section, butit still wobbled unstably on his desk.Harry looked up. “This is a joke, right?”“It is not,” said Dumbledore, shaking his head and looking very serious. “I took this from the ruins of James and Lily’s home in Godric’s238 *Hollow, where also I found you; and I have kept it from then until now,against the day when I could give it to you.”In the mixture of hypotheses that served as Harry’s model of theworld, Dumbledore’s insanity was rapidly rising in probability. Butthere was still a substantial amount of probability allocated to otheralternatives… “Um, is it a magical rock?”“Not so far as I know,” said Dumbledore. “But I advise you withthe greatest possible stringency to keep it close about your person at alltimes.”All right. Dumbledore was probably insane but if he wasn’t… well, itwould be just too embarrassing to get in trouble from ignoring the adviceof the inscrutable old wizard. That had to be like #4 on the list of the Top100 Obvious Failure Modes.Harry stepped forward and put his hands on the rock, trying to findsome angle from which to lift it without cutting himself. “I’ll put it in mypouch, then.”Dumbledore frowned. “That may not be close enough to your person.And what if your mokeskin pouch is lost, or stolen?”“You think I should just carry a big rock everywhere I go?”Dumbledore gave Harry a serious look. “That might prove wise.”“Ah…” Harry said. It looked rather heavy. “I’d think the other studentswould tend to ask me questions about that.”“Tell them I ordered you to do it,” said Dumbledore. “No one will question that, since they all think I’m insane.” His face was still perfectly serious.“Er, to be honest if you go around ordering your students to carrylarge rocks I can kind of see why people would think that.”“Ah, Harry,” said Dumbledore. The old wizard gestured, a sweep ofone hand that seemed to take in all the mysterious instruments aroundthe room. “When we are young we believe that we know everything, andso we believe that if we see no explanation for something, then no explanation exists. When we are older we realise that the whole universe worksby a rhythm and a reason, even if we ourselves do not know it. It is onlyour own ignorance which appears to us as insanity.”“Reality is always lawful,” said Harry, “even if we don’t know the law.”239 *“Precisely, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “To understand this—and I seethat you do understand it—is the essence of wisdom.”“So… why do I have to carry this rock exactly?”“I can’t think of a reason, actually,” said Dumbledore.“…you can’t.”Dumbledore nodded. “But just because I can’t think of a reasondoesn’t mean there is no reason.”The instruments ticked on.“Okay,” said Harry, “I’m not even sure if I should be saying this, butthat is simply not the correct way to deal with our admitted ignorance ofhow the universe works.”“It isn’t?” said the old wizard, looking surprised and disappointed.Harry had the feeling this conversation was not going to work outin his favour, but he carried on regardless. “No. I don’t even know ifthat fallacy has an official name, but if I had to make one up myself, itwould be ‘privileging the hypothesis’ or something like that. How can Iput this formally… um… suppose you had a million boxes, and only oneof the boxes contained a diamond. And you had a box full of diamonddetectors, and each diamond-detector always went off in the presence ofa diamond, and went off half the time on boxes that didn’t have a diamond. If you ran twenty detectors over all the boxes, you’d have, on average, one false candidate and one true candidate left. And then it wouldjust take one or two more detectors before you were left with the one truecandidate. The point being that when there are lots of possible answers,most of the evidence you need goes into just locating the true hypothesisout of millions of possibilities—bringing it to your attention in the firstplace. The amount of evidence you need to judge between two or threeplausible candidates is much smaller by comparison. So if you just jumpahead without evidence and promote one particular possibility to the focus of your attention, you’re skipping over most of the work. Like, youlive in a city where there are a million people, and there’s a murder, anda detective says, well, we’ve got no evidence at all, so have we consideredthe possibility that Mortimer Snodgrass did it?”“Did he?” said Dumbledore.240 *“No,” said Harry. “But later it turns out that the murderer had blackhair, and Mortimer has black hair, so everyone’s like, ah, looks like Mortimer did it after all. So it’s unfair to Mortimer for the police to promotehim to their attention without having good reasons already in hand to suspect him. When there are lots of possibilities, most of the work goes intojust locating the true answer—starting to pay attention to it. You don’tneed proof, or the sort of official evidence that scientists or courts demand,but you need some sort of hint, and that hint has to discriminate that particular possibility from the millions of others. Otherwise you can’t justpluck the right answer out of thin air. You can’t even pluck a possibility worth thinking about out of thin air. And there’s got to be a millionother things I could do besides carrying around my father’s rock. Justbecause I’m ignorant about the universe doesn’t mean that I’m unsureabout how I should reason in the presence of my uncertainty. The lawsfor thinking with probabilities are no less iron than the laws that governold-fashioned logic, and what you just did is not allowed.” Harry paused.“Unless, of course, you have some hint you’re not mentioning.”“Ah,” said Dumbledore. He tapped his cheek, looking thoughtful. “Aninteresting argument, certainly, but doesn’t it break down at the pointwhere you make an analogy between a million potential murderers onlyone of whom committed the murder, and taking one out of many possiblecourses of action, when many possible courses of action may all be wise?I do not say that carrying your father’s rock is the one best possible courseof action, only that it is wiser to do than not.”Dumbledore once again reached into the same desk drawer he had accessed earlier, this time seeming to root around inside—at least his armseemed to be moving. “I will remark,” Dumbledore said while Harry wasstill trying to sort out how to reply to this completely unexpected rejoinder, “that it is a common misconception of Ravenclaws that all the smartchildren are Sorted there, leaving none for other Houses. This is not so;being Sorted to Ravenclaw indicates that you are driven by your desireto know things, which is not at all the same quality as being intelligent.”The wizard was smiling as he bent over the drawer. “Nonetheless, you doseem rather intelligent. Less like an ordinary young hero and more likea young mysterious ancient wizard. I think I may have been taking thewrong approach with you, Harry, and that you may be able to understandthings that few others could grasp. So I shall be daring, and offer you acertain other heirloom.”“You don’t mean…” gasped Harry. “My father… owned another rock?”“Excuse me,” said Dumbledore, “I am still older and more mysteriousthan you and if there are any revelations to be made then I will do the revealing, thank you… oh, where is that thing!” Dumbledore reached downfurther into the desk drawer, and still further. His head and shouldersand whole torso disappeared inside until only his hips and legs were sticking out, as though the desk drawer was eating him.Harry couldn’t help but wonder just how much stuff was in there andwhat the complete inventory would look like.Finally Dumbledore rose back up out of the drawer, holding the objective of his search, which he set down on the desk alongside the rock.It was a used, ragged-edged, worn-spined textbook: Intermediate Potion Making by Libatius Borage. There was a picture of a smoking vial onthe cover.“This,” Dumbledore intoned, “was your mother’s fifth-year Potionstextbook.”“Which I am to carry with me at all times,” said Harry.“Which holds a terrible secret. A secret whose revelation could prove sodisastrous that I must ask you to swear—and I do require you to swear itseriously, Harry, whatever you may think of all this—never to tell anyoneor anything else.”Harry considered his mother’s fifth-year Potions textbook, which, apparently, held a terrible secret.The problem was that Harry did take that oaths like that very seriously.Any vow was an Unbreakable Vow if made by the right sort of person.And…“I’m feeling thirsty,” Harry said, “and that is not at all a good sign.”Dumbledore entirely failed to ask any questions about this crypticstatement. “Do you swear, Harry?” said Dumbledore. His eyes gazed intently into Harry’s. “Otherwise I cannot tell you.”“Yes,” said Harry. “I swear.” That was the trouble with being a Ravenclaw. You couldn’t refuse an offer like that or your curiosity would eat you242 *alive, and everyone else knew it.“And I swear in turn,” said Dumbledore, “that what I am about to tellyou is the truth.”Dumbledore opened the book, seemingly at random, and Harryleaned in to see.“Do you see these notes,” Dumbledore said in a voice so low it wasalmost a whisper, “written in the margins of the book?”Harry squinted slightly. The yellowing pages seemed to be describing something called a potion of eagle’s splendour, many of the ingredientsbeing items that Harry didn’t recognise at all and whose names didn’t appear to derive from English. Scrawled in the margin was a handwrittenannotation saying, I wonder what would happen if you used Thestral blood hereinstead of blueberries? and immediately beneath was a reply in differenthandwriting, You’d get sick for weeks and maybe die.“I see them,” said Harry. “What about them?”Dumbledore pointed to the second scrawl. “The ones in this handwriting,” he said, still in that low voice, “were written by your mother. And theones in this handwriting,” moving his finger to indicate the first scrawl,“were written by me. I would turn myself invisible and sneak into herdorm room while she was sleeping. Lily thought one of her friends waswriting them and they had the most amazing fights.”That was the exact point at which Harry realised that the Headmasterof Hogwarts was, in fact, crazy.Dumbledore was looking at him with a serious expression. “Do youunderstand the implications of what I have just told you, Harry?”“Ehhh…” Harry said. His voice seemed to be stuck. “Sorry… I… notreally…”“Ah well,” said Dumbledore, and sighed. “I suppose your clevernesshas limits after all, then. Shall we all just pretend I didn’t say anything?”Harry rose from his chair, wearing a fixed smile. “Of course,” Harrysaid. “You know it’s actually getting rather late in the day and I’m a bithungry, so I should be going down to dinner, really” and Harry made abeeline for the door.The doorknob entirely failed to turn.243 *“You wound me, Harry,” said Dumbledore’s voice in quiet tones thatwere coming from right behind him. “Do you not at least realise that whatI have told you is a sign of trust?”Harry slowly turned around.In front of him was a very powerful and very insane wizard with along silver beard, a hat like a squashed giant mushroom, and wearingwhat looked to Muggle eyes like three layers of bright pink pyjamas.Behind him was a door that didn’t seem to be working at the moment.Dumbledore was looking rather saddened and weary, like he wantedto lean on a wizard’s staff he didn’t have. “Really,” said Dumbledore, “youtry anything new instead of following the same pattern every time for ahundred and ten years, and people all start running away.” The old wizard shook his head in sorrow. “I’d hoped for better from you, Harry Potter. I’d heard that your own friends also think you mad. I know they aremistaken. Will you not believe the same of me?”“Please open the door,” Harry said, his voice trembling. “If you everwant me to trust you again, open the door.”There was the sound behind him of a door opening.“There were more things I planned to say to you,” Dumbledore said,“and if you leave now, you will not know what they were.”Sometimes Harry absolutely hated being a Ravenclaw.He’s never hurt a student, said Harry’s Gryffindor side. Just keep remembering that and you’ll be sure not to panic. You’re not going to run away just because things are getting interesting, are you?You can’t just walk out on the Headmaster! said the Hufflepuff part. Whatif he starts deducting House points? He could make your school life very difficultif he decides he doesn’t like you!And a piece of himself which Harry didn’t much like but couldn’t quitemanage to silence was pondering the potential advantages of being oneof the few friends of this mad old wizard who also happened to be Headmaster, Chief Warlock, and Supreme Mugwump. And unfortunately hisinner Slytherin seemed to be much better than Draco at turning peopleto the Dark Side, because it was saying things like poor fellow, he looks likehe needs someone to talk to, doesn’t he? and you wouldn’t want such a powerfulman to end up trusting someone less virtuous, would you? and I wonder what sort244 *of incredible secrets Dumbledore could tell you if, you know, you became friendswith him and even I bet he’s got a reaallly interesting book collection.You’re all a bunch of lunatics, Harry thought at the entire assemblage,but he’d been unanimously outvoted by every component part of himself.Harry turned, took a step towards the open door, reached out, and deliberately closed it again. It was a costless sacrifice given that he was staying anyway, Dumbledore could control his movements regardless, butmaybe it would impress Dumbledore.When Harry turned back around he saw that the powerful insane wizard was once more smiling and looking friendly. That was good, maybe.“Please don’t do that again,” Harry said. “I don’t like being trapped.”“I am sorry about that, Harry,” said Dumbledore in what sounded liketones of sincere apology. “But it would have been terribly unwise to letyou leave without your father’s rock.”“Of course,” Harry said. “It wasn’t reasonable of me to expect the doorto open before I put the quest items in my inventory.”Dumbledore smiled and nodded.Harry went over to the desk, twisted his mokeskin pouch around tothe front of his belt, and, with some effort, managed to heave up the rockin his eleven-year-old arms and feed it in.He could actually feel the weight slowly diminishing as the WideningLip charm ate the rock, and the burp which followed was rather noisy andhad a distinctly complaining sound to it.His mother’s fifth-year Potions textbook (which held a secret that wasin fact pretty terrible) followed shortly after.And then Harry’s inner Slytherin made a sly suggestion for ingratiating himself with the Headmaster, which, unfortunately, had been perfectly pitched in such a way as to gain the support of the majority Ravenclaw faction.“So,” Harry said. “Um. As long as I’m hanging around, I don’t supposeyou would like to give me a bit of a tour of your office? I’m a bit curious asto what some of these things are,” and that was his understatement forthe month of September.Dumbledore gazed at him, and then nodded with a slight grin. “I’mflattered by your interest,” said Dumbledore, “but I’m afraid there isn’t245 *much to say.” Dumbledore took a step closer to the wall and pointed toa painting of a sleeping man. “These are portraits of past Headmastersof Hogwarts.” He turned and pointed to his desk. “This is my desk.” Hepointed to his chair. “This is my chair—”“Excuse me,” Harry said, “actually I was wondering about those.”Harry pointed to a small cube that was softly whispering “blorple…blorple… blorple”.“Oh, the little fiddly things?” said Dumbledore. “They came with theHeadmaster’s office and I have absolutely no idea what most of them do.Although this dial with the eight hands counts the number of, let’s callthem sneezes, by left-handed witches within the borders of France, youwould not believe how much work it took to nail that down. And this onewith the golden wibblers is my own invention and Minerva is never, evergoing to figure out what it’s doing.”Dumbledore took a step over to the hatrack while Harry was still processing this. “Here of course we have the Sorting Hat, I believe the twoof you have met. It told me that it was never again to be placed on yourhead under any circumstances. You’re only the fourteenth student in history it’s said that about, Baba Yaga was another one and I’ll tell you aboutthe other twelve when you’re older. This is an umbrella. This is anotherumbrella.” Dumbledore took another few steps and turned around, nowsmiling quite broadly. “And of course, most people who come to my officewant to see Fawkes.”Dumbledore was standing next to the bird on the golden platform.Harry came over, rather puzzled. “This is Fawkes?”“Fawkes is a phoenix,” said Dumbledore. “Very rare, very powerfulmagical creatures.”“Ah…” Harry said. He lowered his head and stared into the tiny, beadyblack eyes, which showed not the slightest sign of power or intelligence.“Ahhh…” Harry said again.He was pretty sure he recognised the shape of the bird. It was prettyhard to miss.“Umm…”Say something intelligent! Harry’s mind roared at itself. Don’t just standthere sounding like a gibbering moron!246 *Well what the heck am I supposed to say? Harry’s mind fired back.Anything!You mean, anything besides “Fawkes is a chicken”—Yes! Anything but that!“So, ah, what sort of magic do phoenixes do, then?”“Their tears have the power to heal,” Dumbledore said. “They are creatures of fire, and move between all places as easily as fire may extinguishitself in one place and be kindled in another. The tremendous strain oftheir innate magic ages their bodies quickly, and yet they are as closeto undying as any creature that exists in this world, for whenever theirbodies fail them they immolate themselves in a burst of fire and leave behind a hatchling, or sometimes an egg.” Dumbledore came closer andinspected the chicken, frowning. “Hm… looking a little peaky there, I’dsay.”By the time this statement registered fully in Harry’s mind, thechicken was already on fire.The chicken’s beak opened, but it didn’t have time for so much as asingle caw before it began to wither and char. The blaze was brief, intense,and entirely self-contained; there was no smell of burning.And then the fire died down only seconds after it had begun, leavingbehind a tiny, pathetic heap of ashes on the golden platform.“Don’t look so horrified, Harry!” said Dumbledore. “Fawkes hasn’tbeen hurt.” Dumbledore’s hand dipped into a pocket, and then the samehand sifted through the ashes and turned up a small yellowish egg. “Look,here’s an egg!”“Oh… wow… amazing…”“But now we really should get on with things,” Dumbledore said. Leaving the egg behind in the ashes of the chicken, he returned to his throneand seated himself. “It’s almost time for dinner, after all, and we wouldn’twant to have to use our Time-Turners.”There was a violent power struggle going on in the Government ofHarry. Slytherin and Hufflepuff had switched sides after seeing theHeadmaster of Hogwarts set fire to a chicken.“Yes, things,” said Harry’s lips. “And then dinner.”247 *You’re sounding like a gibbering moron again observed Harry’s InternalCritic.“Well,” Dumbledore said. “I fear I have a confession to make, Harry.A confession and an apology.”“Apologies are good” that doesn’t even make sense! What am I talkingabout?The old wizard sighed deeply. “You may not still think so after understanding what I have to say. I’m afraid, Harry, that I’ve been manipulating you your entire life. It was I who consigned you to the care of yourwicked stepparents—”“My stepparents aren’t wicked!” blurted Harry. “My parents, I mean!”“They aren’t?” Dumbledore said, looking surprised and disappointed.“Not even a little wicked? That doesn’t fit the pattern…”Harry’s inner Slytherin screamed at the top of its mental lungs, SHUT“No, no,” said Harry, lips frozen in a ghastly grimace, “I was just tryingto spare your feelings, they’re actually very wicked…”“They are?” Dumbledore leaned forward, gazing at him intently.“What do they do?”Talk fast “they, ah, I have to do dishes and wash problems and theydon’t let me read a lot of books and—”“Ah, good, that’s good to hear,” said Dumbledore, leaning back again.He smiled in a sad sort of way. “I apologise for that, then. Now where wasI? Ah, yes. I’m sorry to say, Harry, that I am responsible for virtually everything bad that has ever happened to you. I know that this will probablymake you very angry.”“Yes, I’m very angry!” said Harry. “Grrr!”Harry’s Internal Critic promptly awarded him the All-Time Award forthe Worst Acting in the History of Ever.“And I just wanted you to know,” Dumbledore said, “I wanted to tellyou as early as possible, in case something happens to one of us later, thatI am truly, truly sorry. For everything that has already happened, andeverything that will.”Moisture glistened in the old wizard’s eyes.248 *“And I’m very angry!” said Harry. “So angry that I want to leave rightnow unless you’ve got anything else to say!”Just GO before he sets you on fire! shrieked Slytherin, Hufflepuff, andGryffindor.“I understand,” said Dumbledore. “One last thing then, Harry. Youare not to attempt the forbidden door on the third-floor corridor. There’sno possible way you could get through all the traps, and I wouldn’t wantto hear that you’d been hurt trying. Why, I doubt that you could so muchas open the first door, since it’s locked and you don’t know the spellAlohomora—”Harry spun around and bolted for the exit at top speed, the doorknobturned agreeably in his hand and then he was racing down the spiralstairs even as they turned, his feet almost stumbling over themselves, injust a moment he was at the bottom and the gargoyle was walking asideand Harry fired out of the stairwell like a cannonball.Harry Potter.There must have been something about Harry Potter.It was Thursday for everyone, after all, and yet this sort of thing didn’tseem to happen to anyone else.It was 6:21pm on Thursday afternoon when Harry Potter, firing out ofthe stairwell like a cannonball and accelerating at top speed, ran directlyinto Minerva McGonagall as she was turning a corner on her way to theHeadmaster’s office.Thankfully neither of them were much hurt. As had been explainedto Harry a little earlier in the day—back when he was refusing to go anywhere near a broomstick again—Quidditch needed solid iron Bludgersjust to stand a decent chance of injuring the players, since wizards tendedto be a lot more resistant than Muggles to impacts.Harry and Professor McGonagall did both end up on the floor, andthe parchments she had been carrying went all over the corridor.There was a terrible, terrible pause.249 *“Harry Potter,” breathed Professor McGonagall from where she waslying on the floor right next to Harry. Her voice rose to nearly a shriek.“What were you doing in the Headmaster’s office?”“Nothing!” squeaked Harry.“Were you talking about the Defence Professor?”“No! Dumbledore called me up there and he gave me this big rock andsaid it was my father’s and I should carry it everywhere!”There was another terrible pause.“I see,” said Professor McGonagall, her voice a little calmer. She stoodup, brushed herself off, and glared at the scattered parchments, whichjumped into a neat stack and scurried back against the corridor wall asthough to hide from her gaze. “My sympathies, Mr. Potter, and I apologise for doubting you.”“Professor McGonagall,” Harry said. His voice was wavering. Hepushed himself off the floor, stood, and looked up at her trustworthy,sane face. “Professor McGonagall…”“Yes, Mr. Potter?”“Do you think I should?” Harry said in a small voice. “Carry my father’s rock everywhere?”Professor McGonagall sighed. “That is between you and the Headmaster, I’m afraid.” She hesitated. “I will say that ignoring the Headmaster completely is almost never wise. I am sorry to hear of your dilemma,Mr. Potter, and if there’s any way I can help you with whatever you decideto do—”“Um,” Harry said. “Actually I was thinking that once I know how, Icould Transfigure the rock into a ring and wear it on my finger. If youcould teach me how to sustain a Transfiguration—”“It is good that you asked me first,” Professor McGonagall said, herface growing a bit stern. “If you lost control of the Transfiguration the reversal would cut off your finger and probably rip your hand in half. Andat your age, even a ring is too large a target for you to sustain indefinitelywithout it being a serious drain on your magic. But I can have a ringforged for you with a setting for a jewel, a small jewel, in contact withyour skin, and you can practice sustaining a safe subject, like a marshmallow. When you have kept it up successfully, even in your sleep, for a250 *full month, I will allow you to Transfigure, ah, your father’s rock…” Professor McGonagall’s voice trailed off. “Did the Headmaster really—”“Yes. Ah… um…”Professor McGonagall sighed. “That’s a bit strange even for him.” Shestooped and picked up the stack of parchments. “I’m sorry about this,Mr. Potter. I apologise again for mistrusting you. But now it’s my ownturn to see the Headmaster.”“Ah… good luck, I guess. Er…”“Thank you, Mr. Potter.”“Um…”Professor McGonagall walked over to the gargoyle, inaudibly spokethe password, and stepped through into the revolving spiral stairs. Shebegan to rise out of sight, and the gargoyle started back—“Professor McGonagall the Headmaster set fire to a chicken!”“He wha—”t was breakfast time on Friday morning. Harry took another huge biteout of his toast and then tried to remind his brain that scarfing hisbreakfast wouldn’t actually get him into the dungeons any faster. Anyway they had a full hour of study time between breakfast and the start ofPotions.But dungeons! In Hogwarts! Harry’s imagination was already sketching the chasms, narrow bridges, torchlit sconces, and patches of glowingmoss. Would there be rats? Would there be dragons?“Harry Potter,” said a quiet voice from behind him.Harry looked over his shoulder and found himself beholding ErnieMacmillan, smartly dressed in yellow-trimmed robes and looking a littleworried.“Neville thought I should warn you,” Ernie said in a low voice. “I thinkhe’s right. Be careful of the Potions Master in our session today. The olderHufflepuffs told us that Professor Snape can be really nasty to people hedoesn’t like, and he doesn’t like most people who aren’t Slytherins. If yousay anything smart to him it… it could be really bad for you, from whatI’ve heard. Just keep your head down and don’t give him any reason tonotice you.”There was a pause as Harry processed this, and then he lifted his eyebrows. (Harry wished he could raise just one eyebrow, like Spock, buthe’d never been able to manage.) “Thanks,” Harry said. “You might’vejust saved me a lot of trouble.”Ernie nodded, and turned to go back to the Hufflepuff table.253 *Harry resumed eating his toast.It was around four bites afterward that someone said “Pardon me,”and Harry turned around to see an older Ravenclaw, looking a littleworried—Some time later, Harry was finishing up his third plate of rashers.(He’d learned to eat heavily at breakfast. He could always eat lightly atlunch if he didn’t end up using the Time-Turner.) And there was yet another voice from behind him saying “Harry?”“Yes,” Harry said wearily, “I’ll try not to draw Professor Snape’sattention—”“Oh, that’s hopeless,” said Fred.“Completely hopeless,” said George.“So we had the house elves bake you a cake,” said Fred.“We’re going to put one candle on it for every point you lose for Ravenclaw,” said George.“And have a party for you at the Gryffindor table during lunch,” saidFred.“We hope that’ll cheer you up afterward,” finished George.Harry swallowed his last bite of rasher and turned around. “All right,”said Harry. “I wasn’t going to ask this after Professor Binns, I reallywasn’t, but if Professor Snape is that awful why hasn’t he been fired?”“Fired?” said Fred.“You mean, let go?” said George.“Yes,” Harry said. “It’s what you do to bad teachers. You fire them.Then you hire a better teacher instead. You don’t have unions or tenurehere, right?”Fred and George were frowning in much the same way that huntergatherer tribal elders might frown if you tried to tell them about calculus.“I don’t know,” said Fred after a while. “I never thought about that.”“Me neither,” said George.“Yeah,” said Harry, “I get that a lot. See you at lunch, guys, and don’tblame me if there aren’t any candles on that cake.”Fred and George both laughed, as if Harry had said something funny,and bowed to him and headed back toward Gryffindor.254 *Harry turned back to the breakfast table and grabbed a cupcake. Hisstomach already felt full, but he had a feeling this morning might use alot of calories.As he ate his cupcake, Harry thought of the worst teacher he’d met sofar, Professor Binns of History. Professor Binns was a ghost. From whatHermione had said about ghosts, it didn’t seem likely that they were fullyself-aware. There were no famous discoveries made by ghosts, or muchof any original work, no matter who they’d been in life. Ghosts tended tohave trouble remembering the current century. Hermione had said theywere like accidental portraits, impressed into the surrounding matter bya burst of psychic energy accompanying a wizard’s sudden death.Harry had run into some stupid teachers during his abortive foraysinto standard Muggle education—his father had been a lot pickier whenit came to selecting grad students as tutors, of course—but History classwas the first time he’d encountered a teacher who literally wasn’t sentient.And it showed, too. Harry had given up after five minutes andstarted reading a textbook. When it became clear that “Professor Binns”wasn’t going to object, Harry had also reached into his pouch and gottenearplugs.Did ghosts not require a salary? Was that it? Or was it literally impossible to fire anyone in Hogwarts even if they died?Now it seemed that Professor Snape was going about being absolutelyawful to everyone who wasn’t a Slytherin and it hadn’t even occurred toanyone to terminate his contract.And the Headmaster had set fire to a chicken.“Excuse me,” came a worried voice from behind him.“I swear,” Harry said without turning around, “this place is almosteight and a half percent as bad as what Dad says about Oxford.”Harry stamped down the stone corridors, looking affronted, annoyed,and infuriated all at once.255 *“Dungeons!” Harry hissed. “Dungeons! These are not dungeons! Thisis a basement! A basement!”Some of the Ravenclaw girls gave him odd looks. The boys were allused to him by now.It seemed that the level in which the Potions classroom was locatedwas called the “dungeons” for no better reason than that it was belowground and slightly colder than the main castle.In Hogwarts! In Hogwarts! Harry had been waiting his whole life andnow he was still waiting and if there was anywhere on the face of the Earththat had decent dungeons it ought to be Hogwarts! Was Harry going tohave to build his own castle if he wanted to see one little bottomless abyss?A short time later they got to the actual Potions classroom and Harrycheered up considerably.The Potions classroom had strange preserved creatures floating inhuge jars on shelves that covered every centimeter of wall space betweenthe closets. Harry had gotten far enough along in his reading now that hecould actually identify some of the creatures, like the Zabriskan Fontema.Albeit the fifty-centimeter spider looked like an Acromantula but it wastoo small to be one. He’d tried asking Hermione, but she hadn’t seemedvery interested in looking anywhere near where he was pointing.Harry was looking at a large dust ball with eyes and feet when theassassin swept into the room.That was the first thought that crossed Harry’s mind when he saw Professor Severus Snape. There was something quiet and deadly about theway the man stalked between the children’s desks. His robes were unkempt, his hair spotted and greasy. There was something about him thatseemed reminiscent of Lucius, although the two of them looked nothingremotely alike, and you got the impression that where Lucius would killyou with flawless elegance, this man would simply kill you.“Sit down,” said Professor Severus Snape. “Now.”Harry and a few other children who had been standing around talkingto each other scrambled for desks. Harry had planned on ending up nextto Hermione but somehow he found himself sitting down in the nearest empty desk next to Justin Finch-Fletchley (it was a Doubles session,256 *Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff) which put him two desks to the left of Hermione.Severus seated himself behind the teacher’s desk, and without theslightest transition or introduction, said, “Hannah Abbott.”“Here,” said Hannah in a somewhat trembling voice.“Susan Bones.”“Present.”And so it went, no one daring to say a word in edgewise, until:“Ah, yes. Harry Potter. Our new… celebrity.”“The celebrity is present, sir.”Half the class flinched, and some of the smarter ones suddenly lookedlike they wanted to run out the door while the classroom was still there.Severus smiled in an anticipatory sort of way and called the next nameon his list.Harry gave a mental sigh. That had happened way too fast for him todo anything about it. Oh well. Clearly this man already didn’t like him,for whatever reason. And when Harry thought about it, better by far thatthis Potions professor should pick on him rather than, say, Neville or Hermione. Harry was a lot better able to defend himself. Yep, probably all forthe best.When full attendance had been taken, Severus swept his gaze over thefull class. His eyes were as empty as a night sky without stars.“You are here,” Severus said in a quiet voice which the students at backstrained to hear, “to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking. As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardlybelieve this is magic. I don’t expect you will really understand the beautyof the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicatepower of liquids that creep through human veins,” this in a rather caressing, gloating tone, “bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses,” this wasjust getting creepier and creepier. “I can teach you how to bottle fame,brew glory, even stopper death—if you aren’t as great a pack of fools as Iusually have to teach.”Severus somehow seemed to notice the look of skepticism on Harry’sface, or at least his eyes suddenly jumped to where Harry was sitting.257 *“Potter!” snapped the Potions professor. “What would I get if I addedpowdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?”Harry blinked. “Was that in Magical Drafts and Potions?” he said. “Ijust finished reading it, and I don’t remember anything which usedwormwood—”Hermione’s hand went up and Harry shot her a glare which causedher to raise her hand even higher.“Tut, tut,” Severus said silkily. “Fame clearly isn’t everything.”“Really?” Harry said. “But you just told us you’d teach us how to bottle fame. Say, how does that work, exactly? You drink it and turn into acelebrity?”Three-quarters of the class flinched.Hermione’s hand was dropping slowly back down. Well, that wasn’tsurprising. She might be his rival, but she wasn’t the sort of girl whowould play along after it became clear that the professor was deliberatelytrying to humiliate him.Harry was trying hard to keep control of his temper. The first rejoinder that had crossed his mind was ‘Abracadabra’.“Let’s try again,” said Severus. “Potter, where would you look if I toldyou to find me a bezoar?”“That’s not in the textbook either,” Harry said, “but in one Mugglebook I read that a trichinobezoar is a mass of solidified hair found in ahuman stomach, and Muggles used to believe it would cure any poison—”“Wrong,” Severus said. “A bezoar is found in the stomach of a goat, itis not made of hair, and it will cure most poisons but not all.”“I didn’t say it would, I said that was what I read in one Mugglebook—”“No one here is interested in your pathetic Muggle books. Final try.What is the difference, Potter, between monksblood and wolfsbane?”That did it.“You know,” Harry said icily, “in one of my quite fascinating Mugglebooks, they describe a study in which people managed to make themselves look very smart by asking questions about random facts that onlythey knew. Apparently the onlookers only noticed that the askers knewand the answerers didn’t, and failed to adjust for the unfairness of the258 *underlying game. So, Professor, can you tell me how many electrons arein the outermost orbital of a carbon atom?”Severus’s smile widened. “Four,” he said. “It is a useless fact whichno one should bother writing down, however. And for your information,Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful itis known as the Draught of Living Death. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite,as you would know if you had read One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi.Thought you didn’t need to open the book before coming, eh, Potter? Allthe rest of you should be copying that down so that you will not be as ignorant as him.” Severus paused, looking quite pleased with himself. “Andthat will be… five points? No, let us make it an even ten points from Ravenclaw for backchat.”Hermione gasped, along with a number of others.“Professor Severus Snape,” Harry bit out. “I know of nothing which Ihave done to earn your enmity. If there is some problem you have withme which I do not know about, I suggest we—”“Shut up, Potter. Ten more points from Ravenclaw. The rest of you,open your books to page 3.”There was only a slight, only a very faint burning sensation in the backof Harry’s throat, and no moisture at all in his eyes. If crying was not aneffective strategy for destroying this Potions professor then there was nopoint in crying.Slowly, Harry sat up very straight. All his blood seemed to have beendrained away and replaced with liquid nitrogen. He knew he’d been trying to keep his temper but he couldn’t seem to remember why.“Harry,” whispered Hermione frantically from two desks over, “stop,please, it’s all right, we won’t count it—”“Talking in class, Granger? Three—”“So,” said a voice colder than zero Kelvin, “how does one go about filing a formal complaint against an abusive professor? Does one talk to theDeputy Headmistress, write a letter to the Board of Governors… wouldyou care to explain how it works?”The class was utterly frozen.259 *“Detention for one month, Potter,” Severus said, smiling even morebroadly.“I decline to recognize your authority as a teacher and I will not serveany detention you give.”People stopped breathing.Severus’s smile vanished. “Then you will be—” his voice stoppedshort.“Expelled, were you about to say?” Harry, on the other hand, was nowsmiling thinly. “But then you seemed to doubt your ability to carry out thethreat, or fear the consequences if you did. I, on the other hand, neitherdoubt nor fear the prospect of finding a school with less abusive professors. Or perhaps I should hire private tutors, as is my accustomed practice, and be taught at my full learning speed. I have enough money in myvault. Something about bounties on a Dark Lord I defeated. But there areteachers at Hogwarts who I rather like, so I think it will be easier if I findsome way to get rid of you instead.”“Get rid of me?” Severus said, now also smiling thinly. “What anamusing conceit. How do you suppose you will do that, Potter?”“I understand there have been a number of complaints about youfrom students and their parents,” a guess but a safe one, “which leavesonly the question of why you’re not already gone. Is Hogwarts too financially strapped to afford a real Potions professor? I could chip in, if so.I’m sure they could find a better class of teacher if they offered doubleyour current salary.”Two poles of ice radiated freezing winter across the classroom.“You will find,” Severus said softly, “that the Board of Governers is notthe slightest bit sympathetic to your offer.”“Lucius…” Harry said. “That’s why you’re still here. Perhaps I shouldchat with Lucius about that. I believe he desires to meet with me. I wonder if I have anything he wants?”Hermione frantically shook her head. Harry noticed out of the cornerof his eye, but his attention was all on Severus.“You are a very foolish boy,” Severus said. He wasn’t smiling at all,now. “You have nothing that Lucius values more than my friendship. Andif you did, I have other allies.” His voice grew hard. “And I find it increas*260 *ingly unlikely that you were not Sorted into Slytherin. How was it thatyou managed to stay out of my House? Ah, yes, because the Sorting Hatclaimed it was joking. For the first time in recorded history. What wereyou really chatting about with the Sorting Hat, Potter? Did you have something that it wanted?”Harry stared into Severus’s cold gaze and remembered that the Sorting Hat had warned him not to meet anyone’s eyes while thinking about—Harry dropped his gaze to Severus’s desk.“You seem oddly reluctant to look me in the eyes, Potter!”A shock of sudden understanding—“So it was you the Sorting Hat waswarning me about!”“What?” said Severus’s voice, sounding genuinely surprised, thoughof course Harry didn’t look at his face.Harry got up out of his desk.“Sit down, Potter,” said an angry voice from somewhere he wasn’tlooking.Harry ignored it, and looked around the classroom. “I have no intention of letting one unprofessional teacher ruin my time at Hogwarts,”Harry said with deadly calm. “I think I’ll take my leave of this class, andeither hire a tutor to teach me Potions while I’m here, or if the Board isreally that locked up, learn over the summer. If any of you decide that youdon’t care to be bullied by this man, my sessions will be open to you.”“Sit down, Potter!”Harry strode across the room and grasped the doorknob.It didn’t turn.Harry slowly turned around, and caught a glimpse of Severus smilingnastily before he remembered to look away.“Open this door.”“No,” said Severus.“You are making me feel threatened,” said a voice so icy it didn’t soundlike Harry’s at all, “and that is a mistake.”Severus’s voice laughed. “What do you intend to do about it, littleboy?”Harry took six long strides forward away from the door, until he wasstanding near the back row of desks.Then Harry drew himself upright and raised his right hand in oneterrible motion, fingers poised to snap.Neville screamed and dived under his desk. Other children shrankback or instinctively raised their arms to shield themselves.“Harry don’t!” shrieked Hermione. “Whatever you were going to do tohim, don’t do it!”“Have you all gone mad?” barked Severus’s voice.Slowly, Harry lowered his hand. “I wasn’t going to hurt him, Hermione,” Harry said, his voice a little lower. “I was just going to blow up thedoor.”Though now that Harry remembered it, you weren’t supposed toTransfigure things that were to be burned, which meant that going backin time afterward and getting Fred or George to Transfigure some carefully measured amount of explosives might not actually have been sucha good idea…“Silencio,” said Severus’s voice.Harry tried to say “What?” and found that no sound was coming out.“This has become ridiculous. I think you’ve been allowed to get yourself in enough trouble for one day, Potter. You are the most disruptiveand unruly student I have ever seen, and I don’t recall how many pointsRavenclaw has right now, but I’m sure I can manage to wipe them allout. Ten points from Ravenclaw. Ten points from Ravenclaw. Ten pointsfrom Ravenclaw! Fifty points from Ravenclaw! Now sit down and watchthe rest of the class take their lesson!”Harry put his hand into his pouch and tried to say ‘marker’ but ofcourse no words came out. For one brief moment that stopped him; andthen it occurred to Harry to spell out M-A-R-K-E-R using finger motions,which worked. P-A-D and he had a pad of paper. Harry strode over to anempty desk, not the one he’d originally sat down in, and scrawled a briefmessage. He tore off that sheet of paper, put away the marker and pad ina pocket of his robes for quicker access, and held up his message, not toSnape, but to the rest of the class.262 *“You’re insane, Potter,” Severus said with cold contempt.Aside from that, no one spoke.Harry swept an ironic bow to the teacher’s desk, walked over to thewall, and with one smooth motion yanked open a closet door, stepped in,and slammed the door shut behind him.There was the muffled sound of someone snapping his fingers, andthen nothing.In the classroom, students looked at each other in puzzlement andfear.The Potions Master’s face was now completely enraged. He crossedthe room in terrible strides and yanked open the closet door.The closet was empty.One hour earlier, Harry listened from inside the closed closet. There wasno sound from outside, and no point in taking risks either.C-L-O-A-K, his fingers spelled out.Once he was invisible, he very carefully and slowly cracked open thecloset door and peeked out. No one seemed to be in the classroom.The door wasn’t locked.It was when Harry was outside the dangerous place and inside thehallway, safely invisible, that some of the anger drained away and he realized what he’d just done.What he’d just done.Harry’s invisible face was frozen in absolute horror.He’d antagonized a teacher three orders of magnitude beyond anything he’d ever managed before. He’d threatened to walk out of Hogwartsand might have to follow through on it. He’d lost all the points Ravenclawhad and then he’d used the Time-Turner…His imagination showed him his parents yelling at him after he wasexpelled, Professor McGonagall disappointed in him, and it was justtoo painful and he couldn’t bear it and he couldn’t think of any way to savehimself—263 *The thought that Harry allowed himself to think was that if gettingangry had gotten him into all this trouble, then maybe when he was angry he’d think of a way out, things seemed clearer somehow when he wasangry.And the thought that Harry didn’t let himself think was that he justcouldn’t face this future if he wasn’t angry.So he cast his thoughts back and remembered the burning humiliation—Tut, tut. Fame clearly isn’t everything.Ten points from Ravenclaw for backchat.The calming cold washed back through his veins like a wave reflectedand returning from some breaker, and Harry let out his breath.Okay. Back to being sane now.He was actually feeling a bit disappointed in his non-angry self forcollapsing like that and wanting only to get out of trouble. ProfessorSeverus Snape was everyone’s problem. Normal-Harry had forgotten thatand wished for a way to protect himself. And let all the other victims gohang? The question wasn’t how to protect himself, the question was howto destroy this Potions professor.So this is my dark side, is it? Bit of a prejudiced term that, my light side seemsmore selfish and cowardly, not to mention confused and panicky.And now that he was thinking clearly, it was equally clear what to donext. He’d already given himself an extra hour to prepare, and could getup to five hours more if required…Minerva McGonagall waited in the Headmaster’s office.Dumbledore sat in his padded throne behind his desk, dressed in fourlayers of formal lavender robes. Minerva sat in a chair before him, opposite Severus in another chair. Facing the three of them was an emptywooden stool.They were waiting for Harry Potter.Harry, Minerva thought despairingly, you promised you wouldn’t bite anyteachers!264 *And in her mind she could see very clearly the reply, Harry’s angryface and his outraged response: I said I wouldn’t bite anyone who didn’t biteme first!There was a knock at the door.“Come in!” Dumbledore called.The door swept open, and Harry Potter entered. Minerva almostgasped out loud. The boy looked cool, collected, and utterly in control ofhimself.“Good mor—” Harry’s voice suddenly cut off. His jaw dropped.Minerva tracked Harry’s gaze, and she saw that Harry was staring atFawkes where the phoenix sat on its golden perch. Fawkes fluttered hisbright red-golden wings like the flickering of a flame, and dipped his headin a measured nod to the boy.Harry turned to stare at Dumbledore.Dumbledore winked at him.Minerva felt she was missing something.Sudden uncertainty crossed Harry’s face. His coolness wavered. Fearshowed in his eyes, then anger, and then the boy was calm again.A chill went down Minerva’s spine. Something was not right here.“Please sit down,” said Dumbledore. His face was now serious oncemore.Harry sat.“So, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “I’ve heard one report of this day fromProfessor Snape. Would you care to tell me what happened in your ownwords?”Harry’s gaze flicked dismissively to Severus. “It’s not complicated,”said the boy, smiling thinly. “He tried bullying me the way he’s been bullying every non-Slytherin in the school since the day Lucius foisted himoff on you. As for the other details, I request a private conversation withyou concerning them. A student who is reporting abusive behavior froma professor can hardly be expected to speak frankly in front of that sameprofessor, after all.”This time Minerva couldn’t stop herself from gasping out loud.Severus simply laughed.265 *And the Headmaster’s face grew grave. “Mr. Potter,” the Headmaster said, “one does not speak of a Hogwarts professor in such terms. Ifear that you labor under a terrible misapprehension. Professor SeverusSnape has my fullest confidence, and serves Hogwarts at my own behest,not Lucius Malfoy’s.”There was silence for a few moments.When the boy spoke again his voice was icy. “Am I missing somethinghere?”“Quite a number of things, Mr. Potter,” said the Headmaster. “Youshould understand, to start with, that the purpose of this meeting is todiscuss how to discipline you for the events of this morning.”“This man has terrorized your school for years. I spoke to studentsand collected stories to make sure there would be enough for a newspapercampaign to rally the parents against him. Some of the younger studentscried while they told me. I almost cried when I heard them! You allowedthis abuser to run free? You did this to your students? Why?”Minerva swallowed a lump in her throat. She’d—thought that, sometimes, but somehow she’d never quite—“Mr. Potter,” said the Headmaster, his voice now stern, “this meeting is not about Professor Snape. It is about you and your disregard forschool discipline. Professor Snape has suggested, and I have agreed, thatthree full months of detention will be appropriate—”“Declined,” Harry said icily.Minerva was speechless.“This is not a request, Mr. Potter,” the Headmaster said. The full,entire force of the wizard’s gaze was turned on the boy. “This is yourpunishme—”“You will explain to me why you allowed this man to hurt the childrenplaced in your care, and if your explanation is not sufficient then I willbegin my newspaper campaign with you as the target.”Minerva’s body swayed with the force of that blow, with the sheer rawlese majeste.Even Severus looked shocked.“That, Harry, would be most extremely unwise,” Dumbledore saidslowly. “I am the primary piece opposing Lucius on the gameboard. For266 *you to do such a thing would strengthen him greatly, and I did not thinkthat was your chosen side.”The boy was still for a long moment.“This conversation grows private,” Harry said. His hand flicked inSeverus’s direction. “Send him away.”Dumbledore shook his head. “Harry, did I not tell you that SeverusSnape has my fullest confidence?”The boy’s face showed the shock of it. “This man’s bullying makes youvulnerable! I am not the only one who could start a newspaper campaignagainst you! This is insane! Why are you doing this?”Dumbledore sighed. “I’m sorry, Harry. It has to do with things thatyou are not, at this time, ready to hear.”The boy stared at Dumbledore. Then he turned to look at Severus.Then back to Dumbledore again.“It is insanity,” the boy said slowly. “You haven’t reined him in becauseyou think he’s part of the pattern. That Hogwarts needs an evil Potions Master to be a proper magical school, just as it needs a ghost to teach History.”“That does sound like the sort of thing I would do, doesn’t it?” saidDumbledore, smiling.“Unacceptable,” Harry said flatly. His gaze was now cold and dark. “Iwill not tolerate bullying or abuse. I had considered many possible waysof dealing with this problem, but I will make it simple. Either this mangoes, or I do.”Minerva gasped again. Something strange flickered in Severus’s eyes.Now Dumbledore’s gaze was also growing cold. “Expulsion, Mr. Potter, is the final threat which may be used against a student. It is not customarily used as a threat by students against the Headmaster. This is thebest magical school in the entire world, and an education here is not anopportunity given to everyone. Are you under the impression that Hogwarts cannot get along without you?”And Harry sat there, smiling thinly.Sudden horror dawned on Minerva. Surely Harry wouldn’t—“You forget,” Harry said, “that you’re not the only one who can see patterns. This grows private. Now send him—” Harry flicked a hand at Severusagain, and then stopped in mid-sentence and mid-gesture.267 *Minerva could see it on Harry’s face, the moment when he remembered.She’d told him, after all.“Mr. Potter,” said the Headmaster, “once again, Severus Snape has myfullest confidence.”“You told him,” whispered the boy. “You utter fool.”Dumbledore didn’t react to the insult. “Told him what?”“That the Dark Lord is alive.”“What in Merlin’s name are you on about, Potter?” cried Severus in tonesof sheer astonishment and outrage.Harry glanced briefly at him, smiling grimly. “Oh, so we are aSlytherin, then,” Harry said. “I was starting to wonder.”And then there was silence.Finally Dumbledore spoke. His voice was mild. “Harry, what are youtalking about?”“I’m sorry, Albus,” Minerva whispered.Severus and Dumbledore turned to look at her.“Professor McGonagall didn’t tell me,” said Harry’s voice, swiftly andless calm than it had been. “I guessed. I told you, I can see the patternstoo. I guessed, and she controlled her reaction just as Severus did. Buther control fell a shade short of perfection, and I could tell it was control,not genuine.”“And I told him,” said Minerva, her voice trembling a little, “that you,and I, and Severus were the only ones who knew.”“Which she did as a concession to prevent me from simply goingaround asking questions, as I threatened to do if she didn’t talk,” Harrysaid. The boy chuckled briefly. “I really should have gotten one of youalone and told you that she told me everything, to see if you let anythingslip. Probably wouldn’t have worked, but would have been worth a shot.”The boy smiled again. “Threat’s still on the table and I do expect to bebriefed fully at some point.”Severus was giving her a look of utter contempt. Minerva raised herchin and bore it. She knew it was deserved.Dumbledore leaned back in his padded throne. His eyes were as coldas anything Minerva had seen from him since the day his brother died.268 *“And you threaten to abandon us to Voldemort if we do not comply withyour wishes.”Harry’s voice was razor-sharp. “I regret to inform you that you arenot the center of the universe. I’m not threatening to walk out on magicalBritain. I’m threatening to walk out on you. I am not a meek little Frodo.This is my quest and if you want in you will play by my rules.”Dumbledore’s face was still cold. “I am beginning to doubt your suitability as the hero, Mr. Potter.”Harry’s return gaze was equally icy. “I am beginning to doubt yoursuitability as my Gandalf, Mr. Dumbledore. Boromir was at least a plausible mistake. What is this Nazgul doing in my Fellowship?”Minerva was completely lost. She looked at Severus, to see if he wasfollowing this, and she saw that Severus had turned his face away fromHarry’s field of vision and was smiling.“I suppose,” Dumbledore said slowly, “that from your perspective it isa reasonable question. So, Mr. Potter, if Professor Snape is to leave youalone henceforth, will that be the last time this issue arises, or will I findyou here every week with a new demand?”“Leave me alone?” Harry’s voice was outraged. “I am not his only victim and certainly not the most vulnerable! Have you forgotten how defenseless children are? How much they hurt? Henceforth Severus will treat everystudent of Hogwarts with appropriate and professional courtesy, or youwill find another Potions Master, or you will find another hero!”Dumbledore started laughing. Full-throated, warm, humorous laughter, as if Harry had just performed a comic dance in front of him.Minerva didn’t dare move. Her eyes flickered and she saw thatSeverus was equally motionless.Harry’s visage grew even colder. “You mistake me, Headmaster, if youthink that this is a joke. This is not a request. This is your punishment.”“Mr. Potter—” Minerva said. She didn’t even know what she was going to say. She simply couldn’t let that go by.Harry made a shushing gesture at her and continued to speak to Dumbledore. “And if that seems impolite to you,” Harry said, his voice now alittle less hard, “it seemed no less impolite when you said it to me. Youwould not say such a thing to anyone who you considered a real human269 *being instead of a subordinate child, and I will treat you with just thesame courtesy as you treat me—”“Oh, indeed, in very deed, this is my punishment if ever there was one!Of course you’re in here blackmailing me to save your fellow students, notto save yourself! I can’t imagine why I would have thought otherwise!”Dumbledore was now laughing even harder. He pounded his fist on thedesk three times.Harry’s gaze grew uncertain. His face turned toward her, addressingher for the first time. “Excuse me,” Harry said. His voice seemed to bewavering. “Does he need to take his medication or something?”“Ah…” Minerva had no idea what she could possibly say.“Well,” said Dumbledore. He wiped away tears that had formed in hiseyes. “Pardon me. I’m sorry for the interruption. Please continue withthe blackmail.”Harry opened his mouth, then closed it again. He now seemed a littleunsteady. “Ah… he’s also to stop reading students’ minds.”“Minerva,” Severus said, his voice deadly, “you—”“Sorting Hat warned me,” said Harry.“What?”“Can’t say anything else. Anyway I think that’s it. I’m done.”Silence.“Now what?” Minerva said, when it became apparent that no one elsewas going to say anything.“Now what?” Dumbledore echoed. “Why, now the hero wins, ofcourse.”“What?” said Severus, Minerva, and Harry.“Well, he certainly seems to have backed us into a corner,” Dumbledore said, smiling happily. “But Hogwarts does need an evil Potions Master, or it just wouldn’t be a proper magical school, now would it? So howabout if Professor Snape is only awful toward students in their fifth yearand higher?”“What?” said all three of them again.“If it’s the most vulnerable victims about whom you’re concerned.Maybe you’re right, Harry. Maybe I have forgotten over the decadeswhat it’s like to be a child. So let’s compromise. Severus will continue270 *to unfairly award points to Slytherin and impose lax discipline on hisHouse, and he will be awful to non-Slytherin students in their fifth yearand higher. To others he will be scary, but not abusive. He will promiseto only read minds when the safety of a student requires it. Hogwartswill have its evil Potions Master, and the most vulnerable victims, as youput it, will be safe.”Minerva McGonagall was as shocked as she’d ever been in her life. Sheglanced uncertainly at Severus, whose face had been left completely neutral, as though he couldn’t decide what sort of expression he ought to bewearing.“I suppose that is acceptable,” Harry said. His voice sounded a bit odd.“You can’t be serious,” Severus said, his voice as expressionless as hisface.“I am very much in favor of this,” Minerva said slowly. She was somuch in favor that her heart was pounding wildly beneath her robes. “Butwhat could we possibly tell the students? They might not have questionedthis while Severus was… being awful to everyone, but—”“Harry can tell the other students that he discovered a terrible secretof Severus’s and did a bit of blackmail,” said Dumbledore. “It’s true, afterall; he discovered that Severus was reading minds, and he certainly didblackmail us.”“This is insanity!” exploded Severus.“Bwah ha ha!” said Dumbledore.“Ah…” said Harry uncertainly. “And if anyone asks me why fifth yearsand above got shafted? I wouldn’t blame them for being irate, and thatpart wasn’t exactly my idea—”“Tell them,” said Dumbledore, “that it wasn’t you who suggested thecompromise, that it was all you could get. And then refuse to say anythingmore. That, too, is true. There’s an art to it, you’ll pick it up with practice.”Harry nodded slowly. “And the points he took from Ravenclaw?”“They must not be given back.”It was Minerva who said it.Harry looked at her.“I’m sorry, Mr. Potter,” she said. She was sorry, but it had to be done.“There must be some consequences for your misbehavior or this schoolwill fall to pieces.”Harry shrugged. “Acceptable,” he said flatly. “But in the futureSeverus will not strike at my House connections by taking points fromme, nor will he waste my valuable time with detentions. Should he feelthat my behavior requires correction, he may communicate his concernsto Professor McGonagall.”“Harry,” Minerva said, “will you continue to submit to school discipline, or are you to be above the law now, as Severus was?”Harry looked at her. Something warm touched his gaze, briefly beforeit was quashed. “I will continue to be an ordinary student to every member of the staff who is not insane or evil, provided that they do not comeunder pressure from others who are.” Harry glanced briefly at Severus,then turned back to Dumbledore. “Leave Minerva alone, and I’ll be a regular Hogwarts student in her presence. No special privileges or immunities.”“Beautiful,” Dumbledore said sincerely. “Spoken like a true hero.”“And,” she said, “Mr. Potter must publicly apologize for his actions oftoday.”Harry gave her another look. This one was a bit skeptical.“The discipline of the school has been gravely injured by your actions,Mr. Potter,” Minerva said. “It must be restored.”“I think, Professor McGonagall, that you considerably overestimatethe importance of what you call school discipline, as compared to havingHistory taught by a live teacher or not torturing your students. Maintaining the current status hierarchy and enforcing its rules seems everso much more wise and moral and important when you are on the topand doing the enforcing than when you are on the bottom, and I can citestudies to this effect if required. I could go on for several hours about thispoint, but I will leave it at that.”Minerva shook her head. “Mr. Potter, you underestimate the importance of discipline because you are not in need of it yourself—” Shepaused. That hadn’t come out right, and Severus, Dumbledore, and evenHarry were giving her strange looks. “To learn, I mean. Not every childcan learn in the absence of authority. And it is the other children whowill be hurt, Mr. Potter, if they see your example as one to be followed.”272 *Harry’s lips curved into a twisted smile. “The first and last resort isthe truth. The truth is that I shouldn’t have gotten angry, I shouldn’t havedisrupted the class, I shouldn’t have done what I did, and I set a bad example for everyone. The truth is also that Severus Snape behaved in afashion unbecoming a Hogwarts professor, and that from now on he willbe more mindful of the injured feelings of students in their fourth yearand under. The two of us could both get up and speak the truth. I couldlive with that.”“In your dreams, Potter!” spat Severus.“After all,” said Harry, smiling grimly, “if the students see that rulesare for everyone… for professors too, not just for poor helpless studentswho get nothing but suffering out of the system… why, the positive effectson school discipline should be tremendous.”There was a brief pause, and then Dumbledore chuckled. “Minerva isthinking that you’re righter than you have any right to be.”Harry’s gaze jerked away from Dumbledore, down to the floor. “Areyou reading her mind?”“Common sense is often mistaken for Legilimency,” said Dumbledore. “I shall talk over this matter with Severus, and no apology willbe required from you unless he apologizes as well. And now I declarethis matter concluded, at least until lunchtime.” He paused. “Although,Harry, I’m afraid that Minerva wished to speak with you about an additional matter. And that is not the result of any pressure on my part.Minerva, if you would?”Minerva rose from her chair and almost fell. There was too muchadrenaline in her blood, her heart was beating too fast.“Fawkes,” said Dumbledore, “accompany her, please.”“I don’t—” she started to say.Dumbledore shot her a look, and she fell silent.The phoenix soared across the room like a smooth tongue of flameleaping out, and landed on her shoulder. She felt the warmth throughher robes, all through her body.“Please follow me, Mr. Potter,” she said, firmly now, and they leftthrough the door.273 *They stood on the rotating stairs, descending in silence.Minerva didn’t know what to say. She didn’t know this person whostood beside her.And Fawkes began to croon.It was tender, and soft, like a fireplace would sound if it had melody,and it washed over Minerva’s mind, easing, soothing, gentling what ittouched…“What is that?” Harry whispered beside her. His voice was unstable,wobbling, changing pitch.“The song of the phoenix,” said Minerva, not really aware of what shewas saying, her attention was all on that strange quiet music. “It, too,heals.”Harry turned his face from her, but she caught a glimpse of something agonized.The descent seemed to take a very long time, or maybe it was onlythat the music seemed to take a very long time, and when they steppedout through the gap where a gargoyle had been, she was holding Harry’shand firmly in hers.As the gargoyle stepped back into place, Fawkes left her shoulder, andswooped to hover in front of Harry.Harry stared at Fawkes like someone hypnotized by the everchanging light of a fire.“What am I to do, Fawkes?” whispered Harry. “I couldn’t have protected them if I hadn’t been angry.”The phoenix’s wings continued flapping, it continued hovering inplace. There was no sound but the beating of the wings. Then there wasa flash like a fire flaring up and going out, and Fawkes was gone.Both of them blinked, like waking up from a dream, or maybe likefalling asleep again.Minerva looked down.Harry Potter’s bright young face looked up at her.“Are phoenixes people?” said Harry. “I mean, are they smart enoughto count as people? Could I talk with Fawkes if I knew how?”274 *Minerva blinked hard. Then she blinked again. “No,” Minerva said,her voice wavering. “Phoenixes are creatures of powerful magic. Thatmagic gives their existence a weight of meaning which no simple animalcould possess. They are fire, light, healing, rebirth. But in the end, no.”“Where can I get one?”Minerva leaned down and hugged him. She hadn’t meant to, but shedidn’t seem to have much choice in the matter.When she stood up she found it hard to speak. But she had to ask.“What happened today, Harry?”“I don’t know the answers to any of the important questions either.Aside from that I’d really rather not think about it for a while.”Minerva took his hand in hers again, and they walked the rest of theway in silence.It was only a short trip, since naturally the office of the Deputy wasclose to the office of the Headmaster.Minerva sat behind her desk.Harry sat in front of her desk.“So,” Minerva whispered. She would have given almost anything notto do this, or not to be the one who had to do it, or for it to be any timebut right now. “There is a matter of school discipline. From which youare not exempt.”“Namely?” said Harry.He didn’t know. He hadn’t figured it out yet. She felt her throattighten. But there was work to be done and she would not shirk it.“Mr. Potter,” said Professor McGonagall, “I need to see your TimeTurner, please.”All the peace of the phoenix vanished from his face in an instant andMinerva felt like she had just stabbed him.“No!” Harry said. His voice was panicked. “I need it, I won’t be able toattend Hogwarts, I won’t be able to sleep!”“You’ll be able to sleep,” she said. “The Ministry has delivered the protective shell for your Time-Turner. I will enchant it to open only betweenthe hours of 9pm and midnight.”Harry’s face twisted. “But—but I—”275 *“Mr. Potter, how many times have you used the Time-Turner sinceMonday? How many hours?”“I…” Harry said. “Hold on, let me add it up—” He glanced down at hiswatch.Minerva felt a rush of sadness. She’d thought so. “It wasn’t just twoper day, then. I suspect that if I asked your dormmates, I would find thatyou were struggling to stay up long enough to go to sleep at a reasonabletime, and waking up earlier and earlier every morning. Correct?”Harry’s face said everything she needed to know.“Mr. Potter,” she said gently, “there are students who cannot be entrusted with Time-Turners, because they become addicted to them. Wegive them a potion which lengthens their sleep cycle by the necessaryamount, but they end up using the Time-Turner for more than just attending their classes. And so we must take them back. Mr. Potter, youhave taken to using the Time-Turner as your solution to everything, often very foolishly so. You used it to get back a Remembrall. You vanishedfrom a closet in a fashion apparent to other students, instead of goingback after you were out and getting me or someone else to come and openthe door.”From the look on Harry’s face he hadn’t thought of that.“And more importantly,” she said, “you should have simply sat in Professor Snape’s class. And watched. And left at the end of class. As youwould have done if you had not possessed a Time-Turner. There are somestudents who cannot be entrusted with Time-Turners, Mr. Potter. Youare one of them. I am sorry.”“But I need it!” Harry blurted. “What if there are Slytherins threatening me and I have to escape? It keeps me safe—”“Every other student in this castle runs the same risk, and I assureyou that they survive. No student has died in this castle for fifty years.Mr. Potter, you will hand over your Time-Turner and do so now.”Harry’s face twisted in agony, but he drew out the Time-Turner fromunder his robes and gave it to her.From her desk, Minerva drew out one of the protective shells thathad been sent to Hogwarts. She snapped the cover into place around the276 *Time-Turner’s turning hourglass, and then she laid her wand on the coverto complete the enchantment.“This isn’t fair!” Harry shrieked. “I saved half of Hogwarts from Professor Snape today, is it right that I be punished for it? I saw the look onyour face, you hated what he was doing!”Minerva didn’t speak for a few moments. She was enchanting.When she finished and looked up, she knew that her face was stern.Maybe it was the wrong thing to do. And then again maybe it was theright thing to do. There was an obstinate child in front of her, and thatdidn’t mean the universe was broken.“Fair, Mr. Potter?” she snapped. “I have had to file two reports withthe Ministry on public use of a Time-Turner in two successive days! Be extremely grateful you were allowed to retain the Time-Turner even in restricted form! The Headmaster made a Floo call to plead with them personally and if you were not the Boy-Who-Lived even that would not havesufficed!”Harry gaped at her.She knew that he was seeing the angry face of Professor McGonagall.Harry’s eyes filled up with tears.“I’m, sorry,” he whispered, voice now choked and broken. “I’m sorry,to have, disappointed you…”“I’m sorry too, Mr. Potter,” she said sternly, and handed him the newlyrestricted Time-Turner. “You may go.”Harry turned and fled from her office, sobbing. She heard his feet pattering away down the hall, and then the sound cut off as the door swungclosed.“I’m sorry too, Harry,” she whispered to the quiet room. “I’m sorrytoo.”Fifteen minutes into lunch hour.277 *No one was speaking to Harry. Some of the Ravenclaws were shooting him looks of anger, others of sympathy, a few of the youngest students even had looks of admiration, but no one was talking to him. EvenHermione hadn’t tried to come over.Fred and George had gingerly stepped near. They hadn’t said anything. The offer was clear, and its optionality. Harry had told them thathe would come over when dessert started, no earlier. They had noddedand quickly walked away.It was probably the utterly expressionless look on Harry’s face thatwas doing it.The others probably thought he was controlling anger, or dismay.They knew, because they’d seen Flitwick come and get him, that he’dbeen called to the Headmaster’s office.Harry was trying not to smile, because if he smiled, he would startlaughing, and if he started laughing, he wouldn’t stop until the nice people in white jackets came to haul him away.It was too much. It was just all too much. Harry had almost gone overto the Dark Side, his dark side had done things that seemed in retrospectinsane, his dark side had won an impossible victory that might have beenreal and might have been a pure whim of a crazy Headmaster, his darkside had protected his friends. He just couldn’t handle it any more. Heneeded Fawkes to sing to him again. He needed to use the Time-Turnerto go off and take a quiet hour to recover but that wasn’t an option anymore and the loss was like a hole in his existence but he couldn’t thinkabout that because then he might start laughing.Twenty minutes. All the students who were going to eat lunch hadarrived, almost none had departed.The tapping of a spoon rang through the Great Hall.“If I may have your attention please,” Dumbledore said. “Harry Potterhas something he would like to share with us.”Harry took a deep breath and got up. He walked over to the HeadTable, with every eye staring at him.Harry turned and looked out at the four tables.It was becoming harder and harder not to smile, but Harry kept hisface expressionless as he spoke his brief and memorized speech.278 *“The truth is sacred,” Harry said tonelessly. “One of my most treasured possessions is a button which reads ‘Speak the truth, even if yourvoice trembles’. This, then, is the truth. Remember that. I am not saying it because I am being forced to say it, I am saying it because it is true.What I did in Professor Snape’s class was foolish, stupid, childish, and aninexcusable violation of the rules of Hogwarts. I disrupted the classroomand deprived my fellow students of their irreplaceable learning time. Allbecause I failed to control my temper. I hope that not a single one of youwill ever follow my example. I certainly intend to try never to follow itagain.”Many of the students gazing at Harry now had solemn, unhappy looksupon their faces, such as one might see at a ceremony marking the loss ofa fallen champion. At the younger parts of the Gryffindor table the lookwas almost universal.Until Harry raised his hand.He did not raise it high. That might have appeared preemptory. Hecertainly did not raise it toward Severus. Harry simply raised his hand tochest level, and softly snapped his fingers, a gesture that was seen morethan heard. It was possible that most of the Head Table wouldn’t see it atall.This seeming gesture of defiance won sudden smiles from theyounger students and Gryffindors, and coldly superior sneers fromSlytherin, and frowns and worried looks from all others.Harry kept his face expressionless. “Thank you,” he said. “That’s all.”“Thank you, Mr. Potter,” said the Headmaster. “And now ProfessorSnape has something to share with us as well.”Severus smoothly stood up from his place at the Head Table. “It hasbeen brought to my attention,” he said, “that my own actions played apart in provoking the admittedly inexcusable anger of Mr. Potter, and inthe ensuing discussion I realized that I had forgotten how easily injuredare the feelings of the young and immature—”There was the sound of many people emitting muffled chokes at thesame time.Severus continued as if he had not heard. “The Potions classroom isa dangerous place, and I still feel that strict discipline is necessary, but279 *henceforth I will be more aware of the… emotional fragility… of studentsin their fourth year and younger. My deduction of points from Ravenclawstill stands, but I will revoke Mr. Potter’s detention. Thank you.”There was a single clap from the direction of Gryffindor and fasterthan lightning Severus’s wand was in his hand and “Quietus!” silencedthe offender.“I will still demand discipline and respect in all my classes,” Severussaid coldly, “and anyone who trifles with me will regret it.”He sat down.“Thank you too!” Headmaster Dumbledore said cheerfully. “Carryon!”And Harry, still expressionless, began to walk back to his seat inRavenclaw.There was an explosion of conversation. Two words were clearly identifiable in the beginning. The first was an initial “What—” beginningmany different sentences such as “What just happened—” and “What thehell—” The second was “Scourgify!” as students cleaned up the droppedfood and spit-out drinks from themselves, the tablecloth, and each other.Some students were weeping openly. So was Professor Sprout.At the Gryffindor table, where a cake waited with fifty-one unlit candles, Fred whispered, “I think we may be out of our league here, George.”And from that day onward, no matter what Hermione tried to tell anyone, it would be an accepted legend of Hogwarts that Harry Potter couldmake absolutely anything happen by snapping his fingers.280 *raco had a stern expression on his face, and his green-trimmedrobes somehow looked far more formal, serious, and well-turnedout than the same exact robes as worn by the two boys behind him.“Talk,” said Draco.“Yeah! Talk!”“You heard da boss! Talk!”“You two, on the other hand, shut up.”The last session of classes on Friday was about to start, in that vastauditorium where all four Houses learned Defense, er, Battle Magic.The last session of classes on Friday.Harry was hoping that this class would be non-stressful, and that thebrilliant Professor Quirrell would realize this was perhaps not the besttime to single out Harry for anything. Harry had recovered a little, but……but just in case, it was probably best to get in a bit of stress relieffirst.Harry leaned back in his chair and bestowed a look of great solemnityupon Draco and his minions.“You ask, what is our aim?” Harry declaimed. “I can answer in oneword. It is victory. Victory at all costs—Victory in spite of all terrors—Victory, however long and hard the road may be, for without victory thereis no—”“Talk about Snape,” Draco hissed. “What did you do?”Harry wiped away the fake solemnity and gave Draco a more seriouslook.“You saw it,” Harry said. “Everyone saw it. I snapped my fingers.”“Harry! Stop teasing me!”So he’d been promoted to Harry now. Interesting. And in fact Harrywas fairly sure that he was meant to notice that, and feel bad if he didn’trespond somehow…Harry tapped his ears and gave a significant glance at the minions.“They won’t talk,” said Draco.“Draco,” Harry said, “I’m going to be one hundred percent honest hereand say that yesterday I was not particularly impressed with Mr. Goyle’scunning.”Mr. Goyle winced.“Me neither,” said Draco. “I explained to him that I ended up owingyou a favor because of it.” (Mr. Goyle winced again.) “But there is a bigdifference between that sort of mistake and being indiscreet. That reallyis something they’ve been trained from childhood to understand.”“All right then,” Harry said. He lowered his voice, even though thebackground noises had gone to blurs in Draco’s presence. “I deduced oneof Severus’s secrets and did a bit of blackmail.”Draco’s expression hardened. “Good, now tell me something youdidn’t tell in strict confidence to the idiots in Gryffindor, meaning thatwas the story you wanted to get all over the school.”Harry grinned involuntarily and he knew that Draco had caught it.“What is Severus saying?” Harry said.“That he hadn’t realized how sensitive the feelings of young childrenwere,” Draco said. “Even in Slytherin! Even to me!”“Are you sure,” Harry said, “that you want to know something yourHead of House would rather you not know?”“Yes,” Draco said without hesitation.Interesting. “Then you really are going to send your minions away first,because I’m not sure I can believe everything you believe about them.”Draco nodded. “Okay.”Mr. Crabbe and Mr. Goyle looked very unhappy. “Boss—” saidMr. Crabbe.“You’ve given Mr. Potter no reason to trust you,” Draco said. “Go!”They left.“In particular,” Harry said, lowering his voice even further, “I’m notentirely sure that they wouldn’t just report what I said to Lucius.”282 *“Father wouldn’t do that!” Draco said, looking genuinely aghast.“They’re mine!”“I’m sorry, Draco,” Harry said. “I’m just not sure I can believe everything you believe about your father. Imagine it was your secret and metelling you my father wouldn’t do that.”Draco nodded slowly. “You’re right. I’m sorry, Harry. It was wrong ofme to ask it of you.”How did I get this promoted? Shouldn’t he hate me now? Harry had thefeeling he was looking at something exploitable… he just wished his brainwasn’t so exhausted. Ordinarily he would have loved to try his hand atsome complicated plotting.“Anyway,” Harry said. “Trade. I tell you a fact that isn’t on thegrapevine, and does not go on the grapevine, and in particular does notgo to your father, and in return you tell me what you and Slytherin thinkabout the whole business.”“Deal!”Now to make this as vague as possible… something that wouldn’t hurtmuch even if it did get out… “What I said was true. I did discover one ofSeverus’s secrets, and I did do some blackmail. But Severus wasn’t theonly person involved.”“I knew it!” Draco said exultantly.Harry’s stomach sank. He had apparently said something very significant and he did not know why. This was not a good sign.“All right,” Draco said. He was grinning widely now. “So here’s whatthe reaction was like in Slytherin. First, all the idiots were like, ‘We hateHarry Potter! Let’s go beat him up!’”Harry choked. “What is wrong with the Sorting Hat? That’s notSlytherin, it’s Gryffindor—”“Not all children are prodigies,” Draco said, though he was smilingin a sort of nasty-conspiratorial way, as though to suggest that he privately agreed with Harry’s opinion. “And it took around fifteen secondsfor someone to explain to them why this might not be such a favor toSnape, so you’re fine. Anyway, after that was the second wave of idiots,the ones who were saying, ‘Looks like Harry Potter was just another dogooder after all.’”283 *“And then?” Harry said, smiling even though he had no idea why thatwas stupid.“And then the actual smart people started talking. It’s obvious thatyou found a way to put a lot of pressure on Snape. And while that couldbe more than one thing… the obvious next thought is that it has somethingto do with Snape’s unknown hold over Dumbledore. Am I right?”“No comment,” Harry said. At least his brain was processing this partcorrectly. House Slytherin had wondered why Severus wasn’t gettingfired. And they’d concluded that Severus was blackmailing Dumbledore.Could that actually be true…? But Dumbledore hadn’t seemed to act likeit…Draco went on talking. “And the next thing the smart people pointedout was that if you could put enough pressure on Snape to make him leavehalf of Hogwarts alone, that meant you probably had enough power to getrid of him entirely, if you wanted. What you did to him was a humiliation,just the same way he tried to humiliate you—but you left us our Head ofHouse.”Harry made his smile wider.“And then the really smart people,” Draco said, his face now serious,“went off and had a little discussion by themselves, and someone pointedout that it would be a very stupid thing to leave an enemy around like that.If you could break his hold over Dumbledore, the obvious thing would beto just do it. Dumbledore would kick Snape out of Hogwarts and maybeeven have him killed, he’d be very grateful to you, and you wouldn’t haveto worry about Snape sneaking into your dorm room at night with interesting potions.”Harry’s face was now neutral. He had not thought of that and he really, really should have. “And from this you concluded…?”“Snape’s hold was some secret of Dumbledore’s and you’ve got the secret!” Draco was looking exultant. “It can’t be powerful enough to destroyDumbledore entirely, or Snape would have used it by now. Snape refusesto use his hold for anything except staying king of Slytherin House inHogwarts, and he doesn’t always get what he wants even then, so it musthave limits. But it’s got to be really good! Father’s been trying to get Snapeto tell him for years!”284 *“And,” Harry said, “now Lucius thinks maybe I can tell him. Did youalready get an owl—”“I will tonight,” Draco said, and laughed. “It will say,” his voice tookon a different, more formal cadence, “My beloved son: I’ve already told youof Harry Potter’s potential importance. As you have already realized, his importance has now become greater and more urgent. If you see any possible avenue offriendship or point of pressure with him, you must pursue it, and the full resourcesof Malfoy are at your disposal if needed.”Gosh. “Well,” Harry said, “not commenting on whether or not yourwhole complicated edifice of theory is true, let me just say that we are notquite such good friends as yet.”“I know,” Draco said. Then his face turned very serious, and his voicegrew quiet even within the blur. “Harry, has it occurred to you that if youknow something Dumbledore doesn’t want known, Dumbledore mightsimply have you killed? And it would turn the Boy-Who-Lived from a potential competing leader into a valuable martyr, too.”“No comment,” Harry said yet again. He hadn’t thought of that lastpart, either. Didn’t seem to be Dumbledore’s style… but…“Harry,” Draco said, “you’ve obviously got incredible talent, but you’vegot no training and no mentors and you do stupid things sometimes andyou really need an advisor who knows how to do this or you’re going to get hurt!”Draco’s face was fierce.“Ah,” Harry said. “An advisor like Lucius?”“Like me!” said Draco. “I’ll promise to keep your secrets from Father,from everyone, I’ll just help you figure out whatever you want to do!”Wow.Harry saw that zombie-Quirrell was staggering in through the doors.“Class is about to start,” said Harry. “I’ll think about what you said,there’s lots of times I do wish I had all your training, it’s just I don’t knowhow I can trust you so quickly—”“You shouldn’t,” Draco said, “it’s too soon. See? I’ll give you good advice even if it hurts me. But we should maybe hurry up and become closerfriends.”“I’m open to that,” said Harry, who was already trying to figure outhow to exploit it.285 *“Another bit of advice,” Draco said hurriedly as Quirrell slouched toward his desk, “right now everyone in Slytherin’s wondering about you,so if you’re courting us, which I think you are, you should do somethingthat signals friendship to Slytherin. Soon, like today or tomorrow.”“Letting Severus go on awarding extra House points to Slytherinwasn’t enough?” No reason Harry couldn’t take credit for it.Draco’s eyes flickered with realization, then he said rapidly, “It’s notthe same, trust me, it’s got to be something obvious. Push your mudbloodrival Granger into a wall or something, everyone in Slytherin will knowwhat that means—”“That is not how it works in Ravenclaw, Draco! If you have to pushsomeone into a wall it means your brain is too weak to beat them the rightway and everyone in Ravenclaw knows that—”The screen on Harry’s desk flickered on, provoking a sudden wash ofnostalgia for television and computers.“Ahem,” said Professor Quirrell’s voice, seeming to speak personallyto Harry out of the screen. “Please take your seats.”And the children were all seated and staring at the repeater screens ontheir desks, or looking down directly at the great white marble stagewhere Professor Quirrell stood, leaning on his desk atop the small daisof darker marble.“Today,” said Professor Quirrell, “I had planned to teach you your firstdefensive spell, a small shield that was the ancestor of today’s Protego. Buton second thought I have changed today’s lesson plan in the light of recent events.”Professor Quirrell’s gaze searched the rows of seats. Harry wincedfrom where he was sitting, in the back row. He had a feeling he knewwho was about to be called on.“Draco, of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy,” said Professor Quirrell.Whew.286 *“Yes, Professor?” said Draco. His voice was amplified, seeming tocome from the repeater screen on Harry’s desk, which showed Draco’sface as he spoke. Then the screen shifted back to Professor Quirrell, whosaid:“Is it your ambition to become the next Dark Lord?”“That’s an odd question, Professor,” said Draco. “I mean, who’d bedumb enough to admit it?”A few students laughed, but not many.“Indeed,” said Professor Quirrell. “So while there’s no point in askingany of you, it would not surprise me in the slightest if there were a studentor two in my classes who harbored ambitions of being the next Dark Lord.After all, I wanted to be the next Dark Lord when I was a young Slytherin.”This time the laughter was much more widespread.“Well, it is the House of the ambitious, after all,” Professor Quirrellsaid, smiling. “I didn’t realize until later that what I really enjoyed wasBattle Magic, and that my true ambition was to become a great fightingwizard and someday teach at Hogwarts. In any case, when I was thirteenyears old, I read through the historical sections of the Hogwarts library,scrutinizing the lives and fates of past Dark Lords, and I made a list of allthe mistakes that I would never make when I was a Dark Lord—”Harry giggled before he could stop himself.“Yes, Mr. Potter, very amusing. So, Mr. Potter, can you guess whatwas the very first item on that list?”Great. “Um… never use a complicated way of dealing with an enemywhen you can just Abracadabra them?”“The term, Mr. Potter, is Avada Kedavra,” Professor Quirrell’s voicesounded a bit sharp for some reason, “and no, that was not on the list Imade at age thirteen. Would you care to guess again?”“Ah… never brag to anyone about your evil master plan?”Professor Quirrell laughed. “Ah, now that was number two. My,Mr. Potter, have we been reading the same books?”There was more laughter, with an undertone of nervousness. Harryclenched his jaw tightly shut and said nothing. A denial would accomplish nothing.287 *“But no. The first item was, ‘I will not go around provoking strong,vicious enemies.’ The history of the world would be very different if Mornelithe Falconsbane or Hitler had grasped that elementary point. Now if,Mr. Potter—just if by some chance you harbor an ambition similar to theone I held as a young Slytherin—even so, I hope it is not your ambitionto become a stupid Dark Lord.”“Professor Quirrell,” Harry said, gritting his teeth, “I am a Ravenclawand it is not my ambition to be stupid, period. I know that what I didtoday was dumb. But it wasn’t Dark! I was not the one who threw the firstpunch in that fight!”“You, Mr. Potter, are an idiot. But then so was I at your age. ThusI anticipated your answer and altered today’s lesson plan accordingly.Mr. Gregory Goyle, if you would come forward, please?”There was a surprised pause in the classroom. Harry hadn’t been expecting that.Neither, from the looks of it, had Mr. Goyle, who looked rather uncertain and worried as he mounted the marble stage and approached thedais.Professor Quirrell straightened from where he was leaning on thedesk. He looked suddenly stronger, and his hands formed fists and hedrew himself up into a clearly recognizable martial arts stance.Harry’s eyes widened at the sight, and he realized why Mr. Goyle hadbeen called up.“Most wizards,” Professor Quirrell said, “do not bother much withwhat a Muggle would term martial arts. Is not a wand stronger than afist? This attitude is stupid. Wands are held in fists. If you want to be agreat fighting wizard you must learn martial arts to a level which wouldimpress even a Muggle. I will now demonstrate a certain vitally important technique, which I learned in a dojo, a Muggle school of martial arts,of which I shall speak more shortly. For now…” Professor Quirrell tookseveral steps forward, still in stance, advancing on where Mr. Goyle stood.“Mr. Goyle, I will ask you to attack me.”“Professor Quirrell,” said Mr. Goyle, his voice now amplified as theprofessor’s was, “can I ask what level—”288 *“Sixth dan. You will not be hurt and neither will I. And if you see anopening, please take it.”Mr. Goyle nodded, looking much relieved.“Note,” Professor Quirrell said, “that Mr. Goyle was afraid to attacksomeone who did not know martial arts to an acceptable level, for fearthat I, or he, would be hurt. Mr. Goyle’s attitude is exactly correct and hehas earned three Quirrell points for it. Now, fight!”The young boy blurred forward, fists flying, and the Professor blockedevery blow, dancing backward, Quirrell kicked and Goyle blocked andspun and tried to trip Quirrell with a sweeping leg and Quirrell hoppedover it and it was all happening too fast for Harry to make sense of whatwas going on and then Goyle was on his back with his legs pushing andQuirrell was actually flying through the air and then he hit the ground shoulder first and rolled.“Stop!” cried Professor Quirrell from the ground, sounding a littlepanicked. “You win!”Mr. Goyle pulled up so sharply he staggered, almost tripping andfalling from the aborted momentum of his headlong charge towardProfessor Quirrell. His face showed utter shock.Professor Quirrell arched his back and bounced to his feet using a peculiar springing motion that made no use of his hands.There was a silence in the classroom, a silence born of total confusion.“Mr. Goyle,” said Professor Quirrell, “what vitally important technique did I demonstrate?”“How to fall correctly when someone throws you,” said Mr. Goyle. “It’sone of the very first lessons you learn—”“That too,” said Professor Quirrell.There was a pause.“The vitally important technique which I demonstrated,” said Professor Quirrell, “was how to lose. You may go, Mr. Goyle, thank you.”Mr. Goyle walked off the platform, looking rather bewildered. Harryfelt the same way.Professor Quirrell walked back to his desk and resumed leaning onit. “Sometimes we forget the most basic things, since it has been too longsince we learned them. I realized I had done the same with my own lesson289 *plan. You do not teach students to throw until you have taught them tofall. And I must not teach you to fight if you do not understand how tolose.”Professor Quirrell’s face hardened, and Harry thought he saw a hintof pain, a touch of sorrow, in those eyes. “I learned how to lose in a dojoin Asia, which, as any Muggle knows, is where all the good martial artistslive. This dojo taught a style which had a reputation among fighting wizards as adapting well to magical dueling. The Master of that dojo—an oldman by Muggle standards—was that style’s greatest living teacher. Hehad no idea that magic existed, of course. I applied to study there, andwas one of the few students accepted that year, from among many contenders. There might have been a tiny bit of special influence involved.”There was some laughter in the classroom. Harry didn’t share it. Thathadn’t been right at all.“In any case. During one of my first fights, after I had been beaten in aparticularly humiliating fashion, I lost control and attacked my sparringpartner—”Yikes.“—thankfully with my fists, rather than my magic. The Master, surprisingly, did not expel me on the spot. But he told me that there was aflaw in my temperament. He explained it to me, and I knew that he wasright. And then he said that I would learn how to lose.”Professor Quirrell’s face was expressionless.“Upon his strict orders, all of the students of the dojo lined up. One byone, they approached me. I was not to defend myself. I was only to begfor mercy. One by one, they slapped me, or punched me, and pushed meto the ground. Some of them spat on me. They called me awful namesin their language. And to each one, I had to say, ‘I lose!’ and similar suchthings, such as ‘I beg you to stop!’ and ‘I admit you’re better than me!’”Harry was trying to imagine this and simply failing. There was noway something like that could have happened to the dignified ProfessorQuirrell.“I was a prodigy of Battle Magic even then. With wandless magicalone I could have killed everyone in that dojo. I did not do so. I learnedto lose. To this day I remember it as one of the most unpleasant hours290 *of my life. And when I left that dojo eight months later—which was notnearly enough time, but was all I could afford to spend—the Master toldme that he hoped I understood why that had been necessary. And I toldhim that it was one of the most valuable lessons I had ever learned. Whichwas, and is, true.”Professor Quirrell’s face turned bitter. “You are wondering where thismarvelous dojo is, and whether you can study there. You cannot. For notlong afterward, another would-be student came to that hidden place, tothat remote mountain. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.”There was the sound of many breaths being drawn in simultaneously.Harry felt sick to his stomach. He knew what was coming.“The Dark Lord came to that school openly, without disguise, glowing red eyes and all. The students tried to bar his way and he simply Apparated through. There was terror there, but discipline, and the Mastercame forth. And the Dark Lord demanded—not asked, but demanded—to be taught.”Professor Quirrell’s face was very hard. “Perhaps the Master had readtoo many books telling the lie that a true martial artist could defeat evendemons. For whatever reason, the Master refused. The Dark Lord askedwhy he could not be a student. The Master told him he had no patience,and that was when the Dark Lord ripped his tongue out.”There was a collective gasp.“You can guess what happened next. The students tried to rush theDark Lord and fell over, stunned where they stood. And then…”Professor Quirrell’s voice faltered for a moment, then resumed.“There is an Unforgiveable Curse, the Cruciatus Curse, which produces unbearable pain. If the Cruciatus is extended for longer than a fewminutes it produces permanent insanity. One by one, the Dark Lord Crucioed the Master’s students into insanity, and then finished them off withthe Killing Curse, while the Master was forced to watch. When all his students had died in this way, the Master followed. I learned this from thesingle surviving student, whom the Dark Lord had left alive to tell the tale,and who had been a friend of mine…”Professor Quirrell turned away, and when he turned back a momentlater, he once again seemed calm and composed.“Dark Wizards cannot keep their tempers,” Professor Quirrell saidquietly. “It is a nearly universal flaw of the species, and anyone whomakes a habit of fighting them soon learns to rely on it. Understand thatthe Dark Lord did not win that day. His goal was to learn martial arts,and yet he left without a single lesson. The Dark Lord was foolish to wishthat story retold. It did not show his strength, but rather an exploitableweakness.”Professor Quirrell’s gaze focused on a single child in the classroom.“Harry Potter,” Professor Quirrell said.“Yes,” Harry said, his voice hoarse.“What precisely did you do wrong today, Mr. Potter?”Harry felt like he was going to throw up. “I lost my temper.”“That is not precise,” said Professor Quirrell. “I will describe it moreexactly. There are many animals which have what are called dominancecontests. They rush at each other with horns—trying to knock eachother down, not gore each other. They fight with their paws—with clawssheathed. But why with their claws sheathed? Surely, if they used theirclaws, they would stand a better chance of winning? But then theirenemy might unsheathe their claws as well, and instead of resolving thedominance contest with a winner and a loser, both of them might beseverely hurt.”Professor Quirrell gaze seemed to come straight out at Harry fromthe repeater screen. “What you demonstrated today, Mr. Potter, is that—unlike those animals who keep their claws sheathed and accept theresults—you do not know how to lose a dominance contest. When a Hogwarts professor challenged you, you did not back down. When it lookedlike you might lose, you unsheathed your claws, heedless of the danger.You escalated, and then you escalated again. It started with a slap at youfrom Professor Snape, who was obviously dominant over you. Instead oflosing, you slapped back and lost ten points from Ravenclaw. Soon youwere talking about leaving Hogwarts. The fact that you escalated evenfurther in some unknown direction, and somehow won at the end, doesnot change the fact that you are an idiot.”“I understand,” Harry said. His throat was dry. That had been precise. Frighteningly precise. Now that Professor Quirrell had said it, Harry292 *could see in hindsight that it was an exactly accurate description of whathad happened. When someone’s model of you was that good, you had towonder whether they were right about other things too, like your intentto kill.“The next time, Mr. Potter, that you choose to escalate a contest ratherthan lose, you may lose all the stakes you place on the table. I cannot guesswhat they were today. I can guess that they were far, far too high for theloss of ten House points.”Like the fate of magical Britain. That was what he’d done.“You will protest that you were trying to help all of Hogwarts, a muchmore important goal worthy of great risks. That is a lie. If you had been—”“I would have taken the slap, waited, and picked the best possible timeto make my move,” Harry said, his voice hoarse. “But that would havemeant losing. Letting him be dominant over me. It was what the DarkLord couldn’t do with the Master he wanted to learn from.”Professor Quirrell nodded. “I see that you have understood perfectly.And so, Mr. Potter, today you are going to learn how to lose.”“I will not hear any objections, Mr. Potter. It is evident both that youneed this and that you are strong enough to take it. I assure you that yourexperience will not be so harsh as what I went through, though you maywell remember it as the worst fifteen minutes of your young life.”Harry swallowed. “Professor Quirrell,” he said in a small voice, “canwe do this some other time?”“No,” Professor Quirrell said simply. “You are five days into your Hogwarts education and already this has happened. Today is Friday. Ournext defense class is on Wednesday. Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday… No, we do not have time to wait.”There were a few laughs at this, but very few.“Please consider it an order from your professor, Mr. Potter. WhatI would like to say is that otherwise I will not teach you any offensivespells, because I would then hear that you had severely hurt or even killedsomeone. Unfortunately I am told that your fingers are already powerfulweapons. Do not snap them at any time during this lesson.”More scattered laughter, sounding rather nervous.293 *Harry felt like he might cry. “Professor Quirrell, if you do anythinglike what you talked about, it’s going to make me angry, and I really wouldrather not get angry again today—”“The point is not to avoid getting angry,” Professor Quirrell said, hisface looking grave. “Anger is natural. You need to learn how to lose evenwhen you are angry. Or at least pretend to lose so that you can plan yourvengeance. As I did with Mr. Goyle today, unless of course any of youthink he really is better—”“I’m not!” shouted Mr. Goyle from his desk, sounding a little frantic.“I know you didn’t really lose! Please don’t plan any vengeances!”Harry felt sick to his stomach. Professor Quirrell didn’t know abouthis mysterious dark side. “Professor, we really need to talk about this after class—”“We will,” Professor Quirrell said in the tones of a promise. “After youlearn how to lose.” His face was serious. “It should go without saying thatI will exclude anything which could injure you or even cause you significant pain. The pain will come from the difficulty of losing, instead offighting back and escalating the battle until you win.”Harry’s breath was coming in short, panicky pants. He was morefrightened than he’d been after leaving the Potions classroom. “ProfessorQuirrell,” he managed to say, “I don’t want you to get fired over this—”“I will not be,” Professor Quirrell said, “if you tell them afterward thatit was necessary. And this I trust you to do.” For a moment ProfessorQuirrell’s voice turned very dry. “Believe me, they have tolerated worsein their hallways. This case will be exceptional only in that it happenswithin a classroom.”“Professor Quirrell,” Harry whispered, but he thought his voice wasstill being repeated everywhere, “do you really believe that if I don’t dothis, I might hurt someone?”“Yes,” Professor Quirrell said simply.“Then,” Harry felt nauseous, “I’ll do it.”Professor Quirrell turned to regard the Slytherins. “So… with the fullapproval of your teacher, and in such a fashion that Snape cannot beblamed for your actions… do any of you wish to show your dominance294 *over the Boy-Who-Lived? Shove him around, push him to the ground,hear him beg for your mercy?”Five hands went up.“Everyone with your hand raised, you are an absolute idiot. What partof pretending to lose did you not understand? If Harry Potter does becomethe next Dark Lord he will hunt you down and kill you after he graduates.”The five hands dropped abruptly back to their desks.“I won’t,” Harry said, his voice coming out rather weakly. “I swearnever to take vengeance upon those who help me learn to lose. ProfessorQuirrell… would you please… stop that?”Professor Quirrell sighed. “I am sorry, Mr. Potter. I realize that youmust find this equally annoying whether you intend to become a DarkLord or not. But those children also had an important life lesson to learn.Would it be acceptable if I awarded you a Quirrell point in apology?”“Make it two,” Harry said.There was a current of surprised laughter, defusing some of the tension.“Done,” Professor Quirrell said.“And after I graduate I’m going to hunt you down and tickle you.”There was more laughter, although Professor Quirrell didn’t smile.Harry felt like he was wrestling an anaconda, trying to force the conversation through the narrow course that would make people realize hewasn’t a Dark Lord after all… why was Professor Quirrell so suspicious ofhim?“Professor,” said Draco’s unamplified voice. “It is also not my ownambition to become a stupid Dark Lord.”There was a shocked silence in the classroom.You don’t have to do this! Harry almost blurted out loud, but checkedhimself in time; Draco might not wish it known that he was doing thisout of friendship for Harry… or out of the desire to appear friendly…Calling that a desire to appear friendly made Harry feel small, and mean.If Draco had intended to impress him, it was working perfectly.Professor Quirrell was regarding Draco gravely. “You worry thatyou cannot pretend to lose, Mr. Malfoy? That this flaw which describesMr. Potter also describes you? Surely your father taught you better.”295 *“When it comes to talking, maybe,” said Draco, now on the repeaterscreen. “Not when it comes to being shoved around and pushed to theground. I want to be fully as strong as you, Professor Quirrell.”Professor Quirrell’s eyebrows went up and stayed up. “I am afraid,Mr. Malfoy,” he said after a time, “that the arrangements I made forMr. Potter, involving some older Slytherins who will be told afterwardhow stupid they were, would not carry over onto you. But it is my professional opinion that you are already very strong. Should I hear thatyou have failed, as Mr. Potter failed today, I will make the appropriatearrangements and apologize to you and whomever you have hurt. I donot think this will be necessary, however.”“I understand, professor,” said Draco.Professor Quirrell looked over the class. “Does anyone else wish tobecome strong?”Some students glanced around nervously. Some, Harry thought fromhis back row, looked like they were opening their mouths but not sayinganything. In the end, no one spoke.“Draco Malfoy will be one of the generals of your year’s armies,” saidProfessor Quirrell, “should he deign to engage in that after-school activity. And now, Mr. Potter, please come forward.”Yes, Professor Quirrell had said, it must be in front of everyone, in front of yourfriends, because that is where Snape confronted you and that is where you mustlearn to lose.So now the first year watched. In magically enforced silence, and withrequests from both Harry and the professor not to intervene. Hermionehad her face turned away, but she hadn’t spoken out or even given himany sort of significant look, maybe because she’d been there in Potionstoo.Harry stood on a soft blue mat, such as might be found in a Muggledojo, which Professor Quirrell had laid out upon the floor for when Harrywas pushed down.296 *Harry was frightened of what he might do. If Professor Quirrell wasright about his intent to kill…Harry’s wand lay on Professor Quirrell’s desk, not because Harryknew any spells that could defend him, but because otherwise (Harrythought) he might have tried to jam it through someone’s eye socket. Hispouch lay there, now containing his protected but still potentially fragileTime-Turner.Harry had pleaded with Professor Quirrell to Transfigure him someboxing gloves and lock them on his hands. Professor Quirrell had givenhim a look of silent understanding, and refused.I will not go for their eyes, I will not go for their eyes, I will not go for theireyes, it would be the end of my life in Hogwarts, I’ll be arrested, Harry chantedto himself, trying to hammer the thought into his brain, hoping it wouldstay there if his intent to kill took over.Professor Quirrell returned, escorting thirteen older Slytherins of different years. Harry recognized one of them as the one he’d hit with a pie.Two others from that confrontation were also present. The one who’dsaid to stop, that they really shouldn’t do this, was missing.“I repeat,” Professor Quirrell said, sounding very stern, “Potter is notto be really hurt. Any and all accidents will be treated as deliberate. Do youunderstand?”The older Slytherins nodded, grinning.“Then please feel free to take the Boy-Who-Lived down a few pegs,”Professor Quirrell said, with a twisted smile that only the first-years understood.By some form of mutual consent, the pie-target was at the front of thegroup.“Potter,” said Professor Quirrell, “meet Mr. Peregrine Derrick. He isbetter than you and he is about to show you that.”Derrick strode forward and Harry’s brain screamed discordantly, hemust not run away, he must not fight back—Derrick stopped an arm’s length away from Harry.Harry wasn’t angry yet, just frightened. And that meant he behelda teenage boy fully half a meter taller than himself, with clearly definedmuscles, facial hair, and a grin of terrible anticipation.297 *“Ask him not to hurt you,” Professor Quirrell said. “Perhaps if he seesthat you’re pathetic enough, he’ll decide that you’re boring, and go away.”There was laughter from the watching older Slytherins.“Please,” Harry said, his voice faltering, “don’t, hurt, me…”“That didn’t sound very sincere,” said Professor Quirrell.Derrick’s smile widened. The clumsy imbecile was looking very superior and……Harry’s blood temperature was dropping…“Please don’t hurt me,” Harry tried again.Professor Quirrell shook his head. “How in Merlin’s name did youmanage to make that sound like an insult, Potter? There is only one response you can possibly expect from Mr. Derrick.”Derrick stepped forward deliberately, and bumped into Harry.Harry staggered back a few feet and, before he could stop himself,straightened up icily.“Wrong,” said Professor Quirrell, “wrong, wrong, wrong.”“You bumped into me, Potter,” Derrick said. “Apologize.”“I’m sorry!”“You don’t sound sorry,” said Derrick.Harry’s eyes widened in indignation, he had managed to make thatsound pleading—Derrick pushed him, hard, and Harry fell to the mat on his hands andknees.The blue fabric seemed to waver in Harry’s vision, not far away.He was beginning to doubt Professor Quirrell’s real motives in teaching this so-called lesson.A foot rested on Harry’s buttocks and a moment later Harry waspushed hard to the side, sending him sprawling on his back.Derrick laughed. “This is fun,” he said.All he had to do was say it was over. And report the whole thing to theHeadmaster’s office. That would be the end of this Defense Professor andhis ill-fated stay at Hogwarts and… Professor McGonagall would be angryabout that, but…(An image of Professor McGonagall’s face flashed before his eyes, shedidn’t look angry, just sad—)298 *“Now tell him that he’s better than you, Potter,” said Professor Quirrell’s voice.“You’re, better, than, me.”Harry started to raise himself and Derrick put a foot on his chest andshoved him back down to the mat.The world was becoming transparent as crystal. Lines of action andtheir consequences stretched out before him in utter clarity. The foolwouldn’t be expecting him to strike back, a quick hit in the groin wouldstun him long enough for—“Try again,” said Professor Quirrell and with a sudden sharp motionHarry rolled and sprang to his feet and whirled on where stood his realenemy, the Defense Professor—Professor Quirrell said, “You have no patience.”Harry faltered. His mind, well-honed in pessimism, drew a picture ofa wizened old man with blood pouring from his mouth after Harry hadripped his tongue out—A moment later, Derrick pushed Harry to the mat again and then satdown on him, sending Harry’s breath whooshing out.“Stop!” Harry screamed. “Please stop!”“Better,” said Professor Quirrell. “That even sounded sincere.”It had been. That was the horrible thing, the sickening thing, it hadbeen sincere. Harry was panting rapidly, fear and cold anger both flushing through him—“Lose,” said Professor Quirrell.“I, lose,” Harry forced out.“I like it,” Derrick said from on top of him. “Lose some more.”Hands shoved Harry, sending him stumbling across the circle of olderSlytherins to another set of hands that shoved him again. Harry had longsince passed the point of trying not to cry, and was now just trying not tofall down.“What are you, Potter?” said Derrick.299 *“A, l-loser, I lose, I give up, you win, you’re b-better, than me, pleasestop—”Harry tripped over a foot and went crashing to the ground, hands notquite able to catch himself. He was dazed for a moment, then began struggling to his feet again—“Enough!” said Professor Quirrell’s voice, sounding sharp enough tocut iron. “Step away from Mr. Potter!”Harry saw the surprised looks on their faces. The chill in his blood,which had been flowing and ebbing, smiled in cold satisfaction.Then Harry collapsed to the mat.Professor Quirrell talked. There were gasps from the older Slytherins.“And I believe the scion of Malfoy has something he wants to explainto you as well,” finished Professor Quirrell.Draco’s voice started talking. His voice sounded almost as sharp asprofessor Quirrell’s, it had acquired the same cadence Draco had usedto imitate his father, and it was saying things like could have put SlytherinHouse in jeopardy and who knows how many allies in this school alone and total lack of awareness, never mind cunning and dull thugs, useful for nothing butlackeys and something in Harry’s hindbrain, despite everything he knew,was designating Draco as an ally.Harry ached all over, was probably bruised, his body felt cold, hismind utterly exhausted. He tried to think of Fawkes’s song, but withoutthe phoenix present he couldn’t remember the melody and when hetried to imagine it he couldn’t seem to think of anything except a birdchirping.Then Draco stopped talking and Professor Quirrell told the olderSlytherins they were dismissed, and Harry opened his eyes and struggledto sit up, “Wait,” Harry said, forcing the words out, “there’s something, Iwant, to say, to them—”“Wait on Mr. Potter,” Professor Quirrell said coldly to the departingSlytherins.Harry swayed to his feet. He was careful not to look in the direction ofhis classmates. He didn’t want to see how they were looking at him now.He didn’t want to see their pity.So instead Harry looked at the older Slytherins, who still seemed tobe in a state of shock. They stared back at him. Dread was on their faces.His dark side, when it was in control, had held to the imagination ofthis moment, and went on pretending to lose.Harry said, “No one will—”“Stop,” said Professor Quirrell. “If that’s what I think it is, please waituntil after they’re gone. They’ll hear about it later. We all have our lessonsto learn, Mr. Potter.”“All right,” Harry said.“You. Go.”The older Slytherins fled and the door closed behind them.“No one’s to take any revenge on them,” Harry said hoarsely. “That’s arequest to anyone who considers themselves my friend. I had my lessonto learn, they helped me learn it, they had their lesson to learn too, it’sover. If you tell this story, make sure you tell that part too.”Harry turned to look at Professor Quirrell.“You lost,” said Professor Quirrell, his voice gentle for the first time. Itsounded strange coming from the professor, like his voice shouldn’t evenbe able to do that.Harry had lost. There had been moments when the cold anger hadfaded entirely, replaced by fear, and during those moments he’d beggedthe older Slytherins and he’d meant it…“And are you yet alive?” said Professor Quirrell, still with that strangegentleness.Harry managed to nod.“Not all losing is like this,” said Professor Quirrell. “There are compromises and negotiated surrenders. There are other ways to placate bullies.There is a whole art form to manipulating others by letting them be dominant over you. But first, losing must be thinkable. Will you rememberhow you lost?”“Yes.”“Will you be able to lose?”“I… think so…”“I think so too.” Professor Quirrell bowed so low that his thin hairalmost touched the floor. “Congratulations, Harry Potter, you win.”301 *There was no single source, no first mover, the applause started all atonce like a massive thunderclap.Harry’s couldn’t keep the shock from his face. He risked a glance athis classmates, and he saw their faces showing not pity but awe. Theapplause was coming from Ravenclaw and Gryffindor and Hufflepuffand even Slytherin, probably because Draco Malfoy was applauding too.Some students were standing up from their chairs and half of Gryffindorwas standing on their desks.So Harry stood there, swaying, letting their respect wash over him,feeling stronger, and maybe even a little healed.Professor Quirrell waited for the applause to die away. It took quite awhile.“Surprised, Mr. Potter?” Professor Quirrell said. His voice soundedamused. “You have just found out that the real world does not always worklike your worst nightmares. Yes, if you had been some poor anonymousboy being abused, then they would probably have respected you less afterward, pitied you even as they comforted you from their loftier perches.That is human nature, I’m afraid. But you they already know for a figureof power. And they saw you confront your fear and keep confronting it,even though you could have walked away at any time. Did you think lessof me when I told you that I had deliberately endured being spat upon?”Harry felt a burning sensation in his throat and frantically clampeddown. He didn’t trust this miraculous respect enough to start cryingagain in front of it.“Your extraordinary achievement in my class deserves an extraordinary reward, Harry Potter. Please accept it with my compliments onbehalf of my House, and remember from this day forward that not allSlytherins are alike. There are Slytherins, and then there are Slytherins.”Professor Quirrell was smiling quite broadly as he said this. “Fifty-onepoints to Ravenclaw.”There was a shocked pause and then pandemonium broke out amongthe Ravenclaw students, howling and whistling and cheering.(And in the same moment Harry felt something wrong about that, Professor McGonagall had been right, there should have been consequences,302 *there should have been a cost and a price to be paid, you couldn’t just puteverything back the way it was like that—)But Harry saw the elated faces in Ravenclaw and knew he couldn’tpossibly say no.His brain made a suggestion. It was a good suggestion. Harry couldnot even believe his brain was still keeping him upright, let alone producing good suggestions.“Professor Quirrell,” Harry said, as clearly as he could through hisburning throat. “You are everything a member of your House should be,and I think you must be just what Salazar Slytherin had in mind whenhe helped found Hogwarts. I thank you and your House,” Draco was veryslightly nodding and subtly turning his finger, keep going, “and I think thiscalls for three cheers for Slytherin. With me, everyone?” Harry paused.“Huzzah!” Only a few people managed to join in on the first try. “Huzzah!”This time most of Ravenclaw was in on it. “Huzzah!” That was almost allof Ravenclaw, a scattering of Hufflepuffs and around a quarter of Gryffindor.Draco’s hand moved into a small, quick, thumbs-up gesture.Most of the Slytherins had expressions of sheer shock. A few werestaring at Professor Quirrell in wonder. Blaise Zabini was looking atHarry with a calculating, intrigued expression.Professor Quirrell bowed. “Thank you, Harry Potter,” he said, still withthat broad smile. He turned to the class. “Now, believe it or not, we stillhave half an hour left in this session, and that is enough to introduce theSimple Shield. Mr. Potter, of course, is going off and taking a well-earnedrest.”“I can—”“Idiot,” Professor Quirrell said fondly. The class was already laughing. “Your classmates can teach you afterward, or I’ll tutor you privatelyif that’s what it takes. But right now, you’re going through the third doorfrom the left in the back of the stage, where you will find a bed, an assortment of exceptionally tasty snacks, and some extremely light readingfrom the Hogwarts library. You may not take anything else with you, particularly not your textbooks. Now go.”Harry went.303 *arry stared up at the gray ceiling of the small room, from where helay on the portable yet soft bed that had been placed there. He’deaten quite a lot of Professor Quirrell’s snacks—intricate confections ofchocolate and other substances, dusted with sparkling sprinkles and jeweled with tiny sugar gems, looking highly expensive and proving, in fact,to be quite tasty. Harry hadn’t felt the least bit guilty about it either, thishe had earned.He hadn’t tried to sleep. Harry had a feeling that he wouldn’t like whathappened when he closed his eyes.He hadn’t tried to read. He wouldn’t have been able to focus.Funny how Harry’s brain just seemed to keep on running and running, never shutting down no matter how tired it got. It got stupider butit refused to switch off.But there was, there really and truly was a feeling of triumph.Anti-Dark-Lord-Harry program, +1 point didn’t begin to cover it.Harry wondered what the Sorting Hat would say now, if he could put iton his head.No wonder Professor Quirrell had accused Harry of heading down thepath of a Dark Lord. Harry had been too slow on the uptake, he shouldhave seen the parallel right away—Understand that the Dark Lord did not win that day. His goal was to learnmartial arts, and yet he left without a single lesson.Harry had entered the Potions class with the intent to learn Potions.He’d left without a single lesson.305 *And Professor Quirrell had heard, and understood with frighteningprecision, and reached out and yanked Harry off that path, the path thatled to his becoming a copy of You-Know-Who.There was a knock at the door. “Classes are over,” said Professor Quirrell’s quiet voice.Harry approached the door and found himself suddenly nervous.Then the tension diminished as he heard Professor Quirrell’s footstepsmoving away from the door.What on Earth is that about? Is it what’s going to get him fired eventually?Harry opened the door, and saw that Professor Quirrell was now waiting several bodylengths away.Does Professor Quirrell feel it too?They walked across the now-deserted stage to Professor Quirrell’sdesk, which Professor Quirrell leaned on; and Harry, as before, stoppedshort of the dais.“So,” Professor Quirrell said. There was a friendly sense about himsomehow, even though his face still kept its usual seriousness. “What wasit you wanted to talk to me about, Mr. Potter?”I have a mysterious dark side. But Harry couldn’t just blurt it out likethat.“Professor Quirrell,” Harry said, “am I off the path to becoming a DarkLord, now?”Professor Quirrell looked at Harry. “Mr. Potter,” he said solemnly,with only a slight grin, “a word of advice. There is such a thing as a performance which is too perfect. Real people who have just been beatenand humiliated for fifteen minutes do not stand up and graciously forgive their enemies. It is the sort of thing you do when you’re trying toconvince everyone you’re not Dark, not—”“I can’t believe this! You can’t have every possible observation confirm yourtheory!”“And that was a trifle too much indignation.”“What on Earth do I have to do to convince you?”“To convince me that you harbor no ambitions of becoming a DarkLord?” said Professor Quirrell, now looking outright amused. “I supposeyou could just raise your right hand.”306 *“What?” Harry said blankly. “But I can raise my right hand whetheror not I—” Harry stopped, feeling rather stupid.“Indeed,” said Professor Quirrell. “You can just as easily do it eitherway. There is nothing you can do to convince me because I would knowthat was exactly what you were trying to do. And if we are to be even moreprecise, then while I suppose it is barely possible that perfectly good people exist even though I have never met one, it is nonetheless improbablethat someone would be beaten for fifteen minutes and then stand up andfeel a great surge of kindly forgiveness for his attackers. On the otherhand it is less improbable that a young child would imagine this as therole to play in order to convince his teacher and classmates that he is notthe next Dark Lord. The import of an act lies not in what that act resembles on the surface, Mr. Potter, but in the states of mind which make thatact more or less probable.”Harry blinked. He’d just had the dichotomy between the representativeness heuristic and the Bayesian definition of evidence explained tohim by a wizard.“But then again,” said Professor Quirrell, “anyone can want to impress their friends. That need not be Dark. So without it being anykind of admission, Mr. Potter, tell me honestly. What thought was inyour mind at the moment when you forbade any vengeance? Was thatthought a true impulse to forgiveness? Or was it an awareness of howyour classmates would see the act?”Sometimes we make our own phoenix song.But Harry didn’t say it out loud. It was clear that Professor Quirrellwouldn’t believe him, and would probably respect him less for trying toutter such a transparent lie.After a few moments of silence, Professor Quirrell smiled with satisfaction. “Believe it or not, Mr. Potter,” said the professor, “you need notfear me for having discovered your secret. I am not going to tell you togive up on becoming the next Dark Lord. If I could turn back the handsof time and somehow remove that ambition from the mind of my childself, the self of this present time would not benefit from the alteration.For as long as I thought that was my goal, it drove me to study and learnand refine myself and become stronger. We become what we are meant307 *to be by following our desires wherever they lead. That is the insight ofSalazar. Ask me to show you to the library section which holds those samebooks I read as a thirteen-year-old, and I will happily lead the way.”“For the love of crap,” Harry said, and sat down on the hard marblefloor, and then lay back on the floor, staring up at the distant arches of theceiling. It was as close as he could come to collapsing in despair withouthurting himself.“Still too much indignation,” observed Professor Quirrell. Harrywasn’t looking but he could hear the suppressed laughter in the voice.Then Harry realized.“Actually, I think I know what’s confusing you here,” Harry said. “Thatwas what I wanted to talk to you about, in fact. Professor Quirrell, I thinkthat what you’re seeing is my mysterious dark side.”There was a pause.“Your… dark side…”Harry sat up. Professor Quirrell was regarding him with one of thestrangest expressions Harry had seen on anyone’s face, let alone anyoneas dignified as Professor Quirrell.“It happens when I get angry,” Harry explained. “My blood runs cold,everything gets cold, everything seems perfectly clear… In retrospect it’sbeen with me for a while—in my first year of Muggle school, someonetried to take away my ball during recess and I held it behind my back andkicked him in the solar plexus which I’d read was a weak point, and theother kids didn’t bother me after that. And I bit a math teacher when shewouldn’t accept my dominance. But it’s only just recently that I’ve beenunder enough stress to notice that it’s an actual, you know, mysteriousdark side, and not just an anger management problem like the schoolpsychologist said. And I don’t have any super magical powers when ithappens, that was one of the first things I checked.”Professor Quirrell rubbed his nose. “Let me think about this,” he said.Harry waited in silence for a full minute. He used that time to standup, which was more difficult than he had expected.“Well,” Professor Quirrell said after a while. “I suppose there wassomething you could say that would convince me.”“I have already guessed that my dark side is really just another part ofme and that the answer isn’t to never become angry but to learn to stay incontrol by accepting it, I’m not dumb or anything and I’ve seen this storyenough times to know where it’s going, but it’s hard and you seem likethe person to help me.”“Well… yes… very perspicacious of you, Mr. Potter, I must say… thatside of you is, as you seem to have already surmised, your intent to kill,which as you say is a part of you…”“And needs to be trained,” Harry said, completing the pattern.“And needs to be trained, yes.” That strange expression was still onProfessor Quirrell’s face. “Mr. Potter, if you truly do not wish to be thenext Dark Lord, then what was the ambition which the Sorting Hat triedto convince you to abandon, the ambition for which you were Sorted intoSlytherin?”“I was Sorted into Ravenclaw!”“Mr. Potter,” said Professor Quirrell, now with a much more usuallooking dry smile, “I know you are accustomed to everyone around youbeing a fool, but please do not mistake me for one of them. The likelihood that the Sorting Hat would play its first prank in eight hundredyears while it was upon your head is so small as to not be worth considering. I suppose it is barely possible that you snapped your fingers andinvented some simple and clever way to defeat the anti-tampering spellsupon the Hat, though I myself can think of no such method. But by farthe most probable explanation is that Dumbledore decided he was nothappy with the Hat’s choice for the Boy-Who-Lived. This is evident toanyone with the tiniest smidgin of common sense, so your secret is safeat Hogwarts.”Harry opened his mouth, then closed it again with a feeling of complete helplessness. Professor Quirrell was wrong, but wrong in such aconvincing way that Harry was starting to think that it simply was the rational judgment given the evidence available to Professor Quirrell. Therewere times, never predictable times but still sometimes, when you wouldget improbable evidence and the best knowable guess would be wrong.If you had a medical test that was only wrong one time in a thousand,sometimes it would still be wrong anyway.“Can I ask you never to repeat what I’m about to say?” said Harry.“Absolutely,” said Professor Quirrell. “Consider me asked.”Harry wasn’t a fool either. “Can I consider you to have said yes?”“Very good, Mr. Potter. You may indeed so consider.”“Professor Quirrell—”“I won’t repeat what you’re about to say,” Professor Quirrell said, smiling.They both laughed, then Harry turned serious again. “The SortingHat did seem to think I was going to end up as a Dark Lord unless I wentto Hufflepuff,” Harry said. “But I don’t want to be one.”“Mr. Potter…” said Professor Quirrell. “Don’t take this the wrong way.I promise you will not be graded on the answer. I only want to know yourown, honest reply. Why not?”Harry had that helpless feeling again. Thou shalt not become a Dark Lordwas such an obvious theorem in his moral system that it was hard to describe the actual proof steps. “Um, people would get hurt?”“Surely you’ve wanted to hurt people,” said Professor Quirrell. “Youwanted to hurt those bullies today. Being a Dark Lord means that peopleyou want to hurt get hurt.”Harry floundered for words and then decided to simply go with theobvious. “First of all, just because I want to hurt someone doesn’t meanit’s right—”“What makes something right, if not your wanting it?”“Ah,” Harry said, “preference utilitarianism.”“Pardon me?” said Professor Quirrell.“It’s the ethical theory that the good is what satisfies the preferencesof the most people—”“No,” Professor Quirrell said. His fingers rubbed the bridge of hisnose. “I don’t think that’s quite what I was trying to say. Mr. Potter, inthe end people all do what they want to do. Sometimes people give nameslike ‘right’ to things they want to do, but how could we possibly act on anything but our own desires?”“Well, obviously,” Harry said. “I couldn’t act on moral considerationsif they lacked the power to move me. But that doesn’t mean my wanting310 *to hurt those Slytherins has the power to move me more than moral considerations!”Professor Quirrell blinked.“Not to mention,” Harry said, “being a Dark Lord would mean that alot of innocent bystanders got hurt too!”“Why does that matter to you?” Professor Quirrell said. “What havethey done for you?”Harry laughed. “Oh, now that was around as subtle as Atlas Shrugged.”“Pardon me?” Professor Quirrell said again.“It’s a book that my parents wouldn’t let me read because they thoughtit would corrupt me, so of course I read it anyway and I was offended theythought I would fall for any traps that obvious. Blah blah blah, appeal tomy sense of superiority, other people are trying to keep me down, blahblah blah.”“So you’re saying I need to make my traps less obvious?” said Professor Quirrell. He tapped a finger on his cheek, looking thoughtful. “I canwork on that.”They both laughed.“But to stay with the current question,” said Professor Quirrell, “whathave all these other people done for you?”“Other people have done huge amounts for me!” Harry said. “My parents took me in when my parents died because they were good people, andto become a Dark Lord is to betray that!”Professor Quirrell was silent for a time.“I confess,” said Professor Quirrell quietly, “when I was your age, thatthought could not ever have come to me.”“I’m sorry,” Harry said.“Don’t be,” said Professor Quirrell. “It was long ago, and I resolvedmy parental issues to my own satisfaction. So you are held back by thethought of your parents’ disapproval? Does that mean that if they died inan accident, there would be nothing left to stop you from—”“No,” Harry said. “Just no. It is their impulse to kindness which sheltered me. That impulse is not only in my parents. And that impulse iswhat would be betrayed.”“In any case, Mr. Potter, you have not answered my original question,”said Professor Quirrell finally. “What is your ambition?”“Oh,” said Harry. “Um..” He organized his thoughts. “To understandeverything important there is to know about the universe, apply thatknowledge to become omnipotent, and use that power to rewrite realitybecause I have some objections to the way it works now.”There was a slight pause.“Forgive me if this is a stupid question, Mr. Potter,” said ProfessorQuirrell, “but are you sure you did not just confess to wanting to be a DarkLord?”“That’s only if you use your power for evil,” explained Harry. “If youuse the power for good, you’re a Light Lord.”“I see,” Professor Quirrell said. He tapped his other cheek with a finger. “I suppose I can work with that. But Mr. Potter, while the scope ofyour ambition is worthy of Salazar himself, how exactly do you proposeto go about it? Is step one to become a great fighting wizard, or HeadUnspeakable, or Minister of Magic, or—”“Step one is to become a scientist.”Professor Quirrell was looking at Harry as if he’d just turned into acat.“A scientist,” Professor Quirrell said after a while.Harry nodded.“A scientist?” repeated Professor Quirrell.“Yes,” Harry said. “I shall achieve my objectives through the power…of Science!”“A scientist!” said Professor Quirrell. There was genuine indignationon his face, and his voice had grown stronger and sharper. “You couldbe the best of all my students! The greatest fighting wizard to come outof Hogwarts in five decades! I cannot picture you wasting your days in awhite lab coat doing pointless things to rats!”“Hey!” said Harry. “There’s more to science than that! Not that there’sanything wrong with experimenting on rats, of course. But science is howyou go about understanding and controlling the universe—”“Fool,” said Professor Quirrell, in a voice of quiet, bitter intensity.“You’re a fool, Harry Potter.” He passed a hand over his face, and whenthat hand had passed, his face was calmer. “Or more likely you have notyet found your true ambition. May I strongly recommend that you try tobecome a Dark Lord instead? I will do anything I can to help as a matterof public service.”“You don’t like science,” Harry said slowly. “Why not?”“Those fool Muggles will kill us all someday!” Professor Quirrell’svoice had grown louder. “They will end it! End all of it!”Harry was feeling a bit lost here. “What are we talking about here,nuclear weapons?”“Yes, nuclear weapons!” Professor Quirrell was almost shouting now.“Even He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named never used those, perhaps becausehe didn’t want to rule over a heap of ash! They never should have beenmade! And it will only get worse with time!” Professor Quirrell was standing up straight instead of leaning on his desk. “There are gates you do notopen, there are seals you do not breach! The fools who can’t resist meddling are killed by the lesser perils early on, and the survivors all knowthat there are secrets you do not share with anyone who lacks the intelligence and the discipline to discover them for themselves! Every powerful wizard knows that! Even the most terrible Dark Wizards know that!And those idiot Muggles can’t seem to figure it out! The eager little foolswho discovered the secret of nuclear weapons didn’t keep it to themselves,they told their fool politicians and now we must live under the constantthreat of annihilation!”This was a rather different way of looking at things than Harry hadgrown up with. It had never occurred to him that nuclear physicistsshould have formed a conspiracy of silence to keep the secret of nuclearweapons from anyone not smart enough to be a nuclear physicist. Thethought was intriguing, if nothing else. Would they have had secretpasswords? Would they have had masks?(Actually, for all Harry knew, there were all sorts of incredibly destructive secrets which physicists kept to themselves, and the secret of nuclearweapons was the only one that had escaped into the wild. The worldwould look the same to him either way.)“I’ll have to think about that,” Harry said to Professor Quirrell. “It’sa new idea to me. And one of the hidden secrets of science, passed downfrom a few rare teachers to their grad students, is how to avoid flushingnew ideas down the toilet the instant you hear one you don’t like.”Professor Quirrell blinked again.“Is there any sort of science you do approve of?” said Harry. “Medicine,maybe?”“Space travel,” said Professor Quirrell. “But the Muggles seem to bedragging their feet on the one project which might have let wizardkindescape this planet before they blow it up.”Harry nodded. “I’m a big fan of the space program too. At least wehave that much in common.”Professor Quirrell looked at Harry. Something flickered in the professor’s eyes. “I will have your word, your promise and your oath never tospeak of what follows.”“You have it,” Harry said immediately.“See to it that you keep your oath or you will not like the results,” saidProfessor Quirrell. “I will now cast a rare and powerful spell, not on you,but on the classroom around us. Stand still, so that you do not touch theboundaries of the spell once it has been cast. You must not interact withthe magic which I am maintaining. Look only. Otherwise I will end thespell.” Professor Quirrell paused. “And try not to fall over.”Harry nodded, puzzled and anticipatory.Professor Quirrell raised his wand and said something that Harry’sears and mind couldn’t grasp at all, words that bypassed awareness andvanished into oblivion.The marble in a short radius around Harry’s feet stayed constant. Allthe other marble of the floor vanished, the walls and ceilings vanished.Harry stood on a small circle of white marble in the midst of an endless field of stars, burning terribly bright and unwavering. There was noEarth, no Moon, no Sun that Harry recognized. Professor Quirrell stoodin the same place as before, floating in the midst of the starfield. TheMilky Way was already visible as a great wash of light and it grew brighteras Harry’s vision adjusted to the darkness.The sight wrenched at Harry’s heart like nothing he had ever seen.“Are we… in space…?”“No,” said Professor Quirrell. His voice was sad, and reverent. “But itis a true image.”Tears came into Harry’s eyes. He wiped them away frantically, hewould not miss this for some stupid water blurring his vision.The stars were no longer tiny jewels set in a giant velvet dome, as theywere in the night sky of Earth. Here there was no sky above, no surrounding sphere. Only points of perfect light against perfect blackness, an infinite and empty void with countless tiny holes through which shone thebrilliance from some unimaginable realm beyond.In space, the stars looked terribly, terribly, terribly far away.Harry kept on wiping his eyes, over and over.“Sometimes,” Professor Quirrell said in a voice so quiet it almostwasn’t there, “when this flawed world seems unusually hateful, I wonderwhether there might be some other place, far away, where I should havebeen. I cannot seem to imagine what that place might be, and if I can’teven imagine it then how can I believe it exists? And yet the universe isso very, very wide, and perhaps it might exist anyway? But the stars areso very, very far away. It would take a long, long time to get there, evenif I knew the way. And I wonder what I would dream about, if I slept fora long, long time…”Though it felt like sacrilege, Harry managed a whisper. “Please let mestay here awhile.”Professor Quirrell nodded, where he stood unsupported against thestars.It was easy to forget the small circle of marble on which you stood, andyour own body, and become a point of awareness which might have beenstill, or might have been moving. With all distances incalculable therewas no way to tell.There was a time of no time.And then the stars vanished, and the classroom returned.“I’m sorry,” said Professor Quirrell, “but we’re about to have company.”“It’s fine,” Harry whispered. “It was enough.” He would never forgetthis day, and not because of the unimportant things that had happenedearlier. He would learn how to cast that spell if it was the last thing heever learned.Then the heavy oaken doors of the classroom blasted off their hingesand skittered across the marble floor with a high-pitched shriek.Like a vast thundercloud, an ancient and powerful wizard blew intothe room, a look of such incandescent rage upon his face that the sternlook he had earlier turned upon Harry seemed like nothing.There was a wrench of disorientation in Harry’s mind as the part thatwanted to run away screaming from the scariest thing it had ever seenran away, rotating into place a part of him which could take the shock.None of Harry’s facets were happy about having their star-gazinginterrupted. “Headmaster Albus Percival—” Harry started to say in icytones.WHAM. Professor Quirrell’s hand came down hard upon his desk.“Mr. Potter!” barked Professor Quirrell. “This is the Headmaster of Hogwarts and you are a mere student! You will address him appropriately!”Harry looked at Professor Quirrell.Professor Quirrell was giving Harry a stern glare.Neither of them smiled.Dumbledore’s long strides had come to a halt before where Harrystood in front of the dais and Professor Quirrell stood by his desk. TheHeadmaster stared in shock at both of them.“I’m sorry,” Harry said in meekly polite tones. “Headmaster, thankyou for wanting to protect me, but Professor Quirrell did the right thing.”Slowly, Dumbledore’s expression changed from something thatwould vaporize steel into something merely angry. “I heard studentssaying that this man had you abused by older Slytherins! That he forbadeyou to defend yourself!”Harry nodded. “He knew exactly what was wrong with me and heshowed me how to fix it.”“Harry, what are you talking about?”“I was teaching him how to lose,” Professor Quirrell said dryly. “It’san important life skill.”It was apparent that Dumbledore still didn’t understand, but his voicehad lowered in register. “Harry…” he said slowly. “If there’s any threat theDefense Professor has offered you to prevent you from complaining—”You lunatic, after today of all days do you really think I—“Headmaster,” Harry said, trying to look abashed, “what’s wrong withme isn’t that I keep quiet about abusive professors.”Professor Quirrell chuckled. “Not perfect, Mr. Potter, but goodenough for your first day. Headmaster, did you stay long enough to hearabout the fifty-one points for Ravenclaw, or did you storm out as soon asyou heard the first part?”A brief look of disconcertment crossed Dumbledore’s face, followedby surprise. “Fifty-one points for Ravenclaw?”Professor Quirrell nodded. “He wasn’t expecting them, but it seemedappropriate. Tell Professor McGonagall that I think the story of whatMr. Potter went through to earn back the lost points will do just as well tomake her point. No, Headmaster, Mr. Potter didn’t tell me anything. It’seasy to see which part of today’s events are her work, just as I know thatthe final compromise was your own suggestion. Though I wonder howon Earth Mr. Potter was able to gain the upper hand over both Snape andyou and then Professor McGonagall was able to gain the upper hand overhim.”Somehow Harry managed to control his face. Was it that obvious to areal Slytherin?Dumbledore came closer to Harry, scrutinizing. “Your color looks alittle off, Harry,” the old wizard said. He peered closely at Harry’s face.“What did you have for lunch today?”“What?” Harry said, his mind wobbling in sudden confusion. Whywould Dumbledore be asking about deep-fried lamb and thin-sliced broccoli when that was just about the last probable cause of—The old wizard straightened up. “Never mind, then. I think you’refine.”Professor Quirrell coughed, loudly and deliberately. Harry lookedat the professor, and saw that Professor Quirrell was staring sharply atDumbledore.“Ah-hem!” Professor Quirrell said again.Dumbledore and Professor Quirrell locked eyes, and somethingseemed to pass between them.“If you don’t tell him,” Professor Quirrell said then, “I will, even if youfire me for it.”Dumbledore sighed and turned back to Harry. “I apologize for invading your mental privacy, Mr. Potter,” the Headmaster said formally. “Ihad no purpose except to determine if Professor Quirrell had done thesame.”What?The confusion lasted just exactly as long as it took Harry to understand what had just happened.“You—!”“Gently, Mr. Potter,” said Professor Quirrell. His face was hard, however, as he stared at Dumbledore.“Legilimency is sometimes mistaken for common sense,” said theHeadmaster. “But it leaves traces which another skillful Legilimens candetect. That was all I looked for, Mr. Potter, and I asked you an irrelevantquestion to ensure you wouldn’t think about anything important while Ilooked.”“You should have asked first!”Professor Quirrell shook his head. “No, Mr. Potter, the Headmasterhad some justification for his concerns, and had he asked for permission you would have thought of exactly those things you did not wish himto see.” Professor Quirrell’s voice grew sharper. “I am rather more concerned, Headmaster, that you saw no need to tell him afterward!”“You have now made it more difficult to confirm his mental privacy onfuture occasions,” Dumbledore said. He favored Professor Quirrell witha cold look. “Was that your intention, I wonder?”Professor Quirrell’s expression was implacable. “There are too manyLegilimens in this school. I insist that Mr. Potter receive instruction inOcclumency. Will you permit me to be his tutor?”“Absolutely not,” Dumbledore said at once.“I did not think so. Then since you have deprived him of my free services, you will pay for Mr. Potter’s tutoring by a licensed Occlumency instructor.”“Such services do not come cheaply,” Dumbledore said, lookingat Professor Quirrell in some surprise. “Although I do have certainconnections—”Professor Quirrell shook his head firmly. “No. Mr. Potter will askhis account manager at Gringotts to recommend a neutral instructor.With respect, Headmaster Dumbledore, after the events of this morningI must protest you or your friends having access to Mr. Potter’s mind.I must also insist that the instructor have taken an Unbreakable Vowto reveal nothing, and that he agree to be Obliviated of each sessionimmediately afterward.”Dumbledore was frowning. “Such services are extremely expensive, asyou well know, and I cannot help but wonder why you deem them necessary.”“If it’s money that’s the problem,” Harry spoke up, “I have some ideasfor making large amounts of money quickly—”“Thank you Quirinus, your wisdom is now quite evident and I amsorry for disputing it. Your concern for Harry Potter does you credit, aswell.”“You’re welcome,” said Professor Quirrell. “I hope you will not objectif I go on making him a particular focus of my attentions.” Professor Quirrell’s face was now very serious, and very still.Dumbledore looked at Harry.“It is my own wish also,” Harry said.“So that’s how it is to be…” the old wizard said slowly. Somethingstrange passed across his face. “Harry… you must realize that if youchoose this man as your teacher and your friend, your first mentor, thenone way or another you will lose him, and the manner in which you losehim may or may not allow you to ever get him back.”That hadn’t occurred to Harry. But there was that jinx on the Defenseposition… one which had apparently worked with perfect regularity fordecades…“Probably,” said Professor Quirrell quietly, “but he will have the fulluse of me while I last.”Dumbledore sighed. “I suppose it is economical, at least, since as theDefense Professor you’re already doomed in some unknown fashion.”Harry had to work hard to suppress his expression as he realized whatDumbledore had actually been implying.“I will inform Madam Pince that Mr. Potter is allowed to obtain bookson Occlumency,” said Dumbledore.“There is preliminary training which you must do on your own,” saidProfessor Quirrell to Harry. “And I do suggest that you hurry up on it.”Harry nodded.“I’ll take my leave of you then,” said Dumbledore. He nodded to bothHarry and Professor Quirrell, and departed, walking a bit slowly.“Can you cast the spell again?” Harry said the moment Dumbledorewas gone.“Not today,” said Professor Quirrell quietly, “and not tomorrow either,I’m afraid. It takes a lot out of me to cast, though less to keep going, andso I usually prefer to maintain it as long as possible. This time I cast it onimpulse. Had I thought, and realized we might be interrupted—”Dumbledore was now Harry’s least favorite person in the entireworld.They both sighed.“Even if I only ever see it once,” Harry said, “I will never stop beinggrateful to you.”Professor Quirrell nodded.“Have you heard of the Pioneer program?” Harry said. “They wereprobes that would fly by different planets and take pictures. Two of theprobes would end up on trajectories that took them out of the Solar System and into interstellar space. So they put a golden plaque on the probes,with a picture of a man, and a woman, and showing where to find our Sunin the galaxy.”Professor Quirrell was silent for a moment, then smiled. “Tell me,Mr. Potter, can you guess what thought went through my mind when Ifinished assembling the thirty-seven items on the list of things I wouldnever do as a Dark Lord? Put yourself in my shoes—imagine yourself inmy place—and guess.”Harry imagined himself looking over a list of thirty-seven things notto do once he became a Dark Lord.320 *“You decided that if you had to follow the whole list all the time, therewouldn’t be much point in becoming a Dark Lord in the first place,” Harrysaid.“Precisely,” said Professor Quirrell. He was grinning. “So I am going toviolate rule two—which was simply ‘don’t brag’—and tell you about something I have done. I don’t see how the knowledge could do any harm.And I strongly suspect you would have figured it out anyway, once weknew each other well enough. Nonetheless… I shall have your oath neverto speak of what I am about to tell.”“You have it!” Harry had a feeling this was going to be really good.“I subscribe to a Muggle bulletin which keeps me informed ofprogress on space travel. I didn’t hear about Pioneer 10 until they reported its launch. But when I discovered that Pioneer 11 would also beleaving the Solar System forever,” Professor Quirrell said, his grin thewidest that Harry had yet seen from him, “I snuck into NASA, I did, andI cast a lovely little spell on that lovely golden plaque which will make itlast a lot longer than it otherwise would.”………“Yes,” Professor Quirrell said, who now seemed to be standing aroundfifty feet taller, “I thought that was how you might react.”………“Mr. Potter?”“…I can’t think of anything to say.”“‘You win’ seems appropriate,” said Professor Quirrell.“You win,” Harry said immediately.“See?” said Professor Quirrell. “We can only imagine what giant heapof trouble you would have gotten into if you had been unable to say that.”They both laughed.A further thought occurred to Harry. “You didn’t add any extra information to the plaque, did you?”“Extra information?” said Professor Quirrell, sounding as if the ideahad never occurred to him before and he was quite intrigued.Which made Harry rather suspicious, considering that it’d taken lessthan a minute for Harry to think of it.“Maybe you included a holographic message like in Star Wars?” saidHarry. “Or… hm. A portrait seems to store a whole human brain’s worthof information… you couldn’t have added any extra mass to the probe, butmaybe you could’ve turned an existing part into a portrait of yourself? Oryou found a volunteer dying of a terminal illness, snuck them into NASA,and cast a spell to make sure their ghost ended up in the plaque—”“Mr. Potter,” Professor Quirrell said, his voice suddenly sharp, “a spellrequiring a human death would certainly be classified by the Ministry asDark Arts, regardless of circumstances. Students should not be heardtalking about such things.”And the amazing thing about the way Professor Quirrell said it washow perfectly it maintained plausible deniability. It had been said in exactly the appropriate tone for someone who wasn’t willing to discuss suchthings and thought students should steer away from them. Harry honestly didn’t know whether Professor Quirrell was just waiting to talk aboutit until after Harry had learned to protect his mind.“Got it,” Harry said. “I won’t talk with anyone else about that idea.”“Please be discreet about the whole matter, Mr. Potter,” ProfessorQuirrell said. “I prefer to go through my life without attracting publicnotice. You will find nothing in the newspapers about Quirinus Quirrelluntil I decided it was time for me to teach Defense at Hogwarts.”That seemed a little sad, but Harry understood. Then Harry realizedthe implications. “So just how much awesome stuff have you done thatno one else knows about—”“Oh, some,” said Professor Quirrell. “But I think that’s quite enoughfor today, Mr. Potter, I confess I am feeling a bit tired—”“I understand. And thank you. For everything.”Professor Quirrell nodded, but he was leaning harder on his desk.Harry quickly took his leave.322 *ermione Granger had worried she was turning Bad.The difference between Good and Bad was usually easy to grasp, she’dnever understood why other people had so much trouble. At Hogwarts,“Good” was Professor Flitwick and Professor McGonagall and ProfessorSprout. “Bad” was Professor Snape and Professor Quirrell and Draco Malfoy. Harry Potter… was one of those unusual cases where you couldn’t telljust by looking. She was still trying to figure out where he belonged.But when it came to herself …Hermione was having too much fun crushing Harry Potter.She’d done better than him in every single class they’d taken. (Exceptfor broomstick riding which was like gym class, it didn’t count.) She’dgotten real House points almost every day of their first week, not for weirdheroic things, but smart things like learning spells quickly and helpingother students. She knew those kinds of House points were better, andthe best part was, Harry Potter knew it too. She could see it in his eyesevery time she won another real House point.If you were Good, you weren’t supposed to enjoy winning this much.It had started on the day of the train ride, though it had taken a whilefor the whirlwind to sink in. It wasn’t until later that night that Hermionehad begun to realize just how much she’d let that boy walk all over her.Before she’d met Harry Potter she hadn’t had anyone she’d wanted tocrush. If someone wasn’t doing as well as her in class, it was her job tohelp them, not rub it in. That was what it meant to be Good.And now…323 *…now she was winning, Harry Potter was flinching every time she gotanother House point, and it was so much fun, her parents had warned heragainst drugs and she suspected this was more fun than that.She’d always liked the smiles that teachers gave her when she didsomething right. She’d always liked seeing the long row of check-markson a perfectly answered test. But now when she did well in class shewould casually glance around and catch a glimpse of Harry Potter gritting his teeth, and it made her want to burst into song like a Disneymovie.That was Bad, wasn’t it?Hermione had worried she was turning Bad.And then a thought had come to her which wiped away all her fears.She and Harry were getting into a Romance! Of course! Everyoneknew what it meant when a boy and a girl started fighting all the time.They were courting one another! There was nothing Bad about that.It couldn’t be that she just enjoyed beating the living scholastic daylights out of the most famous student in the school, someone who wasin books and talked like books, the boy who had somehow vanquished theDark Lord and even smushed Professor Snape like a sad little bug, the boywho was, as Professor Quirrell would have put it, dominant, over everyone else in first-year Ravenclaw except for Hermione Granger who wasutterly squishing the Boy-Who-Lived in all his classes besides broomstickriding.Because that would have been Bad.No. It was Romance. That was it. That was why they were fighting.Hermione was glad she had figured this out in time for today, whenHarry would lose their book-reading contest, which the whole school knewabout, and she wanted to start dancing with the sheer overflowing joy ofit.It was 2:45pm on Saturday and Harry Potter had half of BathildaBagshot’s A History of Magic left to read and she was staring at her pocketwatch as it ticked with dreadful slowness toward 2:47pm.And the entire Ravenclaw common room was watching.It wasn’t just the first-years, news had spread like spilled milk andfully half of Ravenclaw was crowded into the room, squeezed into so*324 *fas and leaning on bookcases and sitting on the arms of chairs. All sixprefects were there including the Head Girl of Hogwarts. Someone hadneeded to cast an Air-Freshening Charm just so that there would beenough oxygen. And the din of conversation had died into whisperswhich had now faded into utter silence.2:46pm.The tension was unbearable. If it had been anyone else, anyone else,his defeat would have been a foregone conclusion.But this was Harry Potter, and you couldn’t rule out the possibilitythat he would, sometime in the next few seconds, raise a hand and snaphis fingers.With sudden terror she realized how Harry Potter might be able todo exactly that. It would be just like him to have already finished reading thesecond half of the book earlier…Hermione’s vision began to swim. She tried to make herself breathe,and found that she simply couldn’t.Ten seconds left, and he still hadn’t raised his hand.Five seconds left.2:47pm.Harry Potter carefully placed a bookmark into his book, closed it, andlaid it aside.“I would like to note for the benefit of posterity,” said the Boy-WhoLived in a clear voice, “that I had only half a book left, and that I ran intoa number of unexpected delays—”“You lost!” shrieked Hermione. “You did! You lost our contest!”There was a collective exhalation as everyone started breathing again.Harry Potter shot her a Look of Flaming Fire, but she was floating ina halo of pure white happiness and nothing could touch her.“Do you realize what kind of week I’ve had?” said Harry Potter. “Any lesserbeing would have been hard-pressed to read eight Dr. Seuss books!”“You set the time limit.”Harry’s Look of Flaming Fire grew even hotter. “I did not have anylogical way of knowing I’d have to save the entire school from ProfessorSnape, or get beaten up in Defense class, and if I told you how I lost all325 *the time between 5pm and dinner on Thursday you would think I wasinsane—”“Awww, it sounds like someone fell prey to the planning fallacy.”Raw shock showed on Harry Potter’s face.“Oh that reminds me, I finished reading the first batch of books youlent me,” Hermione said with her best innocent look. A couple of themhad been hard books, too. She wondered how long it had taken him tofinish reading them.“Someday,” said the Boy-Who-Lived, “when the distant descendantsof Homo sapiens are looking back over the history of the galaxy and wondering how it all went so wrong, they will conclude that the original mistake was when someone taught Hermione Granger how to read.”“But you still lose,” said Hermione. She held a hand to her chin andlooked contemplative. “Now what exactly should you lose, I wonder?”“What?”“You lost the bet,” Hermione explained, “so you have to pay a forfeit.”“I don’t remember agreeing to this!”“Really?” said Hermione Granger. She put a thoughtful look on herface. Then, as if the idea had only just then occurred to her, “We’ll takea vote, then. Everyone in Ravenclaw who thinks Harry Potter has to payup, raise your hand!”“What?” shrieked Harry Potter again.He spun around and saw that he was surrounded by a sea of raisedhands.And if Harry Potter had looked more carefully, he would have noticedthat an awful lot of the onlookers seemed to be girls and that practicallyevery female in the room had their hand raised.“Stop!” wailed Harry Potter. “You don’t know what she’s going to ask!Don’t you realize what she’s doing? She’s getting you to make an advancecommitment now, and then the pressure of consistency will make youagree with whatever she says afterward!”“Don’t worry,” said the prefect Penelope Clearwater. “If she asks forsomething unreasonable, we can just change our minds. Right, everyone?”326 *And there were eager nods from all the girls whom Penelope Clearwater had told about Hermione’s plan.A silent figure quietly slipped through the chilled halls of the Hogwartsdungeons. He was to be present in a certain room at 6:00pm to meeta certain someone, and if at all possible it was best to be early, to showrespect.But when his hand turned the doorknob and opened the door intothat dark, silent, unused classroom, there was a silhouette already standing there amid the rows of dusty old desks. A silhouette which held a smallgreen glowing rod, casting a pale light which hardly illuminated even hewho held it, let alone the surrounding room.The light of the hallway died as the door closed and shut behind him,and Draco’s eyes began the process of adjusting to the dim glow.The silhouette slowly turned to behold him, revealing a shadowed faceonly partially lit by the eerie green light.Draco liked this meeting already. Keep the chill green light, makethem both taller, give them hoods and masks, move them from a classroom to a graveyard, and it would be just like the start of half the storieshis father’s friends told about the Death Eaters.“I want you to know, Draco Malfoy,” said the silhouette in tones ofdeadly calm, “that I do not blame you for my recent defeat.”Draco opened his mouth in unthinking protest, there was no possiblereason why he should be blamed—“It was due, more than anything else, to my own stupidity,” continuedthat shadowy figure. “There were many other things I could have done,at any step along the way. You did not ask me to do exactly what I did.You only asked for help. I was the one who unwisely chose that particularmethod. But the fact remains that I lost the contest by half a book. Theactions of your pet idiot, and the favor you asked for, and, yes, my ownfoolishness in going about it, caused me to lose time. More time than youknow. Time which, in the end, proved critical. The fact remains, Draco327 *Malfoy, that if you had not asked that favor, I would have won. And not…instead… lost.”Draco had already heard about Harry’s loss, and the forfeit Grangerhad claimed from him. The news had spread faster than owls could havecarried it.“I understand,” Draco said. “I’m sorry.” There was nothing else hecould say if he wanted Harry Potter to be friends with him.“I am not asking for understanding or sorrow,” said the dark silhouette, still with that deadly calm. “But I have just spent two full hours inthe presence of Hermione Granger, dressed in such clothing as was provided me, visiting such fascinating places in Hogwarts as a tiny burblingwaterfall of what looked to me like snot, accompanied by a number ofother girls who insisted on such helpful activities as strewing our pathwith Transfigured rose petals. I have been on a date, scion of Malfoy. Myfirst date. And when I call that favor due, you will pay it.”Draco nodded solemnly. Before arriving he had taken the wise precaution of learning every available detail of Harry’s date, so that he couldget all of his hysterical laughing done before their appointed meetingtime, and would not commit a faux pas by giggling continuously until helost consciousness.“Do you think,” Draco said, “that something sad ought to happen tothe Granger girl—”“Spread the word in Slytherin that the Granger girl is mine and anyonewho meddles in my affairs will have their remains scattered over an areawide enough to include twelve different spoken languages. And since Iam not in Gryffindor and I use cunning rather than immediate frontalattacks, they should not panic if I am seen smiling at her.”“Or if you’re seen on a second date?” Draco said, allowing just a tinynote of skepticism into his voice.“There will be no second date,” said the green-lit silhouette in a voice sofearsome that it sounded, not only like a Death Eater, but like AmycusCarrow that one time just before Father told him to stop it, he wasn’t theDark Lord.Of course it was still a young boy’s high unbroken voice and when youcombined that with the actual words, well, it just didn’t work. If Harry Pot*328 *ter did become the next Dark Lord someday, Draco would use a Pensieveto store a copy of this memory somewhere safe, and Harry Potter wouldnever dare betray him.“But let us talk of happier matters,” said the green-shadowed figure.“Let us talk of knowledge and of power. Draco Malfoy, let us talk of Science.”“Yes,” said Draco. “Let us speak.”Draco wondered how much of his own face could be seen, and howmuch was in shadow, in that eerie green light.And though Draco kept his face serious, there was a smile in his heart.He was finally having a real grownup conversation.“I offer you power,” said the shadowy figure, “and I will tell you of thatpower and its price. The power comes from knowing the shape of realityand so gaining control over it. What you understand, you can command,and that is power enough to walk upon the Moon. The price of that poweris that you must learn to ask questions of Nature, and far more difficult,accept Nature’s answers. You will do experiments, perform tests and seewhat happens. And you must accept the meaning of those results whenthey tell you that you are mistaken. You will have to learn how to lose, notto me, but to Nature. When you find yourself arguing with reality, youwill have to let reality win. You will find this painful, Draco Malfoy, andI do not know if you are strong in that way. Knowing the price, is it stillyour wish to learn the human power?”Draco took a deep breath. He’d thought about this. And it was hard tosee how he could answer any other way. He’d been instructed to take every avenue of friendship with Harry Potter. It was just learning, he wasn’tpromising to do anything. He could always stop the lessons at any time…There were certainly any number of things about the situation whichmade it look like a trap, but in all honesty, Draco didn’t see how this couldgo wrong.Plus Draco did kind of want to rule the world.“Yes,” said Draco.“Excellent,” said the shadowy figure. “I have had something of acrowded week, and it will take time to plan your curriculum—”329 *“I’ve got a lot of things I need to do myself to consolidate my powerin Slytherin,” said Draco, “not to mention homework. Maybe we shouldjust start in October?”“Sounds sensible,” said the shadowy figure, “but what I meant to sayis that to plan your curriculum, I need to know what I will be teachingyou. Three thoughts come to me. The first is that I teach you of the human mind and brain. The second option is that I teach you of the physicaluniverse, those arts which lie on the pathway to visiting the Moon. Thisinvolves a great deal of numbers, but to a certain kind of mind those numbers are more beautiful than anything else Science has to teach. Do youlike numbers, Draco?”Draco shook his head.“Then so much for that. You will learn your mathematics eventually,but not right away, I think. The third option is that I teach you of geneticsand evolution and inheritance, what you would call blood—”“That one,” said Draco.The figure nodded. “I thought you might say as much. But I thinkit will be the most painful path for you, Draco. What if your family andfriends, the blood purists, say one thing, and you find that the experimental test says another?”“Then I’ll figure out how to make the experimental test say the rightanswer!”There was a pause, as the shadowy figure stood there with its mouthopen for a short while.“Um,” said the shadowy figure. “It doesn’t really work like that. That’swhat I was trying to warn you about here, Draco. You can’t make the answer come out to be anything you like.”“You can always make the answer come out your way,” said Draco.That had been practically the first thing his tutors had taught him. “It’sjust a matter of finding the right arguments.”“No,” said the shadowy figure, voice rising in frustration, “no, no, no!Then you get the wrong answer and you can’t go to the Moon that way! Nature isn’t a person, you can’t trick them into believing something else, ifyou try to tell the Moon it’s made of cheese you can argue for days and itwon’t change the Moon! What you’re talking about is rationalization, like330 *starting with a sheet of paper, moving straight down to the bottom line,using ink to write ‘and therefore, the Moon is made of cheese’, and thenmoving back up to write all sorts of clever arguments above. But eitherthe Moon is made of cheese or it isn’t. The moment you wrote the bottomline, it was already true or already false. Whether or not the whole sheet ofpaper ends up with the right conclusion or the wrong conclusion is fixedthe instant you write down the bottom line. If you’re trying to pick between two expensive trunks, and you like the shiny one, it doesn’t matterwhat clever arguments you come up with for buying it, the real rule youused to choose which trunk to argue for was ‘pick the shiny one’, and howevereffective that rule is at picking good trunks, that’s the kind of trunk you’llget. Rationality can’t be used to argue for a fixed side, its only possible useis deciding which side to argue. Science isn’t for convincing anyone that theblood purists are right. That’s politics! The power of science comes fromfinding out the way Nature really is that can’t be changed by arguing! What science can do is tell us how blood really works, how wizards really inherit theirpowers from their parents, and whether Muggleborns are really weakeror stronger—”“Stronger!” said Draco. He had been trying to follow this, a puzzledfrown on his face, he could see how it sort of made sense but it certainlywasn’t like anything he’d ever heard before. And then Harry Potter hadsaid something Draco couldn’t possibly let pass. “You think mudbloodsare stronger?”“I think nothing,” said the shadowy figure. “I know nothing. I believenothing. My bottom line is not yet written. I will figure out how to testthe magical strength of Muggleborns, and the magical strength of purebloods. If my tests tell me that Muggleborns are weaker, I will believethey are weaker. If my tests tell me that Muggleborns are stronger, I willbelieve they are stronger. Knowing this and other truths, I will gain somemeasure of power—”“And you expect me to believe whatever you say?” Draco demandedhotly.“I expect you to perform the tests personally,” said the shadowy figurequietly. “Are you afraid of what you will find?”Draco stared at the shadowy figure for a while, his eyes narrowed.“Nice trap, Harry,” he said. “I’ll have to remember that one, it’s new.”The shadowy figure shook his head. “It’s not a trap, Draco. Remember—I don’t know what we’ll find. But you do not understand the universe byarguing with it or telling it to come back with a different answer nexttime. When you put on the robes of a scientist you must forget all yourpolitics and arguments and factions and sides, silence the desperateclingings of your mind, and wish only to hear the answer of Nature.”The shadowy figure paused. “Most people can’t do it. That’s why this isdifficult. Are you sure you wouldn’t rather just learn about the brain?”“And if I tell you I’d rather learn about the brain,” Draco said, his voicenow hard, “you’ll go around telling people that I was afraid of what I’dfind.”“No,” said the shadowy figure. “I will do no such thing.”“But you might do the same sort of tests yourself, and if you got thewrong answer, I wouldn’t be there to say anything before you showed itto someone else.” Draco’s voice was still hard.“I would still ask you first, Draco,” the shadowy figure said quietly.Draco paused. He hadn’t been expecting that, he’d thought he sawthe trap but… “You would?”“Of course. How would I know who to blackmail or what we could askfrom them? Draco, I say again that this is not a trap I set for you. At leastnot for you personally. If your politics were different, I would be saying,what if the test shows that purebloods are stronger.”“Really.”“Yes! That’s the price anyone has to pay to become a scientist!”Draco held up a hand. He had to think.The shadowy, green-lit figure waited.It didn’t take long to think about, though. If you discarded all the confusing parts… then Harry Potter was planning to mess around with something that could cause a gigantic political explosion, and it would be insane to just walk away and let him do it on his own. “We’ll study blood,”said Draco.“Excellent,” said the figure, and smiled. “Congratulations on beingwilling to ask the question.”332 *“Thanks,” Draco said, not quite managing to keep the irony out of hisvoice.“Hey, did you think going to the Moon was easy? Be glad this just involves changing your mind sometimes, and not a human sacrifice!”“Human sacrifice would be way easier!”There was a slight pause, and then the figure nodded. “Fair point.”“Look, Harry,” said Draco without much hope, “I thought the idea wasto take all the things that Muggles know, combine them with things thatwizards know, and become masters of both worlds. Wouldn’t it be a loteasier to just study all the things that Muggles already found out, like theMoon stuff, and use that power—”“No,” said the figure with a sharp shake of his head, sending greenshadows moving around his nose and eyes. His voice had turned verygrim. “If you cannot learn the scientist’s art of accepting reality, then Imust not tell you what that acceptance has discovered. It would be likea powerful wizard telling you of those gates which must not be opened,and those seals which must not be broken, before you had proven yourintelligence and discipline by surviving the lesser perils.”A chill went down Draco’s spine and he shuddered involuntarily. Heknew it had been visible even in the dim light. “All right,” said Draco. “Iunderstand.” Father had told him that many times. When a more powerful wizard told you that you weren’t ready to know, you didn’t pry anyfurther if you wanted to live.The figure inclined his head. “Indeed. But there is something else youshould understand. The first scientists, being Muggles, lacked your traditions. In the beginning they simply did not comprehend the notion ofdangerous knowledge, and thought that all things known should be spoken freely. When their searches turned dangerous, they told their politicians of things that should have stayed secret—don’t look like that, Draco,it wasn’t simple stupidity. They did have to be smart enough to uncoverthe secret in the first place. But they were Muggles, it was the first timethey’d found anything really dangerous, and they didn’t start out with a tradition of secrecy. There was a war going on, and the scientists on one sideworried that if they didn’t talk, the scientists of the enemy country wouldtell their politicians first…” The voice trailed off significantly. “They didn’t333 *destroy the world. But it was close. And we are not going to repeat thatmistake.”“Right,” Draco said, his voice now very firm. “We won’t. We’re wizards, and studying science doesn’t make us Muggles.”“As you say,” said the green-lit silhouette. “We will establish our ownScience, a magical Science, and that Science will have smarter traditionsfrom the very start.” The voice grew hard. “The knowledge I share withyou will be taught alongside the disciplines of accepting truth, the levelof this knowledge will be keyed to your progress in those disciplines, andyou will share that knowledge with no one else who has not learned thosedisciplines. Do you accept this?”“Yes,” said Draco. What was he supposed to do, say no?“Good. And what you discover for yourself, you will keep to yourselfunless you think that other scientists are ready to know it. What we doshare among ourselves, we will not tell the world unless we agree it is safefor the world to know. And whatever our own politics and allegiances, wewill all punish any of our number who reveal dangerous magics or giveaway dangerous weapons, no matter what sort of war is going on. Fromthis day onward, that will be the tradition and the law of science amongwizards. Are we agreed on that?”“Yes,” said Draco. Actually this was starting to sound pretty attractive.The Death Eaters had tried to take power by being scarier than everyoneelse, and they hadn’t actually won yet. Maybe it was time to try rulingusing secrets instead. “And our group stays hidden for as long as possible,and everyone in it has to agree to our rules.”“Of course. Definitely.”There was a very short pause.“We’re going to need better robes,” said the shadowy figure, “withhoods and so on—”“I was just thinking that,” said Draco. “We don’t need whole new robes,though, just cowled cloaks to put on. I have a friend in Slytherin, she’lltake your measurements—”“Don’t tell her what it’s for, though—”“I’m not stupid!”334 *“And no masks for now, not when it’s just you and me—” said the shadowy figure.“Right! But later on we should have some sort of special mark that allour servants have, the Mark of Science, like a snake eating the Moon ontheir right arms—”“It’s called a PhD and wouldn’t that make it too easy to identify ourpeople?”“Huh?”“I mean, what if someone is like ‘okay, now everyone pull up theirrobes over their right arms’ and our guy is like ‘whoops, sorry, looks likeI’m a spy’—”“Forget I said anything,” said Draco, sweat suddenly springing out allover his body. He needed a distraction, fast—“And what do we call ourselves? The Science Eaters?”“No,” said the shadowy figure slowly. “That doesn’t sound right…”Draco wiped his robed arm across his forehead, wiping away beadsof moisture. What had the Dark Lord been thinking? Father had said theDark Lord was smart!“I’ve got it!” said the shadowy figure suddenly. “You won’t understand yet, but trust me, it fits.”Right now Draco would have accepted ‘Malfoy Munchers’ as long asit changed the subject. “What is it?”And standing amid the dusty desks in an unused classroom in thedungeons of Hogwarts, the green-lit silhouette of Harry Potter spreadhis arms dramatically and said, “This day shall mark the dawn of… theBayesian Conspiracy.”A silent figure trudged wearily through the halls of Hogwarts in the direction of Ravenclaw.Harry had gone straight from the meeting with Draco to dinner, andstayed at dinner barely long enough to choke down a few fast gulps offood before going off to bed.335 *It wasn’t even 7pm yet, but it was well past bedtime for Harry. He’drealized last night that he wouldn’t be able to use the Time-Turner onSaturday until after the book-reading contest was already over. But hecould still use the Time-Turner on Friday night, and gain time that way.So Harry had pushed himself to stay awake until 9pm on Friday, when theprotective shell opened, and then used the four hours remaining on theTime-Turner to spin back to 5pm and collapse into sleep. He’d woken uparound 2am on Saturday morning, just as planned, and read for the nexttwelve hours straight… and it still hadn’t been enough. And now Harrywould be going to sleep rather early for the next few days, until his sleepcycle caught up again.The portrait on the door asked Harry some dumb riddle meantfor eleven-year-olds that he answered without the words even passingthrough his conscious mind, and then Harry staggered up the stairs tohis dorm room, changed into his pajamas and collapsed into bed.And found that his pillow seemed rather lumpy.Harry groaned. He sat up reluctantly, twisted in bed, and lifted up hispillow.This revealed a note, two golden Galleons, and a book titled Occlumency: The Hidden Arte.Harry picked up the note and read:My, you do get yourself into trouble and quickly. Your father was nomatch for you.You have made a powerful enemy. Snape commands the loyalty, admiration, and fear of all House Slytherin. You cannot trust any of thatHouse now, whether they come to you in friendly guise or fearsome.From now on you must not meet Snape’s eyes. He is a Legilimens andcan read your mind if you do. I have enclosed a book which may help youlearn to protect yourself, though there is only so far you can get without atutor. Still you may hope to at least detect intrusion.So that you may find some extra time in which to study Occlumency,I have enclosed 2 Galleons, which is the price of answer sheets and homework for the first-year History of Magic class (Professor Binns havinggiven the same tests and same assignments every year since he died).336 *Your newfound friends the Weasley twins should be able to sell you acopy. It goes without saying that you must not get caught with it in yourpossession.Of Professor Quirrell I know little. He is a Slytherin and a DefenseProfessor, and that is two marks against him. Consider carefully any advice he gives you, and tell him nothing you do not wish known.Dumbledore only pretends to be insane. He is extremely intelligent,and if you continue to step into closets and vanish, he will certainly deduce your possession of an invisibility cloak if he has not done so already.Avoid him whenever possible, hide the Cloak of Invisibility somewheresafe (NOT your pouch) any time you cannot avoid him, and step withgreat care in his presence.Please be more careful in the future, Harry Potter.—Santa ClausHarry stared at the note.It did seem to be pretty good advice. Of course Harry wasn’t going tocheat in History class even if they gave him a dead monkey for a professor. But Severus’s Legilimency… whoever’d sent this note knew a lot ofimportant, secret things and was willing to tell Harry about them. Thenote was still warning him against Dumbledore stealing the Cloak but atthis point Harry honestly had no clue if that was a bad sign, it could justbe an understandable mistake.There seemed to be some sort of intrigue going on inside Hogwarts.Maybe if Harry compared stories between Dumbledore and the notesender, he could work out a combined picture that would be accurate?Like if they both agreed on something, then……whatever…Harry stuffed everything into his pouch and turned up the Quieterand pulled the cover over his head and died.337 *It was Sunday morning and Harry was eating pancakes in the Great Hall,sharp quick bites, glancing nervously at his watch every few seconds.It was 8:02am, and in precisely two hours and one minute, it would beexactly one week since he’d seen the Weasleys and crossed over onto Platform Nine and Three-Quarters.And the thought had occurred to him… Harry didn’t know if this was avalid way to think about the universe, he didn’t know anything any more,but it seemed possible…That…Not enough interesting things had happened to him over the last week.When he was done eating breakfast, Harry planned to go straight upto his room and hide in the bottom level of his trunk and not talk to anyone until 10:03am.And that was when Harry saw the Weasley twins walking toward him.One of them was carrying something concealed behind his back.He should scream and run away.He should scream and run away.Whatever this was… it could very well be……the grand finale…He really should just scream and run away.With a resigned feeling that the universe would come and get himanyway, Harry continued slicing at the pancake with his fork and knife.He couldn’t muster the energy. That was the sad truth. Harry knew nowhow people felt when they were tired of running, tired of trying to escapefate, and they just fell to the ground and let the horrifically befanged andtentacled demons of the darkest abyss drag them off to their unspeakabledestiny.The Weasley twins drew closer.And yet closer.Harry ate another bite of pancake.The Weasley twins arrived, grinning brightly.“Hello, Fred,” Harry said dully. One of the twins nodded. “Hello,George.” The other twin nodded.“You sound tired,” said George.“You should cheer up,” said Fred.338 *“Look what we got you!”And George took, from behind Fred’s back—A cake with twelve flaming candles.There was a pause, as the Ravenclaw table stared at them.“That’s not right,” said someone. “Harry Potter was born on the thirtyfirst of Jul—”“He is coming,” said a huge hollow voice that cut through all conversation like a sword of ice. “The one who will tear apart the very—”Dumbledore had leapt out of his throne and run straight over theHead Table and seized hold of the woman speaking those awful words,Fawkes had appeared in a flash, and all three of them vanished in a crackof fire.There was a shocked pause……followed by heads turning in the direction of Harry Potter.“I didn’t do it,” Harry said in a tired voice.“That was a prophecy!” someone at the table hissed. “And I bet it’sabout you!”Harry sighed.He stood up from his seat, raised his voice, and said very loudly overthe conversations that were starting up, “It’s not about me! Obviously! I’mnot coming here, I’m already here!”Harry sat back down again.The people who had been looking at him turned away again.Someone else at the table said, “Then who is it about?”And with a dull, leaden sensation, Harry realized who wasn’t alreadyat Hogwarts.Call it a wild guess, but Harry had a feeling the undead Dark Lordwould be showing up one of these days.The conversation continued on around him.“Not to mention, tear apart the very what?”“I thought I heard Trelawney start to say something with an ‘S’ justbefore the Headmaster grabbed her.”“Like… soul? Sun?”“If someone’s going to tear apart the Sun we’re really in trouble!”339 *That seemed rather unlikely to Harry, unless the world containedscary things which had heard of David Criswell’s ideas about star lifting.“So,” Harry said in tired tones, “this happens every Sunday breakfast,does it?”“No,” said a student who might have been in his seventh year, frowning grimly. “It doesn’t.”Harry shrugged. “Whatever. Anyone want some birthday cake?”“But it’s not your birthday!” said the same student who’d objected lasttime.That was the cue for Fred and George to start laughing, of course.Even Harry managed a weary smile.As the first slice was served to him, Harry said, “I’ve had a really longweek.”And Harry was sitting in the cavern level of his trunk, slid shut and lockedso no one could get in, a blanket pulled over his head, waiting for the weekto be over.10:01.10:02.10:03, but just to be sure…10:04 and the first week was done.Harry breathed a sigh of relief, and gingerly pulled the blanket off ofhis head.A few moments later, he had emerged into the bright sunlit air of hisdorm.Shortly after, and he was in the Ravenclaw common room. A few people looked at him, but no one said anything or tried to talk to him.Harry found a nice wide writing desk, pulled back a comfortable chair,and sat down. From his pouch he drew a sheet of paper and a pencil.Mum and Dad had told Harry in no uncertain terms that while theyunderstood his enthusiasm for leaving home and getting away from hisparents, he was to write them every week without fail, just so that they knewhe was alive, unharmed, and not in prison.340 *Harry stared down at the blank sheet of paper. Let’s see…After leaving his parents at the train station, he’d……gotten acquainted with a boy raised by Darth Vader, become friendswith the three most infamous pranksters in Hogwarts, met Hermione,then there’d been the Incident with the Sorting Hat… Monday he’d beengiven a time machine to treat his sleep disorder, gotten a legendary invisibility cloak from an unknown benefactor, rescued seven Hufflepuffs bystaring down five scary older boys one of whom had threatened to breakhis finger, realized that he possessed a mysterious dark side, learnedto cast Frigideiro in Charms class, and gotten started on his rivalry withHermione… Tuesday had introduced Astronomy taught by Professor Aurora Sinistra who was nice, and History of Magic taught by a ghost whoought to be exorcised and replaced with a tape recorder… Wednesday,he’d been pronounced the Most Dangerous Student in the Classroom…Thursday, let’s not even think about Thursday… Friday, the Incident inPotions Class, followed by his blackmailing the Headmaster, followedby the Defense Professor having him beaten up in class, followed by theDefense Professor turning out to be the most awesome human beingwho still walked the face of the Earth… Saturday he’d lost a bet and goneon his first date and started redeeming Draco… and then this morningProfessor Trelawney’s unheard prophecy might or might not indicatethat an immortal Dark Lord was about to attack Hogwarts.Harry mentally organized his material, and started writing.Dear Mum and Dad:Hogwarts is lots of fun. I learned how to violate the Second Law ofThermodynamics in Charms class, and I met a girl named HermioneGranger who reads faster than I do.I’d better leave it at that.Your loving son,Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres.small study room, near but not in the Ravenclaw dorm, one of themany many unused rooms of Hogwarts. Gray stone the floors, redbrick the walls, dark stained wood the ceiling, four glowing glass globesset into the four walls of the room. A circular table that looked like a wideslab of black marble set on thick black marble legs for columns, but whichhad proved to be very light (weight and mass both) and wasn’t difficult topick up and move around if necessary. Two comfortably cushioned chairswhich had seemed at first to be locked to the floor in inconvenient places,but which would, the two of them had finally discovered, scoot around towhere you stood as soon as you leaned over in a posture that looked likeyou were about to sit down.There also seemed to be a number of bats flying around the room.That was where, future historians would one day record—if the wholeproject ever actually amounted to anything—the scientific study of magichad begun, with two young first-year Hogwarts students.Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, theorist.And Hermione Jean Granger, experimenter and test subject.Harry was doing better in classes now, at least the classes he considered interesting. He’d read more books, and not books for eleven-yearolds either. He’d practiced Transfiguration over and over during oneof his extra hours every day, taking the other hour for beginning Occlumency. He was taking the worthwhile classes seriously, not just turning inhis homework every day, but using his free time to learn more than wasrequired, to read other books beyond the given textbooks, looking to master the subject and not just memorize a few test answers, to excel. Youdidn’t see that much outside Ravenclaw. And now even within Ravenclaw,343 *his only remaining competitors were Padma Patil (whose parents camefrom a non-English-speaking culture and thus had raised her with an actual work ethic), Anthony Goldstein (out of a certain tiny ethnic groupthat won 25% of the Nobel Prizes), and of course, striding far above everyone like a Titan strolling through a pack of puppies, Hermione Granger.To run this particular experiment you needed the test subject to learnsixteen new spells, on their own, without help or correction. That meantthe test subject was Hermione. Period.It should be mentioned at this point that the bats flying around theroom were not glowing.Harry was having trouble accepting the implications of this.“Oogely boogely!” Hermione said again.Again, at the tip of Hermione’s wand, there was the abrupt, transitionless appearance of a bat. One moment, empty air. The next moment, bat.Its wings seemed to be already moving in the instant when it appeared.And it still wasn’t glowing.“Can I stop now?” said Hermione.“Are you sure,” Harry said through what seemed to be a block in histhroat, “that maybe with a bit more practice you couldn’t get it to glow?”He was violating the experimental procedure he’d written down beforehand, which was a sin, and he was violating it because he didn’t like theresults he was getting, which was a mortal sin, you could go to ScienceHell for that, but it didn’t seem to be mattering anyway.“What did you change this time?” Hermione said, sounding a littleweary.“The durations of the oo, eh, and ee sounds. It’s supposed to be 3 to 2to 2, not 3 to 1 to 1.”“Oogely boogely!” said Hermione.The bat materialized with only one wing and spun pathetically to thefloor, flopping around in a circle on the gray stone.“Now what is it really?” said Hermione.“3 to 2 to 1.”“Oogely boogely!”This time the bat didn’t have any wings at all and fell with a plop likea dead mouse.344 *“3 to 1 to 2.”And lo the bat did materialize and it did fly up at once toward the ceiling, healthy and glowing a bright green.Hermione nodded in satisfaction. “Okay, what next?”There was a long pause.“Seriously? You seriously have to say Oogely boogely with the duration ofthe oo, eh, and ee sounds having a ratio of 3 to 1 to 2, or the bat won’t glow?Why? Why? For the love of all that is sacred, why?”“Why not?”Thud. Thud. Thud.Harry had thought about the nature of magic for a while, and thendesigned a series of experiments based on the premise that virtually everything wizards believed about magic was wrong.You couldn’t really need to say ‘Wingardium Leviosa’ in exactly theright way in order to levitate something, because, come on, ‘WingardiumLeviosa’? The universe was going to check that you said ‘WingardiumLeviosa’ in exactly the right way and otherwise it wouldn’t make the quillfloat?No. Obviously no, once you thought about it seriously. Someone,quite possibly an actual preschool child, but at any rate some Englishspeaking magic user, who thought that ‘Wingardium Leviosa’ soundedall flyish and floaty, had originally spoken those words while casting thespell for the first time. And then told everyone else it was necessary.But (Harry had reasoned) it didn’t have to be that way, it wasn’t builtinto the universe, it was built into you.There was an old story passed down among scientists, a cautionarytale, the story of Blondlot and the N-Rays.Shortly after the discovery of X-Rays, an eminent French physicistnamed Prosper-Rene Blondlot—who had been first to measure the speedof radio waves and show that they propagated at the speed of light—had announced the discovery of an amazing new phenomenon, N-Rays,which would induce a faint brightening of a screen. You had to look hardto see it, but it was there. N-Rays had all sorts of interesting properties.They were bent by aluminium and could be focused by an aluminium345 *prism into striking a treated thread of cadmium sulfide, which wouldthen glow faintly in the dark…Soon dozens of other scientists had confirmed Blondlot’s results, especially in France.But there were still other scientists, in England and Germany, whosaid they weren’t quite sure they could see that faint glow.Blondlot had said they were probably setting up the machinerywrong.One day Blondlot had given a demonstration of N-Rays. The lightshad turned out, and his assistant had called off the brightening and darkening as Blondlot performed his manipulations.It had been a normal demonstration, all the results going as expected.Even though an American scientist named Robert Wood had quietlystolen the aluminium prism from the center of Blondlot’s mechanism.And that had been the end of N-Rays.Reality, Philip K. Dick had once said, is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn’t go away.Blondlot’s sin had been obvious in retrospect. He shouldn’t have toldhis assistant what he was doing. Blondlot should have made sure the assistant didn’t know what was being tried or when it was being tried, before asking him to describe the screen’s brightness. It could have beenthat simple.Nowadays it was called “blinding” and it was one of the things modernscientists took for granted. If you were doing a psychology experiment tosee whether people got angrier when they were hit over the head with redtruncheons than with green truncheons, you didn’t get to look at the subjects yourself and decide how “angry” they were. You would snap photosof them after they’d been hit with the truncheon, and send the photos offto a panel of raters, who would rate on a scale of 1 to 10 how angry eachperson looked, obviously without knowing what color of truncheon they’dbeen hit with. Indeed there was no good reason to tell the raters what theexperiment was about, at all. You certainly wouldn’t tell the experimentalsubjects that you thought they ought to be angrier when hit by red truncheons. You’d just offer them 20 pounds, lure them into a test room, hitthem with a truncheon, color randomly assigned of course, and snap the346 *photo. In fact the truncheon-hitting and photo-snapping would be doneby an assistant who hadn’t been told about the hypothesis, so he couldn’tlook expectant, hit harder, or snap the photo at just the right time.Blondlot had destroyed his reputation with the sort of mistake thatwould get a failing grade and probably derisive laughter from the T.A. ina first-year undergraduate course on experimental design… in 1991.But this had been a bit longer ago, in 1904, and so it had taken monthsbefore Robert Wood had formulated the obvious alternative hypothesisand figured out how to test it, and dozens of other scientists had beensucked in.More than two centuries after science had gotten started. That late inscientific history, it still hadn’t been obvious.Which made it entirely plausible that in the tiny wizarding world,where science didn’t seem much known at all, no one had ever tried thefirst, the simplest, the most obvious thing that any modern scientistwould think to check.The books were full of complicated instructions for all the things youhad to do exactly right in order to cast a spell. And, Harry had hypothesized, the process of obeying those instructions, of checking that youwere following them correctly, probably did do something. It forced you toconcentrate on the spell. Being told to just wave your wand and wish probably wouldn’t work as well. And once you believed the spell was supposedto work a certain way, once you had practiced it that way, you might notbe able to convince yourself that it could work any other way……if you did the simple but wrong thing, and tried to test alternativeforms yourself.But what if you didn’t know what the original spell had been like?What if you gave Hermione a list of spells she hadn’t studied yet, takenfrom a book of silly prank spells in the Hogwarts library, and some ofthose spells had the correct and original instructions, while others hadone changed gesture, one changed word? What if you kept the instructions constant, but told her that a spell supposed to create a red wormwas supposed to create a blue worm instead?Well, in that case, it had turned out……Harry was having trouble believing his results here…347 *…if you told Hermione to say “Oogely boogely” with the vowel durations in the ratio of 3 to 1 to 1, instead of the correct ratio of 3 to 1 to 2, youstill got the bat but it wouldn’t glow any more.Not that belief was irrelevant here. Not that only the words and wandmovements mattered.If you gave Hermione completely incorrect information about what aspell was supposed to do, it would stop working.If you didn’t tell her at all what the spell was supposed to do, it wouldstop working.If she knew in very vague terms what the spell was supposed to do,or she was only partially wrong, then the spell would work as originallydescribed in the book, not the way she’d been told it should.Harry was, at this moment, literally banging his head against thebrick wall. Not hard. He didn’t want to damage his precious brains. Butif he didn’t have some outlet for his frustration, he would spontaneouslycatch on fire.Thud. Thud. Thud.It seemed the universe actually did want you to say ‘WingardiumLeviosa’ and it wanted you to say it in a certain exact way and it didn’tcare what you thought the pronunciation should be any more than itcared how you felt about gravity.The worst part of it was the smug, amused look on Hermione’s face.Hermione had not been okay with sitting around obediently followingHarry’s instructions without being told why.So Harry had explained to her what they were testing.Harry had explained why they were testing it.Harry had explained why probably no wizard had tried it before them.Harry had explained that he was actually fairly confident of his prediction.Because, Harry had said, there was no way that the universe actuallywanted you to say ‘Wingardium Leviosa’.Hermione had pointed out that this was not what her books said. Hermione had asked if Harry really thought he was smarter, at eleven years348 *old and just over a month into his Hogwarts education, than all the otherwizards in the world who disagreed with him.Harry had said the following exact words:“Of course.”Now Harry was staring at the red brick directly in front of him andcontemplating how hard he would have to hit his head in order to givehimself a concussion that would interfere with long-term memory formation and prevent him from remembering this later. Hermione wasn’tlaughing, but he could feel her intent to laugh radiating out from behindhim like a dreadful pressure on his skin, sort of like knowing you werebeing stalked by a serial killer only worse.“Say it,” Harry said.“I wasn’t going to,” said the kindly voice of Hermione Granger. “Itdidn’t seem nice.”“Just get it over with,” said Harry.“Okay! So you gave me this whole long lecture about how hard it was todo basic science and how we might need to stay on the problem for thirtyfive years, and then you went and expected us to make the greatest discovery in the history of magic in the first hour we were working together.You didn’t just hope, you really expected it. You’re silly.”“Thank you. Now—”“I’ve read all the books you gave me and I still don’t know what to callthat. Overconfidence? Planning fallacy? Super duper Lake Wobegon effect? They’ll have to name it after you. Harry Bias.”“All right!”“But it is cute. It’s such a boy thing to do.”“Drop dead.”“Aw, you say the most romantic things.”Thud. Thud. Thud.“So what’s next?” said Hermione.Harry rested his head against the bricks. His forehead was starting tohurt where he’d been banging it. “Nothing. I have to go back and designdifferent experiments.”349 *Over the last month, Harry had carefully worked out, in advance, acourse of experimentation for them that would have lasted until December.It would have been a great set of experiments if the very first test hadnot falsified the basic premise.Harry could not believe he had been this dumb.“Let me correct myself,” said Harry. “I need to design one new experiment. I’ll let you know when we’ve got it, and we’ll do it, and then I’lldesign the next one. How does that sound?”“It sounds like someone wasted a whole lot of effort.”Thud. Ow. He’d done that a bit harder than he’d planned.“So,” said Hermione. She was leaning back in her chair and the smuglook was back on her face. “What did we discover today?”“I discovered,” said Harry through gritted teeth, “that when it comesto doing truly basic research on a genuinely confusing problem where youhave no clue what’s going on, my books on scientific methodology aren’tworth crap—”“Language, Mr. Potter! Some of us are innocent young girls!”“Fine. But if my books were worth a carp, that’s a kind of fish not anything bad, they would have given me the following important piece of advice: When there’s a confusing problem and you’re just starting out andyou have a falsifiable hypothesis, go test it. Find some simple, easy way ofdoing a basic check and do it right away. Don’t worry about designing anelaborate course of experiments that would make a grant proposal lookimpressive to a funding agency. Just check as fast as possible whetheryour ideas are false before you start investing huge amounts of effort inthem. How does that sound for a moral?”“Mmm… okay,” said Hermione. “But I was also hoping for somethinglike ‘Hermione’s books aren’t worthless. They’re written by wise old wizards who know way more about magic than I do. I should pay attentionto what Hermione’s books say.’ Can we have that moral too?”Harry’s jaw seemed to be clenched too tightly to let any words out, sohe just nodded.“Great!” Hermione said. “I liked this experiment. We learned a lotfrom it and it only took me an hour or so.”350 *In the dungeons of Slytherin.An unused classroom lit with eerie green light, much brighter thistime and coming from a small crystal globe with a temporary enchantment, but eerie green light nonetheless, casting strange shadows fromthe dusty desks.Two boy-sized figures in cowled grey cloaks (no masks) had enteredin silence, and sat down in two chairs opposite the same desk.It was the second meeting of the Bayesian Conspiracy.Draco Malfoy hadn’t been sure if he should look forward to it or not.Harry Potter, judging by the expression on his face, didn’t seem tohave any doubts on the appropriate mood.Harry Potter looked like he was ready to kill someone.“Hermione Granger,” said Harry Potter, just as Draco was openinghis mouth. “Don’t ask.”He couldn’t have gone on another date, could he? thought Draco, but thatdidn’t make any sense.“Harry,” said Draco, “I’m sorry but I have to ask this anyway, did youreally order the mudblood girl an expensive mokeskin pouch for her birthday?”“Yes, I did. You’ve already worked out why, of course.”Draco reached up and raked fingers through his hair in frustration,his cowl brushing the back of his hand. He hadn’t been quite sure why,but now he couldn’t say so. And Slytherin knew he was courting HarryPotter, he’d made it obvious enough in Defense class. “Harry,” said Draco,“people know I’m friends with you, they don’t know about the Conspiracyof course, but they know we’re friends, and it makes me look bad whenyou do that sort of thing.”Harry Potter’s face tightened. “Anyone in Slytherin who can’t understand the concept of acting nice toward people you don’t actually likeshould be ground up and fed to pet snakes.”“There are a lot of people in Slytherin who don’t,” Draco said, his voiceserious. “Most people are stupid, and you have to look good in front ofthem anyway.” Harry Potter had to understand that if he ever wanted toget anywhere in life.“What do you care what other people think? Are you really going tolive your life needing to explain everything you do to the dumbest idiotsin Slytherin, letting them judge you? I’m sorry, Draco, but I’m not lowering my cunning plots to the level of what the dumbest Slytherins can understand, just because it might make you look bad otherwise. Not evenyour friendship is worth that. It would take all the fun out of life. Tell me youhaven’t ever thought the same thing when someone in Slytherin is beingtoo stupid to breathe, that it’s beneath the dignity of a Malfoy to have topander to them.”Draco genuinely hadn’t. Ever. Pandering to idiots was like breathing,you did it without thinking about it.“Harry,” Draco said at last. “Just doing whatever you want, withoutworrying about how it looks, isn’t smart. The Dark Lord worried abouthow he looked! He was feared and hated, and he knew exactly what sortof fear and hate he wanted to create. Everyone has to worry about whatother people think.”The cowled figure shrugged. “Perhaps. Remind me sometime to tellyou about something called Asch’s Conformity Experiment, you mightfind it quite amusing. For now I’ll just note that it’s dangerous to worryabout what other people think on instinct, because you actually care, not asa matter of cold-blooded calculation. Remember, I was beaten and bullied by older Slytherins for fifteen minutes, and afterward I stood up andgraciously forgave them. Just like the good and virtuous Boy-Who-Livedought to do. But my cold-blooded calculations, Draco, tell me that I haveno use for the dumbest idiots in Slytherin, since I don’t own a pet snake. So Ihave no reason to care what they think about how I conduct my duel withHermione Granger.”Draco did not clench his fists in frustration. “She’s just some mudblood,” Draco said, keeping his voice calm, rather than shouting. “If youdon’t like her, push her down the stairs.”“Ravenclaw would know—”352 *“Have Pansy Parkinson push her down the stairs! You wouldn’t evenhave to manipulate her, offer her a Sickle and she’d do it!”“I would know! Hermione beat me in a book-reading contest, she’sgetting better grades than me, I have to defeat her with my brain or itdoesn’t count!”“She’s just a mudblood! Why do you respect her that much?”“She’s a power among Ravenclaws! Why do you care what some powerlessidiot in Slytherin thinks?”“It’s called politics! And if you can’t play it you can’t have power!”“Walking on the moon is power! Being a great wizard is power! There arekinds of power that don’t require me to spend the rest of my life pandering to morons!”Both of them stopped, and, in almost perfect unison, began takingdeep breaths to calm themselves.“Sorry,” Harry Potter said after a few moments, wiping sweat from hisforehead. “Sorry, Draco. You’ve got a lot of political power and it makessense for you to keep it. You should be calculating what Slytherin thinks.It’s an important game and I shouldn’t have insulted it. But you can’t askme to lower the level of my game in Ravenclaw, just so that you don’t lookbad by associating with me. Tell Slytherin you’re gritting your teeth whileyou pretend to be my friend.”That was exactly what Draco had told Slytherin, and he still wasn’tsure whether it was true.“Anyway,” Draco said. “Speaking of your image. I’m afraid I’ve gotsome bad news. Rita Skeeter heard some of the stories about you andshe’s been asking questions.”Harry Potter raised his eyebrows. “Who?”“She writes for the Daily Prophet,” Draco said. He tried to keep theworry out of his voice. The Daily Prophet was one of Father’s primary tools,he used it like a wizard’s wand. “That’s the newspaper people actually payattention to. Rita Skeeter writes about celebrities, and as she puts it, usesher quill to puncture their over-inflated reputations. If she can’t find anyrumors about you, she’ll just make up her own.”“I see,” said Harry Potter. His green-lit face looked very thoughtfulbeneath the cowl.353 *Draco hesitated before saying what he had to say next. By now someone had certainly reported to Father that he was courting Harry Potter,and Father would also know that Draco hadn’t written home about it, andFather would understand that Draco didn’t think he could actually keepit a secret, which sent a clear message that Draco was practicing his owngame now but still on Father’s side, since if Draco had been tempted away,he would have been sending false reports.It followed that Father had probably anticipated what Draco wasabout to say next.Playing the game with Father for real was a rather unnerving sensation. Even if they were on the same side. It was, on the one hand, exhiliarating, but Draco also knew that in the end it would turn out that Fatherhad played the game better. There was no other way it could possibly go.“Harry,” Draco finally said. “This isn’t a suggestion. This isn’t my advice. Just the way it is. My father could almost certainly quash that article.But it would cost you.”That Father had been expecting Draco to tell Harry Potter exactly thatwas not something Draco said out loud. Harry Potter would work it outon his own, or not.But instead Harry Potter shook his head, smiling beneath the cowl. “Ihave no intention of trying to quash Rita Skeeter.”Draco didn’t even try to keep the incredulity out of his voice. “Youcan’t tell me you don’t care what the newspaper says about you!”“I care less than you might think,” said Harry Potter. “But I have myown ways of dealing with the likes of Skeeter. I don’t need Lucius’s help.”A worried look came over Draco’s face before he could stop it. Whatever Harry Potter was about to do next, it would be something Fatherwasn’t expecting, and Draco was feeling very nervous about where thatmight lead.Draco also realized that his hair was getting sweaty underneath thecowl. He’d never actually worn one of those before, and hadn’t realizedthat the Death Eaters’ cloaks probably had things like Cooling Charms.Harry Potter wiped some sweat from his forehead again, grimaced,took out his wand, pointed it upward, took a deep breath, and said“Frigideiro!”354 *Moments later Draco felt the cold draft.“Frigideiro! Frigideiro! Frigideiro! Frigideiro! Frigideiro!”Then Harry Potter lowered the wand, though his hand seemed a bitshaky, and put it back into his robes.The whole room seemed perceptibly cooler. Draco could have donethat too, but still, not bad.“So,” Draco said. “Science. You’re going to tell me about blood.”“We’re going to find out about blood,” Harry Potter said. “By doingexperiments.”“All right,” Draco said. “What sort of experiments?”Harry Potter smiled evilly beneath his cowl, and said, “You tell me.”Draco had heard of something called the Socratic Method, which wasteaching by asking questions (named after an ancient philosopher whohad been too smart to be a real Muggle and hence had been a disguisedpureblood wizard). One of his tutors had used Socratic teaching a lot. Ithad been annoying but effective.Then there was the Potter Method, which was insane.To be fair, Draco had to admit that Harry Potter had tried the SocraticMethod first and it hadn’t been working too well.Harry Potter had asked how Draco would go about disproving theblood purist hypothesis that wizards couldn’t do the neat stuff nowthat they’d done eight centuries ago because they had interbred withMuggleborns and Squibs.Draco had said that he did not understand how Harry Potter could sitthere with a straight face and claim this was not a trap.Harry Potter had replied, still with a straight face, that if it was a trapit would have been so pathetically obvious that he ought to be ground upand fed to pet snakes, but it was not a trap, it was simply a rule of howscientists operated that you had to try to disprove your own theories, andif you made an honest effort and failed, that was victory.355 *Draco had tried to point out the staggering stupidity of this by suggesting that the key to surviving a duel was to cast Avada Kedavra on yourown foot and miss.Harry Potter had nodded.Draco had shaken his head.Harry Potter had then presented the idea that scientists watchedideas fight to see which ones won, and you couldn’t fight without an opponent, so Draco needed to figure out opponents for the blood puristhypothesis to fight so that blood purism could win, which Draco understood a little better even though Harry Potter had said it with a ratherdistasteful look. Like, it was clear that if blood purism was the way theworld really was, then the sky just had to be blue, and if some other theorywas true, the sky just had to be green; and nobody had seen the sky yet;and then you went outside and looked and the blood purists won; andafter this had happened six times in a row, people would start noticingthe trend.Harry Potter had then proceeded to claim that all the opponentsDraco was inventing were too weak, so blood purism wouldn’t get creditfor defeating them because the battle wouldn’t be impressive enough.Draco had understood that too. Wizards have gotten weaker because houseelves are stealing our magic hadn’t sounded impressive to him either.(Though Harry Potter had said that one at least was testable, in thatthey could try to check if house elves had gotten stronger over time, andeven draw a picture representing the increasing strength of house elvesand another picture representing the decreasing strength of wizards andif the two pictures matched that would point to the house elves, all saidin such completely serious tones that Draco had felt an impulse to askDobby a few pointed questions under Veritaserum before snapping outof it.)And Harry Potter had finally said that Draco couldn’t fix the battle, scientists weren’t dumb, it would be obvious if you fixed the battle, it hadto be a real fight, between two different theories that might both really betrue, with a test that only the true hypothesis would win, something thatactually would come out different ways depending on which hypothesiswas actually correct, and there would be experienced scientists watching356 *to make sure that was exactly what happened. Harry Potter had claimedthat he himself just wanted to know how blood really worked and for thathe need to see blood purism really win and Draco wasn’t going to fool himwith theories that were just there to be knocked down.Even having seen the point, Draco hadn’t been able to invent any“plausible alternatives”, as Harry Potter put it, to the idea that wizardswere getting less powerful because they were mixing their blood withmud. It was too obviously true.It was then that Harry Potter had said, rather frustrated, that hecouldn’t imagine Draco was really this bad at considering differentviewpoints, surely there’d been Death Eaters who’d posed as enemiesof blood purism and had come up with much more plausible-soundingarguments against their own side than Draco was offering. If Dracohad been trying to pose as a member of Dumbledore’s faction, and comeup with the house elf hypothesis, he wouldn’t have fooled anyone for asecond.Draco had been forced to admit this was a point.Hence the Potter Method.“Please, Dr. Malfoy,” whined Harry Potter, “why won’t you accept mypaper?”Harry Potter had needed to repeat the phrase “just pretend to be pretending to be a scientist” three times before Draco had understood.In that moment Draco had realized that there was something deeplywrong with Harry Potter’s brain, and anyone who tried Legilimency on itwould probably never come back out again.Harry Potter had then gone into further and considerable detail:Draco was to pretend to be a Death Eater who was posing as the editorof a scientific journal, Dr. Malfoy, who wanted to reject his enemy Dr.Potter’s paper “On the Heritability of Magical Ability”, and if the DeathEater didn’t act like a real scientist would, he would be revealed as aDeath Eater and executed, while Dr. Malfoy was also being watchedby his own rivals and needed to appear to reject Dr. Potter’s paper forneutral scientific reasons or he would lose his position as journal editor.It was a wonder the Sorting Hat wasn’t gibbering madly in St.Mungo’s.357 *It was also the most complicated thing anyone had ever asked Dracoto pretend and there was no possible way he could have refused the challenge.Right now they were, as Harry Potter had put it, getting in the mood.“I’m afraid, Dr. Potter, that you wrote this in the wrong color of ink,”Draco said. “Next!”Dr. Potter’s face did an excellent job of crumpling in despair, andDraco couldn’t help but feel a flash of Dr. Malfoy’s glee, even though theDeath Eater was only pretending to be Dr. Malfoy.This part was fun. He could have done this all day long.Dr. Potter got up from the chair, slumped over in dismay, andtrudged off, and turned into Harry Potter, who gave Draco a thumbs-up,and then turned back into Dr. Potter again, now approaching with aneager smile.Dr. Potter sat down and presented Dr. Malfoy with a piece of parchment on which was written:On the Heritability of Magical AbilityDr. H. J. Potter-Evans-Verres, Institute for Sufficiently Advanced ScienceMy observation:Today’s wizards can’t do things as impressive aswhat wizards used to do 800 years ago.My conclusion:Wizardkind has become weaker by mixingtheir blood with Muggleborns and Squibs.“Dr. Malfoy,” said Dr. Potter with a hopeful look, “I was wondering ifthe Journal of Irreproducible Results could consider for publication my paperentitled ‘On the Heritability of Magical Ability’.”Draco looked at the parchment, smiling while he considered possiblerejections. If he was a professor, he would have refused the essay as tooshort, so—“It’s too long, Dr. Potter,” said Dr. Malfoy.358 *For a moment there was genuine incredulity on Dr. Potter’s face.“Ah…” said Dr. Potter. “How about if I get rid of the separate lines forobservations and conclusions, and just put in a therefore—”“Then it’ll be too short. Next!”Dr. Potter trudged off.“All right,” said Harry Potter, “you’re getting too good at this. Twomore times to practice, and then third time is for real, no interruptionsbetween, I’ll just come in straight at you and that time you’ll reject thepaper based on the actual content, remember, your scientific rivals arewatching.”Dr. Potter’s next paper was perfect in every way, a marvel of its kind,but unfortunately had to be rejected because Dr. Malfoy’s journal washaving trouble with the letter E. Dr. Potter offered to rewrite it withoutthose words, and Dr. Malfoy explained that it was really more of a vowelproblem.The paper after that was rejected because it was Tuesday.It was, in fact, Saturday.Dr. Potter tried to point this out and was told “Next!”(Draco was starting to understand why Snape had used his hold overDumbledore just to get a position that let him be awful to students.)And then—Dr. Potter was approaching with a superior smirk on his face.“This is my latest paper, On the Heritability of Magical Ability,” Dr. Potter stated confidently, and thrust out the parchment. “I have decided to allow your journal to publish it, and have prepared it in perfect accordancewith your guidelines so that you may publish it quickly.”The Death Eater decided to track down and kill Dr. Potter after hismission was done. Dr. Malfoy kept a polite smile on his face, since hisrivals were watching, and said…(The pause stretched, with Dr. Potter looking at him impatiently.)…“Let me look at that, please.”Dr. Malfoy took the parchment and perused it carefully.The Death Eater was starting to get nervous about the fact that hewasn’t a real scientist, and Draco was trying to remember how to talk likeHarry Potter.359 *“You, ah, need to consider other possible explanations for your, um,observation, besides just this one—”“Really?” interrupted Dr. Potter. “Like what, exactly? House elves arestealing our magic? My data admit of only one possible conclusion, Dr. Malfoy. There are no other plausible hypotheses.”Draco was trying furiously to order his brain to think, what wouldhe say if he was posing as a member of Dumbledore’s faction, what didthey claim was the explanation for wizardkind’s decline, Draco had neverbothered to actually ask that…“If you can’t think of any other way to explain my data, you’ll have topublish my paper, Dr. Malfoy.”It was the sneer on Dr. Potter’s face that did it.“Oh yeah?” snapped Dr. Malfoy. “How do you know that magic itselfisn’t fading away?”Time stopped.Draco and Harry Potter exchanged looks of appalled horror.Then Harry Potter spat something that was probably an extremelybad word if you’d been raised by Muggles. “I didn’t think of that!” saidHarry Potter. “And I should have. The magic goes away. Damn, damn,damn!”The alarm in Harry Potter’s voice was contagious. Without eventhinking about it, Draco’s hand went into his robes and clutched at hiswand. He’d thought the House of Malfoy was safe, so long as you onlymarried into families that could trace their bloodlines back four generations you were supposed to be safe, it had never occurred to him beforethat there might be nothing anyone could do to stop the end of magic.“Harry, what do we do?” Draco’s voice was rising in panic. “What do wedo?”“Let me think!”After a few moments, Harry grabbed from a nearby desk the samequill and roll of parchment he’d used to write his pretend paper, andstarted scribbling something.“We’ll figure it out,” Harry said, his voice tight, “if magic is fading outof the world we’ll figure out how fast it’s fading and how much time wehave left to do something, and then we’ll figure out why it’s fading, and360 *then we’ll do something about it. Draco, have wizarding powers beendeclining at a steady rate, or have there been sudden drops?”“I… I don’t know…”“You told me that no one had matched the four founders of Hogwarts.So it’s been going on for at least eight centuries, then? You can’t remember hearing anything about the problems suddenly appearing five centuries ago or anything like that?”Draco was trying frantically to think. “I always heard that nobody wasas good as Merlin and then after that nobody was as good as the Foundersof Hogwarts.”“All right,” Harry said. He was still scribbling. “Because three centuries ago is when Muggles started to not believe in magic, which Ithought might have something to do with it. And about a century and ahalf ago was when Muggles began using a kind of technology that stopsworking around magic and I was wondering if it might also go the otherway around.”Draco exploded out of his chair, so angry he could hardly even speak.“It’s the Muggles—”“Damn it!” roared Harry. “Weren’t you even listening to yourself? It’sbeen going on for eight centuries at least and the Muggles weren’t doinganything interesting then! We have to figure out the real truth! The Mugglesmight have something to do with this but if they don’t and you go blamingeverything on them and that stops us from figuring out what’s really going on then one day you’re going to wake up in the morning and find outthat your wand is just a stick of wood!”Draco’s breath stopped in his throat. His father often said our wandswill break in our hands in his speeches but Draco had never really thoughtbefore about what that meant, it wasn’t going to happen to him after all.And now suddenly it seemed very real. Just a stick of wood. Draco couldimagine just what it would be like to take out his wand and try to cast aspell and find that nothing was happening…That could happen to everyone.There would be no more wizards, no more magic, ever. Just Muggleswho had a few legends about what their ancestors had been able to do.Some of the Muggles would be called Malfoy, and that would be all thatwas left of the name.For the first time in his life, Draco realized why there were DeathEaters.He’d always taken for granted that becoming a Death Eater was something you did when you grew up. Now Draco understood, he knew whyFather and Father’s friends had sworn to give their lives to prevent thenightmare from coming to pass, there were things you couldn’t just standby and watch happen. But what if it was going to happen anyway, whatif all the sacrifices, all the friends they’d lost to Dumbledore, the familythey’d lost, what if it had all been for nothing…“Magic can’t be fading away,” Draco said. His voice was breaking. “Itwouldn’t be fair.”Harry stopped scribbling and looked up. His face had an angry expression. “Your father never told you that life isn’t fair?”Father had said that every single time Draco used the word. “But, but,it’s too awful to believe that—”“Draco, let me introduce you to something I call the Litany of Tarski.It changes every time you use it. On this occasion it runs like so: If magicis fading out of the world, I want to believe that magic is fading out of the world.If magic is not fading out of the world, I want not to believe that magic is fadingout of the world. Let me not become attached to beliefs I may not want. If we’reliving in a world where magic is fading, that’s what we have to believe, wehave to know what’s coming, so we can stop it, or in the very worst case,be prepared to do what we can in the time we have left. Not believingit won’t stop it from happening. So the only question we have to ask iswhether magic is actually fading, and if that’s the world we live in thenthat’s what we want to believe. Litany of Gendlin: What’s true is already so,owning up to it doesn’t make it worse. Got that, Draco? I’m going to makeyou memorize it later. It’s something you repeat to yourself any time youstart wondering if it’s a good idea to believe something that isn’t actuallytrue. In fact I want you to say it right now. What’s true is already so, owningup to it doesn’t make it worse. Say it.”“What’s true is already so,” repeated Draco, his voice trembling, “owning up to it doesn’t make it worse.”362 *“If magic is fading, I want to believe that magic is fading. If magic isnot fading, I want not to believe that magic is fading. Say it.”Draco repeated back the words, the sickness churning in his stomach.“Good,” Harry said, “remember, it might not be happening, and thenyou won’t have to believe it, either. First we just want to know what’s actually going on, which world we actually live in.” Harry turned back tohis work, scribbled some more, and then turned the parchment so Dracocould see it. Draco leaned over the desk and Harry brought the green lightcloser.Observation:Wizardry isn’t as powerful now as it was when Hogwarts was founded.Hypotheses:1. Magic itself is fading.2. Wizards are interbreeding with Muggles and Squibs.3. Knowledge to cast powerful spells is being lost.4. Wizards are eating the wrong foods as children, or something else besides bloodis making them grow up weaker.5. Muggle technology is interfering with magic. (Since 800 years ago?)6. Stronger wizards are having fewer children. (Draco = only child? Check if 3powerful wizards, Quirrell / Dumbledore / Dark Lord, had any children.)Tests:“All right,” Harry said. His breathing sounded a little calmer. “Nowwhen you’re dealing with a confusing problem and you have no ideawhat’s going on, the smart thing to do is figure out some really simpletests, things you can look at right away. We need fast tests that distinguish between these hypotheses. Observations that would come out adifferent way for at least one of them compared to all the other ones.”363 *Draco stared at the list in shock. He was suddenly realizing that heknew an awful lot of purebloods who were only children. Himself, Vincent, Gregory, practically everyone. The two most powerful wizards everyone talked about were Dumbledore and the Dark Lord and neither hadany children just like Harry had suspected…“It’s going to be really hard to distinguish between 2 and 6,” Harrysaid, “it’s in the blood either way, you’d have to try and track the declineof wizardry and compare that to how many kids different wizards werehaving and measure the abilities of Muggleborns compared to purebloods…” Harry’s fingers were tapping nervously on the desk. “Let’s justlump 6 in with 2 and call them the blood hypothesis for now. 4 is unlikelybecause then everyone would notice a sudden drop when the wizardsswitched to new foods, it’s hard to see what would’ve changed steadilyover 800 years. 5 is unlikely for the same reason, no sudden drop, Muggles weren’t doing anything 800 years back. 4 looks like 2 and 5 looks like1 anyway. So mainly we should be trying to distinguish between 1, 2, and3.” Harry turned the parchment to himself, drew an ellipse around thosethree numbers, turned it back. “Magic is fading, blood is weakening,knowledge is disappearing. What test comes out differently dependingon which of those is true? What could we see that would mean any oneof these was false?”“I don’t know!” blurted Draco. “Why are you asking me? You’re thescientist!”“Draco,” Harry said, a note of pleading desperation in his voice, “I onlyknow what Muggle scientists know! You grew up in the wizarding world,I didn’t! You know more magic than I do and you know more about magicthan I do and you thought of this whole idea in the first place, so startthinking like a scientist and solve this!”Draco swallowed hard and stared at the paper.Magic is fading… wizards are interbreeding with Muggles… knowledge is being lost…“What does the world look like if magic is fading?” said Harry Potter.“You know more about magic, you should be the one guessing not me!Imagine you’re telling a story about it, what happens in the story?”364 *Draco imagined it. “Charms that used to work stop working.” Wizardswake up and find that their wands are sticks of wood…“What does the world look like if the wizarding blood gets weaker?”“People can’t do things their ancestors could do.”“What does the world look like if knowledge is being lost?”“People don’t know how to cast the Charms in the first place…” saidDraco. He stopped, surprised at himself. “That’s a test, isn’t it?”Harry nodded decisively. “That’s one.” He wrote it down on the parchment under Tests:A. Are there spells we know but can’t cast (1 or 2) or are the lost spells no longerknown (3)?“So that distinguishes between 1 and 2 on the one hand, and 3 on theother hand,” said Harry. “Now we need some way to distinguish between1 and 2. Magic fading, blood weakening, how could we tell the difference?”“What kind of Charms did students used to cast in their first year atHogwarts?” said Draco. “If they used to be able to cast much more powerful Charms, the blood was stronger—”Harry Potter shook his head. “Or magic itself was stronger. We haveto figure out some way of telling the difference.” Harry stood up from hischair, began pacing nervously through the classroom. “No, wait, thatmight still work. Suppose different spells use up different amounts ofmagical energy. Then if the ambient magic weakened, the powerful spellswould die first, but the spells everyone learns in their first year wouldstay the same…” Harry’s nervous pacing sped up. “It’s not a very goodtest, it’s more about powerful wizardry being lost versus all wizardry being lost, someone’s blood could be too weak for powerful wizardry butstrong enough for easy spells… Draco, do you know if more powerful wizards within a single era, like powerful wizards from just this century, aremore powerful as children? If the Dark Lord had cast the Cooling Charmwhen he was eleven, could he have frozen the whole room?”Draco’s face screwed up as he tried to recollect. “I can’t rememberhearing anything about the Dark Lord but I think Dumbledore’s supposed to have done something amazing on his Transfiguration O.W.L.s365 *in fifth year… I think other powerful wizards were good in Hogwartstoo…”Harry scowled, still pacing. “They could just be studying hard. Still,if first-year students learned the same spells and seemed about as powerful then as now, we could call that weak evidence favoring 1 over 2… wait,hold on.” Harry stopped where he stood. “I have another test that mightdistinguish between 1 and 2. It would take a while to explain, it uses somethings that scientists know about blood and inheritance, but it’s an easyquestion to ask. And if we combine my test and your test and they bothcome out the same way, that’s a strong hint at the answer.” Harry almostran back to the desk, took the parchment and wrote:B. Did ancient first-year students cast the same sort of spells, with the samepower, as now? (Weak evidence for 1 over 2, but blood could also be losing powerfulwizardry only.)C. Additional test that distinguishes 1 and 2 using scientific knowledge ofblood, will explain later.“Okay,” said Harry, “we can at least try to tell the difference between1 and 2 and 3, so let’s go with this right away, we can figure out more testsafter we do the ones we already have. Now it’s going to look a little oddif Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter go around asking questions together,so here’s my idea. You’ll go through Hogwarts and find old portraits andask them about what spells they learned to cast during their first years.They’re portraits so they won’t know there’s anything odd about DracoMalfoy doing that. I’ll ask recent portraits and living people about spellswe know but can’t cast, no one will notice anything unusual if Harry Potter asks weird questions. And I’ll have to do complicated research aboutforgotten spells, so I want you to be the one to gather the data I need formy own scientific question. It’s a simple question and you should be ableto find the answer by asking portraits. You might want to write this down,ready?”Draco sat down again and scrabbled in his bookbag for parchmentand quill. When it was laid down on the desk, Draco looked up, face determined. “Go ahead.”“Find portraits who knew a married Squib couple—don’t make thatface, Draco, it’s important information. Just ask recent portraits who are366 *Gryffindors or something. Find portraits who knew a married Squib couple well enough to know the names of all their children. Write down thename of each child and whether that child was a wizard, a Squib, or a Muggle. If they don’t know whether the child was a Squib or a Muggle, writedown ‘non-wizard’. Write that down for every child the couple had, don’tleave any out. If the portrait only knows the name of the wizarding children, not the names of all the children, then don’t write down any datafrom that couple. It’s very important that you only bring me data fromsomeone who knows all the children a Squib couple had, well enough toknow them all by name. Try to get at least forty names total, if you can,and if you have time for more, even better. Have you got all that?”“Repeat it,” Draco said, when he was done writing, and Harry repeated it.“I’ve got it,” Draco said, “but why—”“It has to do with one of the secrets of blood that scientists alreadydiscovered. I’ll explain when you get back. Let’s split up and meet backhere in an hour, 6:22pm that should be. Are we ready to go?”Draco nodded decisively. It was all very rushed, but he’d long sincebeen taught how to rush.“Then go!” said Harry Potter and yanked off his cowled cloak andshoved it into his pouch, which began eating it, and, without even waitingfor his pouch to finish, spun around and began striding rapidly towardthe classroom door, bumping into a desk and almost falling over in hishaste.By the time Draco had managed to get his own cloak off and stow itin his bookbag, Harry Potter was gone.Draco almost ran out the door.367 *nd then Janet was a Squib,” said the portrait of a short young“A woman with a gold-trimmed hat.Draco wrote it down. That was only twenty-eight but it was time togo back and meet Harry.He’d needed to ask other portraits to help translating, English hadchanged a lot, but the oldest portraits had described first-year spells thatsounded an awful lot like the ones they had now. Draco had recognizedaround half of them and the other half didn’t sound any more powerful.The sick feeling in his stomach had grown with each answer until finally, unable to take it any more, he’d gone off and asked other portraitsHarry Potter’s strange question about Squib marriages, instead. The firstfive portraits hadn’t known anyone and finally he’d asked those portraitsto ask their acquaintances to ask their acquaintances and so managed tofind some people who’d actually admit to being friends with Squibs.(The first-year Slytherin had explained he was working on an important project with a Ravenclaw and the Ravenclaw had told him theyneeded this information and then run off without saying why. This hadgarnered many sympathetic looks.)Draco’s feet were heavy as he walked through the corridors of Hogwarts. He should have been running but he couldn’t seem to muster theenergy. He kept on thinking that he didn’t want to know about this, hedidn’t want to be involved in any of this, he didn’t want this to be his responsibility, just let Harry Potter do it, if magic was fading let Harry Potter take care of it…But Draco knew that wasn’t right.369 *Chill the dungeons of Slytherin, gray the stone walls, Draco usuallyliked the atmosphere, but now it seemed too much like fading.His hand on the doorknob, Harry Potter already inside and waiting,wearing his cowled cloak.“The ancient first-year spells,” Harry Potter said. “What did you find?”“They’re no more powerful than the spells we use now.”Harry Potter’s fist struck a desk, hard. “Damn it. All right. My ownexperiment was a failure, Draco. There’s something called the Interdictof Merlin—”Draco hit himself on the forehead, realizing.“—which stops anyone from getting knowledge of powerful spells outof books, even if you find and read a powerful wizard’s notes they won’tmake sense to you, it has to go from one living mind to another. I couldn’tfind any powerful spells that we had the instructions for but couldn’t cast.But if you can’t get them out of old books, why would anyone bother passing them on by word of mouth after they stopped working? Did you getthe data on the Squib couples?”Draco started to hand the parchment over—But Harry Potter held up a hand. “Law of science, Draco. First I tellyou the theory and the prediction. Then you show me the data. That wayyou know I’m not just making up a theory to fit; you know that the theoryactually predicted the data in advance. I have to explain this to you anyway,so I have to explain it before you show me the data. That’s the rule. So puton your cloak and let’s sit down.”Harry Potter sat down at a desk with torn scraps of paper arrangedacross its surface. Draco drew his cloak out of his bookbag, drew it on,and sat down across from Harry on the other side, giving the paper scrapsa puzzled look. They were arranged in two rows and the rows were abouttwenty scraps long.“The secret of blood,” said Harry Potter, an intense look on his face,“is something called deoxyribonucleic acid. You don’t say that name infront of anyone who’s not a scientist. Deoxyribonucleic acid is the recipethat tells your body how to grow, two legs, two arms, short or tall, whetheryou have brown eyes or green. It’s a material thing, you can see it if youhave microscopes, which are like telescopes only they look at things that370 *are very small instead of very far away. And that recipe has two copies ofeverything, always, in case one copy is broken. Imagine two long rowsof pieces of paper. At each place in the row, there are two pieces of paper, and when you have children, your body selects one piece of paper atrandom from each place in the row, and the mother’s body will do thesame, and so the child also gets two pieces of paper at each place in therow. Two copies of everything, one from your mother, one from your father, and when you have children they get one piece of paper from you atrandom in each place.”As Harry spoke, his fingers ranged over the paired scraps of paper,pointing to one part of the pair when he said “from your mother”, theother when he said “from your father”. And as Harry talked about pickinga piece of paper at random, his hand pulled a Knut out of his robes andflipped it; Harry looked at the coin, and then pointed to the top piece ofpaper. All without a pause in the speech.“Now when it comes to something like being short or tall, there’s a lotof places in the recipe that make little differences. So if a tall father marries a short mother, the child gets some pieces of paper saying ‘tall’ andsome pieces of paper saying ‘short’, and usually the child ends up middlesized. But not always. By luck, the child might get a lot of pieces saying‘tall’, and not many papers saying ‘short’, and grow up pretty tall. Youcould have a tall father with five papers saying ‘tall’ and a tall mother withfive papers saying ‘tall’ and by amazing luck the child gets all ten paperssaying ‘tall’ and ends up taller than both of them. You see? Blood isn’t aperfect fluid, it doesn’t mix perfectly. Deoxyribonucleic acid is made upof lots of little pieces, like a glass of pebbles instead of a glass of water.That’s why a child isn’t always exactly in the middle of the parents.”Draco listened with his mouth open. How in Merlin’s name had theMuggles figured all this out? They could see the recipe?“Now,” Harry Potter said, “suppose that, just like with tallness, there’slots of little places in the recipe where you can have a piece of paper thatsays ‘magic’ or ‘not magic’. If you have enough pieces of paper saying‘magic’ you’re a wizard, if you have a lot of pieces of paper you’re a powerful wizard, if you have too few you’re a Muggle, and in between you’rea Squib. Then, when two Squibs marry, most of the time the childrenshould also be Squibs, but once in a while a child will get lucky and getmost of the father’s magic papers and most of the mother’s magic papers,and be strong enough to be a wizard. But probably not a very powerful one. If you started out with a lot of powerful wizards and they married only each other, they would stay powerful. But if they started marrying Muggleborns who were just barely magical, or Squibs… you see? Theblood wouldn’t mix perfectly, it would be a glass of pebbles, not a glassof water, because that’s just the way blood works. There would still bepowerful wizards now and then, when they got a lot of magic papers byluck. But they wouldn’t be as powerful as the most powerful wizards fromearlier.”Draco nodded slowly. He’d never heard it explained that way before.There was a surprising beauty to how exactly it fit.“But,” Harry said. “That’s only one hypothesis. Suppose that insteadthere’s only a single place in the recipe that makes you a wizard. Only oneplace where a piece of paper can say ‘magic’ or ‘not magic’. And there aretwo copies of everything, always. So then there are only three possibilities. Both copies can say ‘magic’. One copy can say ‘magic’ and one copycan say ‘not magic’. Or both copies can say ‘not magic’. Wizards, Squibs,and Muggles. Two copies and you can cast spells, one copy and you canstill use potions or magic devices, and zero copies means you might evenhave trouble looking straight at magic. Muggleborns wouldn’t really beborn to Muggles, they would be born to two Squibs, two parents each withone magic copy who’d grown up in the Muggle world. Now imagine awitch marries a Squib. Each child will get one paper saying ‘magic’ fromthe mother, always, it doesn’t matter which piece gets picked at random,both say ‘magic’. But like flipping a coin, half the time the child will geta paper saying ‘magic’ from the father, and half the time the child willget the father’s paper saying ‘not magic’. When a witch marries a Squib,the result won’t be a lot of weak wizarding children. Half the childrenwill be wizards and witches just as powerful as their mother, and half thechildren will be Squibs. Because if there’s just one place in the recipe thatmakes you a wizard, then magic isn’t like a glass of pebbles that can mix.It’s like a single magical pebble, a sorcerer’s stone.”Harry arranged three pairs of papers side by side. On one pair he372 *wrote ‘magic’ and ‘magic’. On another pair he wrote ‘magic’ on the toppaper only. And the third pair he left blank.“In which case,” Harry said, “either you have two stones or you don’t.Either you’re a wizard or not. Powerful wizards would get that way bystudying harder and practicing more. And if wizards get inherently lesspowerful, not because of spells being lost but because people can’t castthem… then maybe they’re eating the wrong foods or something. But ifit’s gotten steadily worse over eight hundred years, then that could meanmagic itself is fading out of the world.”Harry arranged another two pairs of papers side by side, and took outa quill. Soon each pair had one piece of paper saying ‘magic’ and the otherpaper blank.“And that brings me to the prediction,” said Harry. “What happenswhen two Squibs marry. Flip a coin twice. It can come up heads andheads, heads and tails, tails and heads, or tails and tails. So one quarterof the time you’ll get two heads, one quarter of the time you’ll get twotails, and half the time you’ll get one heads and one tail. Same thing iftwo Squibs marry. One quarter of the children would come up magicand magic, and be wizards. One quarter would come up not-magic andnot-magic, and be Muggles. The other half would be Squibs. It’s a veryold and very classic pattern. It was discovered by Gregor Mendel who isnot forgotten, and it was the first hint ever uncovered for how the recipeworked. Anyone who knows anything about blood science would recognize that pattern in an instant. It wouldn’t be exact, any more than if youflip a coin twice forty times you’ll always get exactly ten pairs of two heads.But if it’s seven or thirteen wizards out of forty children that’ll be a strongindicator. That’s the test I had you do. Now let’s see your data.”And before Draco could even think, Harry Potter had taken the parchment out of Draco’s hand.Draco’s throat was very dry.Twenty-eight children.He wasn’t sure of the exact number but he was pretty sure around afourth had been wizards.“Six wizards out of twenty-eight children,” Harry Potter said after amoment. “Well, that’s that, then. And first-years were casting the same373 *spells at the same power level eight centuries ago, too. Your test and mytest both came out the same way.”There was a long silence in the classroom.“What now?” Draco whispered.He’d never been so terrified.“It’s not definite yet,” said Harry Potter. “My experiment failed,remember? I need you to design another test, Draco.”“I, I…” Draco said. His voice was breaking. “I can’t do this Harry, it’stoo much for me.”Harry’s look was fierce. “Yes you can, because you have to. I thoughtabout it myself, too, after I found out about the Interdict of Merlin.Draco, is there any way of observing the strength of magic directly?Some way that doesn’t have anything to do with wizards’ blood or thespells we learn?”Draco’s mind was just blank.“Anything that affects magic affects wizards,” said Harry. “But thenwe can’t tell if it’s the wizards or the magic. What does magic affect thatisn’t a wizard?”“Magical creatures, obviously,” said Draco without even thinkingabout it.Harry Potter slowly smiled. “Draco, that’s brilliant.”It’s the sort of dumb question you’d only ask in the first place if you’d beenraised by Muggles.Then the sickness in Draco’s stomach got even worse as he realizedwhat it would mean if magical creatures were getting weaker. They wouldknow for certain then that magic was fading, and there was a part ofDraco that was already sure that was exactly what they would find. Hedidn’t want to see this, he didn’t want to know…Harry Potter was already halfway to the door. “Come on, Draco!There’s a portrait not far from here, we’ll just ask them to go get someoneold and find out right away! We’re cloaked, if someone sees us we canjust run away! Let’s go!”374 *It didn’t take long after that.It was a wide portrait, but the three people in it were looking rathercrowded. There was a middle-aged man from the twelfth century,dressed in black swathes of cloth; who spoke to a sad-looking youngwoman from the fourteenth century, with hair that seemed to constantlyfrizz about her head as if she’d been charged up by a static spell; andshe spoke to a dignified, wizened old man from the seventeenth centurywith a solid gold bowtie; and him they could understand.They had asked about Dementors.They had asked about phoenixes.They had asked about dragons and trolls and house elves.Harry had frowned, pointed out that creatures which needed themost magic could just be dying out entirely, and had asked for the mostpowerful magical creatures known.There wasn’t anything unfamiliar on the list, except for a species ofDark creature called mind flayers which the translator noted had finallybeen exterminated by Harold Shea, and those didn’t sound half as scaryas Dementors.Magical creatures were as powerful now as they’d ever been, apparently.The sickness in Draco’s stomach was easing, and now he just felt confused.“Harry,” Draco said in the middle of the old man translating a list ofall eleven powers of a beholder’s eyes, “what does this mean?”Harry held up a finger and the old man finished the list.Then Harry thanked all the portraits for helping—Draco, pretty muchon automatic, did so as well and more graciously—and they headed backto the classroom.And Harry brought out the original parchment with the hypotheses,and began scribbling.Observation:Wizardry isn’t as powerful now as it was when Hogwarts wasfounded.375 *Hypotheses:1. Magic itself is fading.2. Wizards are interbreeding with Muggles and Squibs.3. Knowledge to cast powerful spells is being lost.4. Wizards are eating the wrong foods as children, or something else besides blood is making them grow up weaker.5. Muggle technology is interfering with magic. (Since 800years ago?)6. Stronger wizards are having fewer children. (Draco = onlychild? Check if 3 powerful wizards, Quirrell / Dumbledore /Dark Lord, had any children.)Tests:A. Are there spells we know but can’t cast (1 or 2) or are the lostspells no longer known (3)? Result: Inconclusive due to Interdict of Merlin. No known uncastable spell, but could simply have not been passed on.B. Did ancient first-year students cast the same sort of spells,with the same power, as now? (Weak evidence for 1 over 2, butblood could also be losing powerful wizardry only.) Result:Same level of first-year spells then as now.C. Additional test that distinguishes 1 and 2 using scientificknowledge of blood, will explain later. Result: There’s onlyone place in the recipe that makes you a wizard, and eitheryou have two papers saying ‘magic’ or you don’t.D. Are magical creatures losing their powers? Distinguishes 1from (2 or 3). Result: Magical creatures seem to be as strongas they ever were.“A failed,” said Harry Potter. “B is weak evidence for 1 over 2. C falsifies 2. D falsifies 1. 4 was unlikely and B argues against 4 as well. 5 was376 *unlikely and D argues against it. 6 is falsified along with 2. That leaves3. Interdict of Merlin or not, I didn’t actually find any known spell thatcouldn’t be cast. So when you add it all up, it looks like knowledge is beinglost.”And the trap snapped shut.As soon as the panic went away, as soon as Draco understood thatmagic wasn’t fading out, it took all of five seconds to realize.Draco shoved himself away from the desk and stood up so hard thathis chair skittered with a scraping noise across the floor and fell over.“So it was all just a stupid trick, then.”Harry Potter stared at him for a moment, still sitting. When he spoke,his voice was quiet. “It was a fair test, Draco. If it had come out a differentway, I would have accepted it. That’s not something I would ever cheat on.Ever. I didn’t look at your data before I made my predictions. I told youup front when the Interdict of Merlin invalidated the first experiment—”“Oh,” Draco said, the anger starting to come out into his voice, “youdidn’t know how the whole thing was going to come out?”“I didn’t know anything you didn’t know,” Harry said, still quietly. “Iadmit that I suspected. Hermione Granger was too powerful, she shouldhave been barely magical and she wasn’t, how can a Muggleborn be thebest spellcaster in Hogwarts? And she’s getting the best grades on heressays too, it’s too much coincidence for one girl to be the strongest magically and academically unless there’s a single cause. Hermione Granger’sexistence pointed to there being only one thing that makes you a wizard, something you either have or you don’t, and the power differencescoming from how much we know and how much we practice. And thereweren’t different classes for purebloods and Muggleborns, and so on.There were too many ways the world didn’t look the way it would look ifyou were right. But Draco, I didn’t see anything you couldn’t see too. Ididn’t perform any tests I didn’t tell you about. I didn’t cheat, Draco. Iwanted us to work out the answer together. And I never thought thatmagic might be fading out of the world until you said it. It was a scaryidea for me, too.”“Whatever,” Draco said. He was working very hard to control his voiceand not just start screaming at Harry. “You claim you’re not going to run377 *off and tell anyone else about this.”“Not without consulting you first,” Harry said. He opened his handsin a pleading gesture. “Draco, I’m being as nice as I can but the worldturned out to just not be that way.”“Fine. Then you and I are through. I’m going to just walk away andforget any of this ever happened.”Draco spun around, feeling the burning sensation in his throat, thesense of betrayal, and that was when he realized he really had liked HarryPotter, and that thought didn’t slow him down for a moment as he strodetoward the classroom door.And Harry Potter’s voice came, now louder, and worried:“Draco… you can’t forget. Don’t you understand? That was your sacrifice.”Draco stopped in midstride and turned around. “What are you talkingabout?”But there was already a freezing coldness in Draco’s spine.He knew even before Harry Potter said it.“To become a scientist. You questioned one of your beliefs, not just asmall belief but something that had great significance to you. You did experiments, gathered data, and the outcome proved the belief was wrong.You saw the results and understood what they meant.” Harry Potter’svoice was faltering. “Remember, Draco, you can’t sacrifice a true beliefthat way, because the experiments will confirm it instead of falsifying it.Your sacrifice to become a scientist was your false belief that wizard bloodwas mixing and getting weaker.”“That’s not true!” said Draco. “I didn’t sacrifice the belief. I still believethat!” His voice was getting louder, and the chill was getting worse.Harry Potter shook his head. His voice came in a whisper. “Draco…I’m sorry, Draco, you don’t believe it, not anymore.” Harry’s voice roseagain. “I’ll prove it to you. Imagine that someone tells you they’re keeping a dragon in their house. You tell them you want to see it. They sayit’s an invisible dragon. You say fine, you’ll listen to it move. They sayit’s an inaudible dragon. You say you’ll throw some cooking flour into theair and see the outline of the dragon. They say the dragon is permeable toflour. And the telling thing is that they know, in advance, exactly which ex*378 *perimental results they’ll have to explain away. They know everything willcome out the way it does if there’s no dragon, they know in advance justwhich excuses they’ll have to make. So maybe they say there’s a dragon.Maybe they believe they believe there’s a dragon, it’s called belief-in-belief.But they don’t actually believe it. You can be mistaken about what youbelieve, most people never realize there’s a difference between believingsomething and thinking it’s good to believe it.” Harry Potter had risenfrom the desk now, and taken a few steps toward Draco. “And Draco,you don’t believe any more in blood purism, I’ll show you that you don’t.If blood purism is true, then Hermione Granger doesn’t make sense, sowhat could explain her? Maybe she’s a wizarding orphan raised by Muggles, just like I was? I could go to Granger and ask to see pictures of herparents, to see if she looks like them. Would you expect her to look different? Should we go perform that test?”“They would have put her with relatives,” Draco said, his voice trembling. “They’ll still look the same.”“You see. You already know what experimental result you’ll have toexcuse. If you still believed in blood purism you would say, sure, let’s gotake a look, I bet she won’t look like her parents, she’s too powerful to bea real Muggleborn—”“They would have put her with relatives!”“Scientists can do tests to check for sure if someone is the true childof a father. Granger would probably do it if I paid her family enough. Shewouldn’t be afraid of the results. So what do you expect that test to show?Tell me to run it and we will. But you already know what the test will say.You’ll always know. You won’t ever be able to forget. You might wish youbelieved in blood purism, but you’ll always expect to see happen just exactlywhat would happen if there was only one thing that made you a wizard.That was your sacrifice to become a scientist.”Draco’s breathing was ragged. “Do you realize what you’ve done?”Draco surged forward and he seized Harry by the collar of his robes.His voice rose to a scream, it sounded unbearably loud in the closedclassroom and the silence. “Do you realize what you’ve done?”Harry’s voice was shaky. “You had a belief. The belief was false. Ihelped you see that. What’s true is already so, owning up to it doesn’t379 *make it worse—”The fingers on Draco’s right hand clenched into a fist and that handdropped down and blasted up unstoppably and punched Harry Potter inthe jaw so hard that his body went crashing back into a desk and then tothe floor.“Idiot!” screamed Draco. “Idiot! Idiot!”“Draco,” whispered Harry from the floor, “Draco, I’m sorry, I didn’tthink this would happen for months, I didn’t expect you to awaken as ascientist this quickly, I thought I would have longer to prepare you, teachyou the techniques that make it hurt less to admit you’re wrong—”“What about Father?” Draco said. His voice trembled with rage.“Were you going to prepare him or did you just not care what happenedafter this?”“You can’t tell him!” Harry said, his voice rising in alarm. “He’s not ascientist! You promised, Draco!”For a moment the thought of Father not knowing came as a relief.And then the real anger started to rise.“So you planned for me to lie to him and tell him I still believe,” Dracosaid, voice shaking. “I’ll always have to lie to him, and now when I growup I can’t be a Death Eater, and I won’t even be able to tell him why not.”“If your father really loves you,” whispered Harry from the floor, “he’llstill love you even if you don’t become a Death Eater, and it sounds likeyour father does really love you, Draco—”“Your stepfather is a scientist,” Draco said. The words coming out likebiting knives. “If you weren’t going to be a scientist, he would still loveyou. But you’d be a little less special to him.”Harry flinched. The boy opened his mouth, as if to say ‘I’m sorry’, andthen closed his mouth, seeming to think better of it, which was either verysmart of him or very lucky, because Draco might have tried to kill him.“You should have warned me,” Draco said. His voice rose. “You shouldhave warned me!”“I… I did… every time I told you about the power, I told you about theprice. I said, you have to admit you’re wrong. I said this would be thehardest path for you. That this was the sacrifice anyone had to make tobecome a scientist. I said, what if the experiment says one thing and yourfamily and friends say another—”“You call that a warning?” Draco was screaming now. “You call that awarning? When we’re doing a ritual that calls for a permanent sacrifice?”“I… I…” The boy on the floor swallowed. “I guess maybe it wasn’t clear.I’m sorry. But that which can be destroyed by the truth should be.”Hitting him wasn’t enough.“You’re wrong about one thing,” Draco said, his voice deadly. “Granger isn’t the strongest student in Hogwarts. She just gets the best gradesin class. You’re about to find out the difference.”Sudden shock showed in Harry’s face, and he tried to roll quickly tohis feet—It was already too late for him.“Expelliarmus!”Harry’s wand flew across the room.“Gom jabbar!”A pulse of inky blackness struck Harry’s left hand.“That’s a torture spell,” said Draco. “It’s for getting information outof people. I’m just going to leave it on you and lock the door behind mewhen I go. Maybe I’ll set the locking spell to wear off after a few hours.Maybe it won’t wear off until you die in here. Have fun.”Draco moved smoothly backward, wand still on Harry. Draco’s handdipped down, picked up his bookbag, without his aim wavering.The pain was already showing in Harry Potter’s face as he spoke. “Malfoys are above the underage magic laws, I take it? It’s not because yourblood is stronger. It’s because you already practiced. In the beginningyou were as weak as any of us. Is my prediction wrong?”Draco’s hand whitened on his wand, but his aim stayed steady.“Just so you know,” Harry said through gritted teeth, “if you’d told meI was wrong I would have listened. I won’t ever torture you when you showme that I’m wrong. And you will. Someday. You’re awakened as a scientist now, and even if you never learn to use your power, you’ll always,”Harry gasped, “be looking, for ways, to test, your beliefs—”Draco’s backing away was less smooth, now, a little faster, and he hadto work to keep his wand on Harry as he reached back to open the doorand stepped back out of the classroom.Then Draco shut the door again.He cast the most powerful locking Charm he knew.Draco waited until he heard Harry’s first scream before casting theQuietus.And then he walked away.“Aaahhhhh! Finite Incantatem! Aaaahhh!”Harry’s left hand had been put into a pot of boiling cooking oil andleft there. He’d put everything he had into the Finite Incantatem and it stillwasn’t working.Some hexes required specific counters or you couldn’t undo them, ormaybe it was just that Draco was that much stronger.“Aaaaahhhh!”Harry’s hand was really starting to hurt, now, and that was interferingwith his attempts to think creatively.But a few screams later, Harry realized what he had to do.His pouch, unfortunately, was on the wrong side of his body, and ittook some twisting to reach into it, especially with his other arm flailingaround in a reflex, unstoppable attempt to fling off the source of pain. Bythe time he managed it his other arm had managed to throw away hiswand again.“Medical ahhhhh kit! Medical kit!”On the floor, the green light was too dim to see by.Harry couldn’t stand. He couldn’t crawl. He rolled across the floor towhere he thought his wand was, and it wasn’t there, and with one handhe managed to raise himself high enough to see his wand, and he rolledthere, and got the wand, and rolled back to where the medical kit wasopened. There was also a good deal of screaming, and a bit of throwingup.382 *It took eight tries before Harry could cast Lumos.And then, well, the package wasn’t designed to be opened onehanded, because all wizards were idiots, that was why. Harry had to usehis teeth and so it took a while before Harry finally managed to wrap theNumbcloth over his left hand.When all feeling in his left hand was finally gone, Harry let his mindcome apart, and lay motionless on the floor, and cried for a while.Well, Harry’s mind said silently into itself, when it had recoveredenough to think in words again. Was it worth it?Slowly, Harry’s functional hand reached up to a desk.Harry pulled himself to his feet.Took a deep breath.Exhaled.Smiled.It wasn’t much of a smile, but it was a smile nonetheless.Thank you, Professor Quirrell, I couldn’t have lost without you.He hadn’t redeemed Draco yet, not even close. Contrary to whatDraco himself might now believe, Draco was still the child of a DeathEater, through and through. Still a boy who’d grown up thinking “rape”was something the cool older kids did. But it was one heck of a start.Harry couldn’t claim it had all gone just as planned. It had all gonejust as completely made up on the spot. The plan hadn’t called for this tohappen until December or thereabouts, after Harry had taught Draco thetechniques not to deny the evidence when he saw it.But he’d seen the look of fear on Draco’s face, realized that Dracowas already taking an alternative hypothesis seriously, and seized the moment. One case of true curiosity had the same sort of redeeming powerin rationality that one case of true love had in movies.In retrospect, Harry had given himself hours to make the most important discovery in the history of magic, and months to break through theundeveloped mental barriers of an eleven-year-old boy. This could indicate that Harry had some sort of major cognitive deficit with respect toestimating task completion times.Was Harry going to Science Hell for what he’d done? Harry wasn’tsure. He’d contrived to keep Draco’s mind on the possibility that magic383 *was fading, made sure Draco would carry out the part of the experimentthat would seem at first to point in that direction. He’d waited until afterexplaining genetics to prompt Draco into realizing about magical creatures (though Harry had thought in terms of ancient artifacts like theSorting Hat, which no one could duplicate anymore, but which continuedto function). But Harry hadn’t actually exaggerated any evidence, hadn’tdistorted the meaning of any results. When the Interdict of Merlin hadinvalidated the test that should have been definitive, he’d told Draco upfront.And then there was the part after that…But he hadn’t actually lied to Draco. Draco had believed it, and thatwould make it true.The end, admittedly, had not been fun.Harry turned, and staggered toward the door.Time to test Draco’s locking spell.The first step was simply trying to turn the doorknob. Draco couldhave been bluffing.Draco hadn’t been bluffing.“Finite Incantatem.” Harry’s voice came out rather hoarse, and he couldfeel that the spell hadn’t taken.So Harry tried it again, and that time it felt true. But another twist atthe doorknob showed it hadn’t worked. No surprise there.Time to bring out the big guns. Harry drew a deep breath. This spellwas one of the most powerful he’d learned so far.“Alohomora!”Harry staggered a little after saying it.And the classroom door still didn’t open.That shocked Harry. Harry hadn’t been planning to go anywhere nearDumbledore’s forbidden corridor, of course. But a spell to open magical locks had seemed like a useful sort of spell anyway, and so Harry hadlearned it. Was Dumbledore’s forbidden corridor meant to lure peopleso stupid that they didn’t notice the security was worse than what DracoMalfoy could put on it?Fear was creeping back into Harry’s system. The placard in the medical kit had said the Numbcloth could only safely be used for up to thirty384 *minutes. After that it would come off automatically, and not be reusablefor 24 hours. Right now it was 6:51pm. He’d put on the Numbcloth aboutfive minutes ago.So Harry took a step back, and considered the door. It was a solidpanel of dark oaken wood, interrupted only by the brass metal doorknob.Harry didn’t know any explosive or cutting or smashing spells, andTransfiguring explosive would have violated the rule against Transfiguring things to be burned. Acid was a liquid and would have made fumes…But that was no obstacle to a creative thinker.Harry laid his wand against one of the door’s brass hinges, and concentrated on the form of cotton as a pure abstraction apart from any material cotton, and also on the pure material apart from the pattern thatmade it a brass hinge, and brought the two concepts together, imposingshape on substance. An hour of Transfiguration practice every day for amonth had gotten Harry to the point where he could Transfigure a subject of five cubic centimeters in just under a minute.After two minutes the hinge hadn’t changed at all.Whoever had designed Draco’s locking spell, they’d thought of that,too. Or the door was part of Hogwarts and the castle was immune.A glance showed the walls to be solid stone. So was the floor. Sowas the ceiling. You couldn’t separately Transfigure a part of somethingthat was a solid whole; Harry would have needed to try Transfiguring thewhole wall, which would have taken hours or maybe days of continuouseffort, if he could have done it at all, and if the wall wasn’t contiguouswith the rest of the whole castle…Harry’s Time-Turner wouldn’t open until 9pm. After that he could goback to 6pm, before the door was locked.How long would the torture spell last?Harry swallowed hard. Tears were coming into his eyes again.His brilliantly creative mind had just offered the ingenious suggestion that Harry could cut his hand off using the hacksaw in the toolsetstored in his pouch, which would hurt, obviously, but might hurt a lotless than Draco’s pain spell, since the nerves would be gone; and he hadtourniquets in the healer’s kit.385 *And that was obviously a hideously stupid idea that Harry would regret the rest of his entire life.But Harry didn’t know if he could hold out for two hours under torture.He wanted out of this classroom, he wanted out of this classroom now,he didn’t want to wait in here screaming for two hours until he could usethe Time-Turner, he needed to get out and find someone to get the torturespell off his hand…Think! Harry screamed at his brain. Think! Think!The Slytherin dorm was mostly empty. People were at dinner. For somereason Draco himself wasn’t feeling very hungry.Draco closed the door to his private room, locked it, Charmed it shut,Quieted it, sat down on his bed, and started to cry.It wasn’t fair.It wasn’t fair.It was the first time Draco had ever really lost before, Father hadwarned him that losing for real would hurt the first time it happened,but he’d lost so much, it wasn’t fair, it wasn’t fair for him to lose everythingthe very first time he lost.Somewhere in the dungeons, a boy Draco had actually liked wasscreaming in pain. Draco had never hurt anyone he’d liked before. Punishing people who deserved it was supposed to be fun, but this just feltsick inside. Father hadn’t warned him about that, and Draco wonderedif it was a hard lesson everyone had to learn when they grew up, or ifDraco was just weak.Draco wished it were Pansy screaming. That would have felt better.And the worst part was knowing that it might have been a mistake tohurt Harry Potter.Who else was there for Draco now? Dumbledore? After what he’ddone? Draco would sooner have been burned alive.386 *Draco would have to go back to Harry Potter because there wasnowhere else for him to go. And if Harry Potter said he didn’t want him,then Draco would be nothing, just a pathetic little boy who could neverbe a Death Eater, never join Dumbledore’s faction, never learn science.The trap had been perfectly set, perfectly executed. Father hadwarned Draco over and over that what you sacrificed to Dark ritualscouldn’t be regained. But Father hadn’t known that the accursed Muggles had invented rituals that didn’t need wands, rituals you could betricked into doing without knowing it, and that was only one of the terrible secrets which scientists knew and which Harry Potter had broughtwith him.Draco started crying harder, then.He didn’t want this, he didn’t want this but there was no turning back.It was too late. He was already a scientist.Draco knew he should go back and free Harry Potter and apologize.It would have been the smart thing to do.Instead Draco stayed in his bed and sobbed.He’d already hurt Harry Potter. It might be the only time Draco evergot to hurt him, and he would have to hold to that one memory for therest of his life.Let him keep screaming.Harry dropped the remnants of his hacksaw to the ground. The brasshinges had proved impervious, not even scratched, and Harry was beginning to suspect that even the desperation act of trying to Transfigure acidor explosives would have failed to open this door. On the plus side, the attempt had destroyed the hacksaw.His watch said it was 7:02pm, with less than fifteen minutes left, andHarry tried to remember if there were any other sharp things in his pouchthat needed destroying, and felt another fit of tears welling up. If only,when his Time-Turner opened, he could go back and prevent—And that was when Harry realized he was being silly.It wasn’t the first time he’d been locked in a room.387 *Professor McGonagall had already told him the correct way to do this.…she’d also told him not to use the Time-Turner for this sort of thing.Would Professor McGonagall realize that this occasion really did warrant a special exception? Or just take away the Time-Turner entirely?Harry gathered up all his things, all the evidence, into his pouch. AScourgify took care of the vomit on the floor, though not the sweat thathad soaked his robes. He left the overturned desks overturned, it wasn’timportant enough to be worth doing with one hand.When he was done, Harry glanced down at his watch. 7:04pm.And then Harry waited. Seconds passed, feeling like years.At 7:07pm, the door opened.Professor Flitwick’s puff-bearded face looked rather concerned. “Areyou all right, Harry?” said the squeaky voice of Ravenclaw’s Head ofHouse. “I got a note saying you’d been locked in here—”388 *Act 3:waited in a small windowed alcove he’d found near the GreatDracoHall, stomach churning.There would be a price, and it would not be small. Draco had knownthat as soon as he’d woken up and realized that he didn’t dare enter theGreat Hall for breakfast because he might see Harry Potter there andDraco didn’t know what would happen after that.Footsteps approached.“Here ya go,” said Vincent’s voice. “Now da boss ain’t in a good moodtoday, so ya’d better watch your step.”Draco was going to skin that idiot alive and send back the flayed bodywith a request for a more intelligent servant, like a dead gerbil.One set of footsteps went off, and the other set of footsteps camecloser.The churning in Draco’s stomach got worse.Harry Potter came into sight. His face was carefully neutral, but hisblue-trimmed robes looked oddly askew, as if they hadn’t been put onquite right—“Your hand,” Draco said without thinking about it at all.Harry raised his left arm, as though to look at it himself.The hand dangled limply from it, like something dead.389 *“Madam Pomfrey said it’s not permanent,” Harry said quietly. “Shesaid it should mostly recover by the time classes start tomorrow.”For a single instant the news came as a relief.And then Draco realized.“You went to Madam Pomfrey,” whispered Draco.“Of course I did,” said Harry Potter, as though stating the obvious.“My hand wasn’t working.”It was slowly dawning on Draco what an absolute fool he’d been, farworse than the older Slytherins he’d chewed out.He’d just taken for granted that no one would go to the authoritieswhen a Malfoy did something to them. That no one would want LuciusMalfoy’s eye on them, ever.But Harry Potter wasn’t a frightened little Hufflepuff trying to stayout of the game. He was already playing it, and Father’s eye was alreadyon him.“What else did Madam Pomfrey say?” said Draco, his heart in histhroat.“Professor Flitwick said that the spell cast on my hand had been a Darktorture hex and extremely serious business, and that refusing to say whodid it was absolutely unacceptable.”There was a long pause.“And then?” Draco said in a shaking voice.Harry Potter smiled slightly. “I apologized deeply, which made Professor Flitwick look very stern, and then I told Professor Flitwick that thewhole thing was, indeed, extremely serious, secret, delicate business, andthat I’d already informed the Headmaster about the project.”Draco gasped. “No! Flitwick isn’t going to just accept that! He’ll checkwith Dumbledore!”“Indeed,” said Harry Potter. “I was promptly hauled off to the Headmaster’s office.”Draco was trembling now. If Dumbledore brought Harry Potter before the Wizengamot, willingly or otherwise, and had the Boy-Who-Livedtestify under Veritaserum that Draco had tortured him… too many peopleloved Harry Potter, Father could lose that vote…Father might be able to convince Dumbledore not to do that, butit would cost. Cost terribly. The game had rules now, you couldn’t justthreaten someone at random any more. But Draco had walked intoDumbledore’s hands of his own free will. And Draco was a very valuablehostage.Though since Draco couldn’t be a Death Eater now, he wasn’t as valuable as Father thought.The thought tore at his heart like a Cutting Charm.“Then what?” whispered Draco.“Dumbledore deduced immediately that it was you. He knew we’dbeen associating.”The worst possible scenario. If Dumbledore hadn’t guessed who didit, he might not have risked using Legilimency just to find out… but ifDumbledore knew…“And?” Draco forced out the word.“We had a little chat.”“And?”Harry Potter grinned. “And I explained that it would be in his bestinterest not to do anything.”Draco’s mind ran into a brick wall and splattered. He just stared atHarry Potter with his mouth hanging slack like a fool.It took that long for Draco to remember.Harry knew Dumbledore’s mysterious secret, the one Snape used ashis hold.Draco could just see it now. Dumbledore looking all stern, concealinghis eagerness as he explained to Harry what a terribly serious matter thiswas.And Harry politely telling Dumbledore to keep his mouth shut if heknew what was good for him.Father had warned Draco against people like this, people who couldruin you and still be so likable that it was hard to hate them properly.“After which,” Harry said, “the Headmaster told Professor Flitwickthat this was, indeed, a secret and delicate matter of which he had alreadybeen informed, and that he did not think pressing it at this time wouldhelp me or anyone. Professor Flitwick started to say something about theHeadmaster’s usual plotting going much too far, and I had to interruptat that point and explain that it had been my own idea and not anythingthe Headmaster forced me into, so Professor Flitwick spun around andstarted lecturing me, and the Headmaster interrupted him and said thatas the Boy-Who-Lived I was doomed to have weird and dangerous adventures so I was safer if I got into them on purpose instead of waiting forthem to happen by accident, and that was when Professor Flitwick threwup his little hands and started shrieking in a high-pitched voice at both ofus about how he didn’t care what we were cooking up together, but thiswasn’t ever to happen again for as long as I was in Ravenclaw House or hewould have me thrown out and I could go to Gryffindor which was whereall this Dumbledoring belonged—”Harry was making it very hard for Draco to hate him.“Anyway,” Harry said, “I didn’t want to be thrown out of Ravenclaw, soI promised Professor Flitwick that nothing like this would happen again,and if it did, I would just tell him who did it.”Harry’s eyes should have been cold. They weren’t. The voice shouldhave made it a deadly threat. It wasn’t.And Draco saw the question that should have been obvious, and itkilled the mood in an instant.“Why… didn’t you?”Harry walked over to the window, into the small beam of sunlightshining into the alcove, and turned his head outward, toward the greengrounds of Hogwarts. The brightness shone on him, on his robes, on hisface.“Why didn’t I?” Harry said. His voice caught. “I guess because I justcouldn’t get angry at you. I knew I’d hurt you first. I won’t even call it fair,because what I did to you was worse than what you did to me.”It was like running into another brick wall. Harry could have beenspeaking archaic Greek for all Draco understood him then.Draco’s mind scrabbled for patterns and came up flat blank. Thestatement was a concession that hadn’t been in Harry’s best interests.It wasn’t even what Harry should say to make Draco a more loyal servant, now that Harry held power over him. For that Harry should beemphasizing how kindly he’d been, not how much he’d hurt Draco.392 *“Even so,” Harry said, and now his voice was lower, almost a whisper,“please don’t do that again, Draco. It hurt, and I’m not sure I could forgiveyou a second time. I’m not sure I’d be able to want to.”Draco just didn’t get it.Was Harry trying to be friends with him?There was no way Harry Potter could be dumb enough to believe thatwas still possible after what he’d done.You could be someone’s friend and ally, like Draco had tried to do withHarry, or you could destroy their life and leave them no other options.Not both.But then Draco didn’t understand what else Harry could be trying.And a strange thought came to Draco then, something Harry had kepttalking about yesterday.And the thought was: Test it.You’re awakened as a scientist now, Harry had said, and even if you neverlearn to use your power, you’ll always, be looking, for ways, to test, your beliefs…Those ominous words, spoken in gasps of agony, had kept runningthrough Draco’s mind.If Harry was pretending to be the repentant friend who had accidentally hurt someone…“You planned what you did to me!” Draco said, managing to put a noteof accusation in his voice. “You didn’t do it because you got angry, you didit because you wanted to!”Fool, Harry Potter would say, of course I planned it, and now you’re mine—Harry turned back toward Draco. “What happened yesterday wasn’tthe plan,” Harry said, his voice seeming stuck in his throat. “The planwas that I would teach you why you were always better off knowing thetruth, and then we would try together to discover the truth about blood,and whatever the answer was we would accept it. Yesterday I… rushedthings.”“Always better off knowing the truth,” Draco said coldly. “Like you didme a favor.”Harry nodded, blowing Draco’s mind completely, and said, “What ifLucius comes up with the same idea I did, that the problem is strongerwizards having fewer children? He might start a program to pay the393 *strongest purebloods to have more children. In fact, if blood purism wereright, that’s just what Lucius should be doing—addressing the problemon his side, where he can make things happen right away. Right now,Draco, you’re the only friend Lucius has who would try to stop him fromwasting the effort, because you’re the only one who knows the real truthand can predict the real results.”The thought came to Draco that Harry Potter had been raised in aplace so strange that he was now effectively a magical creature ratherthan a wizard. Draco simply couldn’t guess what Harry would say or donext.“Why?” Draco said. Putting pain and betrayal into his voice wasn’thard at all. “Why did you do this to me? What was your plan?”“Well,” Harry said, “you’re Lucius’s heir, and believe it or not, Dumbledore thinks I belong to him. So we could grow up and fight their battleswith each other. Or we could do something else.”Slowly, Draco’s mind wrapped around this. “You want to provoke afight to the finish between them, then seize power after they’re both exhausted.” Draco felt cold dread in his chest. He would have to try and stopthat no matter the cost to himself—But Harry shook his head. “Stars above, no!”“No…?”“You wouldn’t go along with that and neither would I,” said Harry.“This is our world, we don’t want to break it. But imagine, say, Luciusthought the Conspiracy was your tool and you were on his side, Dumbledore thought the Conspiracy was my tool and I was on his side, Luciusthought that you’d turned me and Dumbledore believed the Conspiracywas mine, Dumbledore thought that I’d turned you and Lucius believedthe Conspiracy was yours, and so they both helped us out but only in waysthat the other one wouldn’t notice.”Draco did not have to fake being speechless.Father had once taken him to see a play called The Tragedy of Light,about this incredibly clever Slytherin named Light who’d set out to purify the world of evil using an ancient ring that could kill anyone whosename and face he knew, and who’d been opposed by another incrediblyclever Slytherin, a villain named Lawliet, who’d worn a disguise to conceal394 *his true face; and Draco had shouted and cheered at all the right parts,especially in the middle; and then the play had ended sadly and Dracohad been hugely disappointed and Father had gently pointed out that theword ‘Tragedy’ was right there in the title.Afterward, Father had asked Draco if he understood why they hadgone to see this play.Draco had said it was to teach him to be as cunning as Light andLawliet when he grew up.Father had said that Draco couldn’t possibly be more wrong, andpointed out that while Lawliet had cleverly concealed his face there hadbeen no good reason for him to tell Light his name. Father had then goneon to demolish almost every part of the play, while Draco listened withhis eyes growing wider and wider. And Father had finished by sayingthat plays like this were always unrealistic, because if the playwright hadknown what someone actually as smart as Light would actually do, theplaywright would have tried to take over the world himself instead of justwriting plays about it.That was when Father had told Draco about the Rule of Three, whichwas that any plot which required more than three different things to happen would never work in real life.Father had further explained that since only a fool would attempt aplot that was as complicated as possible, the real limit was two.Draco couldn’t even find words to describe the sheer gargantuan unworkability of Harry’s master plan.But it was just the sort of mistake you would make if you didn’t haveany mentors and thought you were clever and had learned about plottingby watching plays.“So,” said Harry, “what do you think of the plan?”“It’s clever…” Draco said slowly. Shouting brilliant! and gasping inawe would have looked too suspicious. “Harry, can I ask a question?”“Sure,” said Harry.“Why did you buy Granger an expensive pouch?”“To show no hard feelings,” said Harry at once. “Though I expect she’llalso feel awkward if she refuses any small requests I make over the nextcouple of months.”395 *And that was when Draco realized that Harry actually was trying to behis friend.Harry’s move against Granger had been smart, maybe even brilliant.Make your enemy not suspect you, and put them into your debt in afriendly way so that you could maneuver them into position just by askingthem. Draco couldn’t have gotten away with that, his target would havebeen too suspicious, but the Boy-Who-Lived could. So the first step ofHarry’s plot was to give his enemy an expensive present, Draco wouldn’thave thought of that, but it could work…If you were Harry’s enemy, his plots might be hard to see through atfirst, they might even be stupid, but his reasoning would make sense onceyou understood it, you would comprehend that he was trying to hurt you.The way Harry was acting toward Draco right now did not make sense.Because if you were Harry’s friend, then he tried to be friends withyou in the alien, incomprehensible way he’d been raised by Muggles todo, even if it meant destroying your entire life.The silence stretched.“I know that I’ve abused our friendship terribly,” Harry said finally.“But please realize, Draco, that in the end, I just wanted the two of us tofind the truth together. Is that something you can forgive?”A fork with two paths, but with only one path easy to go back on laterif Draco changed his mind…“I guess I understand what you were trying to do,” Draco lied, “so yes.”Harry’s eyes lit up. “I’m glad to hear that, Draco,” he said softly.The two students stood in that alcove, Harry still dipped in the lonesunbeam, Draco in shadow.And Draco realized with a note of horror and despair, that although itwas a terrifying fate indeed to be Harry’s friend, Harry now had so manydifferent avenues for threatening Draco that being his enemy would beeven worse.Probably.Maybe.Well, he could always switch to being enemies later…He was doomed.“So,” Draco said. “Now what?”396 *“We study again next Saturday?”“It better not go like the last one—”“Don’t worry, it won’t,” said Harry. “A few more Saturdays like thatand you’d be ahead of me.”Harry laughed. Draco didn’t.“Oh, and before you go,” Harry said, and grinned sheepishly. “I knowthis is a bad time, but I wanted to ask you for advice about something,actually.”“Okay,” Draco said, still a bit distracted by that last statement.Harry’s eyes grew intent. “Buying that pouch for Granger used upmost of the gold I managed to steal from my Gringotts vault—”What.“—and McGonagall has the vault key, or Dumbledore does now,maybe. And I was just about to launch a plot that might take somemoney, so I was wondering if you know how I can get access—”“I’ll loan you the money,” said Draco’s mouth in sheer existential reflex.Harry looked taken aback, but in a pleased way. “Draco, you don’thave to—”“How much?”Harry named the amount and Draco couldn’t quite keep the shockfrom showing on his face. That was almost all the spending money Fatherhad given Draco to last out the whole year, Draco would be left with justa few Galleons—Then Draco mentally kicked himself. All he had to do was write Fatherand explain that the money was gone because he had managed to loan itto Harry Potter, and Father would send him a special congratulatory notewritten in golden ink, a giant Chocolate Frog that would take two weeksto eat, and ten times as many Galleons just in case Harry Potter neededanother loan.“It’s way too much, isn’t it,” said Harry. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t haveasked—”“Excuse me, I am a Malfoy, you know,” said Draco. “I was just surprised you wanted that much.”397 *“Don’t worry,” Harry Potter said cheerfully. “It’s nothing that threatens your family’s interests, just me being evil.”Draco nodded. “No problem, then. You want to go get it right now?”“Sure,” said Harry.As they left the alcove and started heading toward the dungeons,Draco couldn’t help but ask, “So can you tell me which plot this is for?”“Rita Skeeter.”Draco thought some very bad words to himself, but it was far too lateto say no.By the time they’d reached the dungeons, Draco had started pulling together his thoughts again.He was having trouble hating Harry Potter. Harry had been trying tobe friendly, he was just insane.And that wasn’t going to stop Draco’s revenge or even slow it down.“So,” Draco said, after looking around to make certain no one wasnearby. Their voices would both be Blurred, of course, but it never hurtto be extra sure. “I’ve been thinking. When we bring new recruits intothe Conspiracy, they’re going to have to think we’re equals. Otherwise itwould only take one of them to blow the plot to Father. You already workedthat out, right?”“Naturally,” said Harry.“Will we be equals?” said Draco.“I’m afraid not,” Harry said. It was clear that he was trying to soundgentle, and also clear that he was trying to suppress a good deal of condescension and not quite succeeding. “I’m sorry, Draco, but you don’teven know what the word Bayesian in Bayesian Conspiracy means rightnow. You’re going to have to study for months before we take anyoneelse in, just so you can put up a good front.”“Because I don’t know enough science,” Draco said, carefully keepinghis voice neutral.Harry shook his head at that. “The problem isn’t that you’re ignorantof specific science things like deoxyribonucleic acid. That wouldn’t stop398 *you from being my equal. The problem is that you aren’t trained in themethods of rationality, the deeper secret knowledge behind how all thosediscoveries got made in the first place. I’ll try to teach you those, butthey’re a lot harder to learn. Think of what we did yesterday, Draco. Yes,you did some of the work. But I was the only one in control. You answeredsome of the questions. I asked all of them. You helped push. I did thesteering by myself. And without the methods of rationality, Draco, youcan’t possibly steer the Conspiracy where it needs to go.”“I see,” said Draco, his voice sounding disappointed.Harry’s voice tried to gentle itself even more. “I’ll try to respect yourexpertise, Draco, about things like people stuff. But you need to respectmy expertise too, and there’s just no way you could be my equal when itcomes to steering the Conspiracy. You’ve only been a scientist for one day,you know one secret about deoxyribonucleic acid, and you aren’t trainedin any of the methods of rationality.”“I understand,” said Draco.And he did.People stuff, Harry had said. Seizing control of the Conspiracy probably wouldn’t even be difficult. And afterward, he would kill Harry Potterjust to be sure—The memory rose up in Draco of how sick inside it had felt last night,knowing Harry was screaming.Draco thought some more bad words.Fine. He wouldn’t kill Harry. Harry had been raised by Muggles, itwasn’t his fault he was insane.Instead, Harry would live on, just so that Draco could tell him that ithad all been for Harry’s own good, really, he ought to be grateful—And with a sudden twitch of surprised pleasure, Draco realized thatit actually was for Harry’s own good. If Harry tried to carry out his planof playing Dumbledore and Father for fools, he would die.That made it perfect.Draco would take all of Harry’s dreams away from him, just as Harryhad done to him.Draco would tell Harry that it had been for his own good, and it wouldbe absolutely true.399 *Draco would wield the Conspiracy and the power of science to purifythe wizarding world, and Father would be as proud of him as if he’d beena Death Eater.Harry Potter’s evil plots would be foiled, and the forces of right wouldprevail.The perfect revenge.Unless…Just pretend to be pretending to be a scientist, Harry had told him.Draco didn’t have words to describe exactly what was wrong withHarry’s mind—(since Draco had never heard the term depth of recursion)—but he could guess what sort of plots it implied.…unless all that was exactly what Harry wanted Draco to do as part ofsome even larger plot which Draco would play right into by trying to foilthis one, Harry might even know that his plan was unworkable, it mighthave no purpose except luring Draco to thwart it—No. That way lay madness. There had to be a limit. The Dark Lord himself hadn’t been that twisty. That sort of thing didn’t happen in real life,only in Father’s silly bedtime stories about foolish gargoyles who alwaysended up furthering the hero’s plans every time they tried to stop him.And beside Draco, Harry walked along with a smile on his face, thinkingabout the evolutionary origins of human intelligence.In the beginning, before people had quite understood how evolutionworked, they’d gone around thinking crazy ideas like human intelligenceevolved so that we could invent better tools.The reason why this was crazy was that only one person in the tribehad to invent a tool, and then everyone else would use it, and it wouldspread to other tribes, and still be used by their descendants a hundredyears later. That was great from the perspective of scientific progress, butin evolutionary terms, it meant that the person who invented somethingdidn’t have much of a fitness advantage, didn’t have all that many more children than everyone else. Only relative fitness advantages could increasethe relative frequency of a gene in the population, and drive some lonelymutation to the point where it was universal and everyone had it. Andbrilliant inventions just weren’t common enough to provide the sort ofconsistent selection pressure it took to promote a mutation. It was a natural guess, if you looked at humans with their guns and tanks and nuclearweapons and compared them to chimpanzees, that the intelligence wasthere to make the technology. A natural guess, but wrong.Before people had quite understood how evolution worked, they’dgone around thinking crazy ideas like the climate changed, and tribes had tomigrate, and people had to become smarter in order to solve all the novel problems.But human beings had four times the brain size of a chimpanzee. 20%of a human’s metabolic energy went into feeding the brain. Humanswere ridiculously smarter than any other species. That sort of thing didn’thappen because the environment stepped up the difficulty of its problems a little. Then the organisms would just get a little smarter to solvethem. Ending up with that gigantic outsized brain must have taken somesort of runaway evolutionary process, something that would push andpush without limits.And today’s scientists had a pretty good guess at what that runawayevolutionary process had been.Harry had once read a famous book called Chimpanzee Politics. Thebook had described how an adult chimpanzee named Luit had confronted the aging alpha, Yeroen, with the help of a young, recentlymatured chimpanzee named Nikkie. Nikkie had not intervened directlyin the fights between Luit and Yeroen, but had prevented Yeroen’s othersupporters in the tribe from coming to his aid, distracting them whenever a confrontation developed between Luit and Yeroen. And in timeLuit had won, and become the new alpha, with Nikkie as the second mostpowerful……though it hadn’t taken very long after that for Nikkie to form an alliance with the defeated Yeroen, overthrow Luit, and become the new newalpha.It really made you appreciate what millions of years of hominids try*401 *ing to outwit each other—an evolutionary arms race without limit—hadled to in the way of increased mental capacity.’Cause, y’know, a human would have totally seen that one coming.And beside Harry, Draco walked along, suppressing his smile as hethought about his revenge.Someday, maybe in years but someday, Harry Potter would learn justwhat it meant to underestimate a Malfoy.Draco had awakened as a scientist in a single day. Harry had said thatwasn’t supposed to happen for months.But of course if you were a Malfoy, you would be a more powerful scientist than anyone who wasn’t.So Draco would learn all of Harry Potter’s methods of rationality, andthen when the time was ripe—402 *Act 2:(The sun shone brilliantly into the Great Hall from the enchantedsky-ceiling above, illuminating the students as though they sat beneaththe naked sky, gleaming from their plates and bowls, as, refreshed by anight’s sleep, they inhaled breakfast in preparation for whatever plansthey’d made for their Sunday.)So. There was only one thing that made you a wizard.That wasn’t surprising, when you thought about it. What DNA mostlydid was tell ribosomes how to chain amino acids together into proteins.Conventional physics seemed quite capable of describing amino acids,and no matter how many amino acids you chained together, conventional physics said you would never, ever get magic out of it.And yet magic seemed to be hereditary, following DNA.Then that probably wasn’t because the DNA was chaining togethernonmagical amino acids into magical proteins.Rather the key DNA sequence did not, of itself, give you your magicat all.Magic came from somewhere else.(At the Ravenclaw table there was one boy who was staring off intospace, as his right hand automatically spooned some unimportant foodinto his mouth from whatever was in front of him. You probably couldhave substituted a pile of dirt and he wouldn’t have noticed.)403 *And for some reason the Source of Magic was paying attention toa particular DNA marker among individuals who were ordinary apedescended humans in every other way.(Actually there were quite a lot of boys and girls staring off into space.It was the Ravenclaw table, after all.)There were other lines of logic leading to the same conclusion. Complex machinery was always universal within a sexually reproducingspecies. If gene B relied on gene A, then A had to be useful on its own,and rise to near-universality in the gene pool on its own, before B wouldbe useful often enough to confer a fitness advantage. Then once B wasuniversal you would get a variant A* that relied on B, and then C thatrelied on A* and B, then B* that relied on C, until the whole machinewould fall apart if you removed a single piece. But it all had to happenincrementally—evolution never looked ahead, evolution would never startpromoting B in preparation for A becoming universal later. Evolution wasthe simple historical fact that, whichever organisms did in fact have themost children, their genes would in fact be more frequent in the nextgeneration. So each piece of a complex machine had to become nearlyuniversal before other pieces in the machine would evolve to depend onits presence.So complex, interdependent machinery, the powerful sophisticated protein machines that drove life, was always universal within a sexually reproducing species—except for a small handful of non-interdependent variants that were being selected on at any given time, as further complexitywas slowly laid down. It was why all human beings had the same underlying brain design, the same emotions, the same facial expressions wiredup to those emotions; those adaptations were complex, so they had to beuniversal.If magic had been like that, a big complex adaptation with lots of necessary genes, then a wizard mating with a Muggle would have resulted ina child with only half those parts and half the machine wouldn’t do much.And so there would have been no Muggleborns, ever. Even if all the pieceshad individually gotten into the Muggle gene pool, they’d never reassemble all in one place to form a wizard.There hadn’t been some genetically isolated valley of humans that had404 *stumbled onto an evolutionary pathway leading to sophisticated magicalsections of the brain. That complex genetic machinery, if wizards interbred with Muggles, would never have reassembled into Muggleborns.So however your genes made you a wizard, it wasn’t by containing theblueprints for complicated machinery.That was the other reason Harry had guessed the Mendelian patternwould be there. If magical genes weren’t complicated, why would therebe more than one?And yet magic itself seemed pretty complicated. A door-locking spellwould prevent the door from opening and prevent you from Transfiguring the hinges and resist Finite Incantatem and Alohomora. Many elementsall pointing in the same direction: you could call that goal-orientation, orin simpler language, purposefulness.There were only two known causes of purposeful complexity. Natural selection, which produced things like butterflies. And intelligent engineering, which produced things like cars.Magic didn’t seem like something that had self-replicated into existence. Spells were purposefully complicated, but not, like a butterfly,complicated for the purpose of making copies of themselves. Spells werecomplicated for the purpose of serving their user, like a car.Some intelligent engineer, then, had created the Source of Magic, andtold it to pay attention to a particular DNA marker.The obvious next thought was that this had something to do with “Atlantis”.Harry had asked Hermione about that earlier—on the train to Hogwarts, after hearing Draco say it—and so far as she knew, nothing morewas known than the word itself.It might have been pure legend. But it was also plausible enough thata civilization of magic-users, especially one from before the Interdict ofMerlin, would have managed to blow itself up.The line of reasoning continued: Atlantis had been an isolated civilization that had somehow brought into being the Source of Magic, andtold it to serve only people with the Atlantean genetic marker, the bloodof Atlantis.405 *And by similar logic: The words a wizard spoke, the wand movements,those weren’t complicated enough of themselves to build up the spell effects from scratch—not the way that the three billion base pairs of human DNA actually were complicated enough to build a human body fromscratch, not the way that computer programs took up thousands of bytesof data.So the words and wand movements were just triggers, levers pulledon some hidden and more complex machine. Buttons, not blueprints.And just like a computer program wouldn’t compile if you made a single spelling error, the Source of Magic wouldn’t respond to you unless youcast your spells in exactly the right way.The chain of logic was inexorable.And it led inevitably toward a single final conclusion.The ancient forebears of the wizards, thousands of years earlier, hadtold the Source of Magic to only levitate things if you said…‘Wingardium Leviosa.’Harry slumped over at the breakfast table, resting his foreheadwearily on his right hand.There was a story from the dawn days of Artificial Intelligence—backwhen they were just starting out and no one had yet realized the problemwould be difficult—about a professor who had delegated one of his gradstudents to solve the problem of computer vision.Harry was beginning to understand how that grad student must havefelt.This could take a while.Why did it take more effort to cast the Alohomora spell, if it was justlike pressing a button?Who’d been silly enough to build in a spell for Avada Kedavra that couldonly be cast using hatred?Why did wordless Transfiguration require you to make a completemental separation between the concept of form and concept of material?Harry might not be done with this problem by the time he graduatedHogwarts. He could still be working on this problem when he was thirtyyears old. Hermione had been right, Harry hadn’t realized that on a gutlevel before. He’d just given an inspiring speech about determination.406 *Harry’s mind briefly considered whether to get on a gut level that hemight never solve the problem at all, then decided that would be takingthings much too far.Besides, so long as he could get as far as immortality in the first fewdecades, he’d be fine.What method had the Dark Lord used? Come to think, the fact thatthe Dark Lord had somehow managed to survive the death of his firstbody was almost infinitely more important than the fact that he’d tried totake over magical Britain—“Excuse me,” said an expected voice from behind him in very unexpected tones. “At your convenience, Mr. Malfoy requests the favor of aconversation.”Harry did not choke on his breakfast cereal. Instead he turned aroundand beheld Mr. Crabbe.“Excuse me,” said Harry. “Don’t you mean ‘Da boss wants ta talk widyouse?’”Mr. Crabbe didn’t look happy. “Mr. Malfoy instructed me to speakproperly.”“I can’t hear you,” Harry said. “You’re not speaking properly.” Heturned back to his bowl of tiny blue crystal snowflakes and deliberatelyate another spoonful.“Da boss wants to talk with youse,” came a threatening voice frombehind him. “Ya’d better come see him if ya know what’s good for ya.”There. Now everything was going according to plan.407 *Act 1:“A reason?” said the old wizard. He restrained the fury from his face.The boy before him had been the victim, and certainly did not need to befrightened any further. “There is nothing that can excuse—”“What I did to him was worse.”The old wizard stiffened in sudden horror. “Harry, what have youdone?”“I tricked Draco into believing that I’d tricked him into participatingin a ritual that sacrificed his belief in blood purism. And that meant hecouldn’t be a Death Eater when he grew up. He’d lost everything, Headmaster.”There was a long quiet in the office, broken only by the tiny puffs andwhistles of the fiddly things, which after enough time had come to seemlike silence.“Dear me,” said the old wizard, “I do feel silly. And here I was expecting you might try to redeem the heir of Malfoy by, say, showing him truefriendship and kindness.”“Ha! Yeah, like that would have worked.”The old wizard sighed. This was taking it too far. “Tell me, Harry. Didit even occur to you that there was something incongruous about setting outto redeem someone through lies and trickery?”“I did it without telling any direct lies, and since we’re talking aboutDraco Malfoy here, I think the word you’re looking for is congruous.” Theboy looked rather smug.The old wizard shook his head in despair. “And this is the hero. We’reall doomed.”Act 5:The long, narrow tunnel of rough stone, unlit except by a child’s wand,seemed to stretch on for miles.The reason for this was simple: It did stretch on for miles.The time was three in the morning, and Fred and George were starting the long way down the secret passage that led from a statue of a oneeyed witch in Hogwarts, to the cellar of the Honeydukes candyshop inHogsmeade.“How’s it doing?” said Fred in a low voice.(Not that there’d be anyone listening, but there was something oddabout talking in a normal voice when you were going through a secretpassage.)“Still on the fritz,” said George.“Both, or—”“Intermittent one fixed itself again. Other one’s same as ever.”The Map was an extraordinarily powerful artifact, capable of trackingevery sentient being on the school grounds, in real time, by name. Almostcertainly, it had been created during the original raising of Hogwarts. Itwas not good that errors were starting to pop up. Chances were that noone except Dumbledore could fix it if it was broken.And the Weasley twins weren’t about to turn the Map over to Dumbledore. It would have been an unforgivable insult to the Marauders—thefour unknowns who’d managed to steal part of the Hogwarts security system, something probably forged by Salazar Slytherin himself, and twist itinto a tool for student pranking.Some might have considered it disrespectful.Some might have considered it criminal.The Weasley twins firmly believed that if Godric Gryffindor had beenaround to see it, he would have approved.The brothers walked on and on and on, mostly in silence. The Weasleytwins talked to each other when they were thinking through new pranks,or when one of them knew something the other didn’t. Otherwise therewasn’t much point. If they already knew the same information, theytended to think the same thoughts and make the same decisions.(Back in the old days, whenever magical identical twins were born, ithad been the custom to kill one of them after birth.)In time, Fred and George clambered out into a dusty cellar, strewnwith barrels and racks of strange ingredients.Fred and George waited. It wouldn’t have been polite to do anythingelse.Before too long a thin old man in black pajamas clambered downthe steps that led into the cellar, yawning. “Hello, boys,” said AmbrosiusFlume. “I wasn’t expecting you tonight. Out of stock already?”Fred and George decided that Fred would speak.“Not exactly, Mr. Flume,” said Fred. “We were hoping you could helpus with something considerably more… interesting.”“Now, boys,” said Flume, sounding severe, “I hope you didn’t wake meup just so I could tell you again that I’m not selling you any merchandisethat could get you into real trouble. Not until you’re sixteen, anyways—”George drew forth an item from his robes, and wordlessly passed it toFlume. “Have you seen this?” said Fred.Flume looked at yesterday’s edition of the Daily Prophet and nodded,scowling. The headline on the paper read THE NEXT DARK LORD? andshowed a young boy which some student’s camera had managed to catchin an uncharacteristically cold and grim expression.“I can’t believe that Malfoy,” Flume snapped. “Going after the boywhen he’s only eleven! The man ought to be ground up and used to makechocolates!”Fred and George blinked in unison. Malfoy was behind Rita Skeeter?Harry Potter hadn’t warned them about that… which surely meant thatHarry didn’t know. He never would have brought them in if he did…Fred and George exchanged glances. Well, Harry didn’t need to knowuntil after the job was done.“Mr. Flume,” Fred said quietly, “the Boy-Who-Lived needs your help.”Flume looked at them both.Then he let out his breath with a sigh.“All right,” said Flume, “what do you want?”410 *Act 6:When Rita Skeeter was intent on a tasty prey, she didn’t tend to noticethe scurrying ants who constituted the rest of the universe, which washow she almost bumped into the balding young man who’d stepped intoher pathway.“Miss Skeeter,” said the man, sounding rather severe and cold forsomeone whose face looked that young. “Fancy running into you here.”“Out of my way, buster!” snapped Rita, and tried to step around him.The man in her pathway matched the movement so perfectly that itwas like neither of them had moved at all, just stood still while the streetshifted around them.Rita’s eyes narrowed. “Who do you think you are?”“How very foolish,” the man said dryly. “It would have been wise tomemorize the face of the disguised Death Eater training Harry Potter tobe the next Dark Lord. After all,” a thin smile, “that certainly sounds likesomeone you wouldn’t want to run into on the street, especially after doing a hatchet job on him in the newspaper.”Rita took a moment to place the reference. This was Quirinus Quirrell?He looked too young and too old at the same time; his face, if it relaxedfrom its severe and condescending pose, would belong to someone in hislate thirties. And his hair was already falling out? Couldn’t he afford ahealer?No, that wasn’t important, she had a time and a place and a beetleto be. She’d just received an anonymous tip about Madam Bones making time with one of her younger assistants. That would be worth quitea bonus if she could manage to verify it, Bones was high on the hit list.The tipster had said that Bones and her young assistant were due to eatlunch in a special room at Mary’s Place, a very popular room for certainpurposes; a room which, she’d found, was secure against all listening devices, but not proof against a beautiful blue beetle nestled up against onewall…“Out of my way!” Rita said, and tried to push Quirrell from her path.Quirrell’s arm brushed her own, deflecting, and Rita staggered as thethrust went into the thin air.Quirrell pulled up the sleeve of his left robe, showing his left arm. “Observe,” said Quirrell, “no Dark Mark. I would like your paper to publish aretraction.”Rita let out an incredulous laugh. Of course the man wasn’t a realDeath Eater. The paper wouldn’t have published it if he was. “Forget it,buster. Now take a hike.”Quirrell stared at her for a moment.Then he smiled.“Miss Skeeter,” said Quirrell, “I had hoped to find some lever thatwould prove persuasive. Yet I find that I cannot deny myself the pleasureof simply crushing you.”“It’s been tried. Now get out of my way, buster, or I’ll find some Aurorsand have you arrested for obstruction of journalism.”Quirrell swept her a small bow, and then walked past. “Goodbye, RitaSkeeter,” said his voice from behind her.As Rita bulled on ahead, she noted in the back of her mind that theman was whistling a tune as he walked away.Like that would scare her.Act 4:“Sorry, count me out,” said Lee Jordan. “I’m more the giant spidertype.”The Boy-Who-Lived had said that he had important work for the Orderof Chaos, something serious and secret, more significant and difficultthan their usual run of pranks.And then Harry Potter had launched into a speech that was inspiring,yet vague. A speech to the effect that Fred and George and Lee hadtremendous potential if they could just learn to be weirder. To make people’s lives surreal, instead of just surprising them with the equivalents ofbuckets of water propped above doors. (Fred and George had exchangedinterested looks, they’d never thought of that one.) Harry Potter hadinvoked a picture of the prank they’d pulled on Neville—which, Harryhad mentioned with some remorse, the Sorting Hat had chewed him outon—but which must have made Neville doubt his own sanity. For Nevilleit would have felt like being suddenly transported into an alternateuniverse. The same way everyone else had felt when they’d seen Snapeapologize. That was the true power of pranking.Are you with me? Harry Potter had cried, and Lee Jordan had answeredno.“Count us in,” said Fred, or possibly George, for there was no doubtthat Godric Gryffindor would have said yes.Lee Jordan gave a regretful grin, and stood up, and left the desertedand Quieted corridor where the four members of the Order of Chaos hadmet and sat down in a conspiratorial circle.The three members of the Order of Chaos got down to business.(It wasn’t that sad. Fred and George would still work with Lee on giant spider pranks, same as ever. They’d only started calling it the Orderof Chaos in order to recruit Harry Potter, after Ron had told them aboutHarry being weird and evil, and Fred and George had decided to saveHarry by showing him true friendship and kindness. Thankfully this nolonger seemed necessary—although they weren’t quite sure about that…)“So,” said one of the twins, “what’s this about?”“Rita Skeeter,” said Harry. “Do you know who she is?”Fred and George nodded, frowning.“She’s been asking questions about me.”That wasn’t good news.“Can you guess what I want you to do?”Fred and George looked at each other, a bit puzzled. “You want us toslip her some of our more interesting candies?”“No,” said Harry. “No, no, no! That’s giant-spider thinking! Come on,what would you do if you heard that Rita Skeeter was looking for rumorsabout you?”That made it obvious.Grins slowly started on the faces of Fred and George.“Start rumors about ourselves,” they replied.“Exactly,” said Harry, grinning widely. “But these can’t be just any rumors. I want to teach people never to believe what the newspaper saysabout Harry Potter, any more than Muggles believe what the newspapersays about Elvis. At first I just thought about flooding Rita Skeeter withso many rumors that she wouldn’t know what to believe, but then she’lljust cherry-pick the ones that sound plausible and bad. So what I wantyou to do is create a fake story about me, and get Rita Skeeter to believe itsomehow. But it has to be something that, afterward, everyone will knowwas fake. We want to fool Rita Skeeter and her editors, and afterward havethe proof come out that it was false. And of course—given that those arethe requirements—the story has to be as ridiculous as it can possibly be,and still get printed. Do you understand what I want you to do?”“Not exactly…” Fred or George said slowly. “You want us to invent thestory?”“I want you to do all of it,” Harry Potter said. “I’m sort of busy rightnow, plus I want to be able to say truthfully that I had no idea what wascoming. Surprise me.”For a moment there was a very evil grin on the faces of Fred andGeorge.Then they turned serious. “But Harry, we don’t really know how to doanything like that—”“So figure it out,” Harry said. “I have confidence in you. Not total confidence, but if you can’t do it, tell me that, and I’ll try someone else, or do itmyself. If you have a really good idea—for both the ridiculous story, andhow to convince Rita Skeeter and her editors to print it—then you cango ahead and do it. But don’t go with something mediocre. If you can’tcome up with something awesome, just say so.”Fred and George exchanged worried glances.“I can’t think of anything,” said George.“Neither can I,” said Fred. “Sorry.”Harry stared at them.And then Harry began to explain how you went about thinking ofthings.It had been known to take longer than two seconds, said Harry.You never called any question impossible, said Harry, until you hadtaken an actual clock and thought about it for five minutes, by the motionof the minute hand. Not five minutes metaphorically, five minutes by aphysical clock.And furthermore, Harry said, his voice emphatic and his right handthumping hard on the floor, you did not start out immediately lookingfor solutions.Harry then launched into an explanation of a test done by someonenamed Norman Maier, who was something called an organizational psychologist, and who’d asked two different sets of problem-solving groupsto tackle a problem.The problem, Harry said, had involved three employees doing threejobs. The junior employee wanted to just do the easiest job. The senioremployee wanted to rotate between jobs, to avoid boredom. An efficiencyexpert had recommended giving the junior person the easiest job and thesenior person the hardest job, which would be 20% more productive.One set of problem-solving groups had been given the instruction “Donot propose solutions until the problem has been discussed as thoroughlyas possible without suggesting any.”The other set of problem-solving groups had been given no instructions. And those people had done the natural thing, and reacted to thepresence of a problem by proposing solutions. And people had gotten attached to those solutions, and started fighting about them, and arguingabout the relative importance of freedom versus efficiency and so on.The first set of problem-solving groups, the ones given instructionsto discuss the problem first and then solve it, had been far more likely tohit upon the solution of letting the junior employee keep the easiest joband rotating the other two people between the other two jobs, for whatthe expert’s data said would be a 19% improvement.Starting out by looking for solutions was taking things entirely out oforder. Like starting a meal with dessert, only bad.(Harry also quoted someone named Robyn Dawes as saying that theharder a problem was, the more likely people were to try to solve it immediately.)So Harry was going to leave this problem to Fred and George, and theywould discuss all the aspects of it and brainstorm anything they thoughtmight be remotely relevant. And they shouldn’t try to come up with anactual solution until they’d finished doing that, unless of course they didhappen to randomly think of something awesome, in which case theycould write it down for afterward and then go back to thinking. And hedidn’t want to hear back from them about any so-called failures to think ofanything for at least a week. Some people spent decades trying to think ofthings.“Any questions?” said Harry.Fred and George stared at each other.“I can’t think of any.”“Neither can I.”Harry coughed gently. “You didn’t ask about your budget.”Budget? they thought.“I could just tell you the amount,” Harry said. “But I think this will bemore inspiring.”Harry’s hands dipped into his robe, and brought forth—Fred and George almost fell over, even though they were sitting down.“Don’t spend it for the sake of spending it,” Harry said. On the stonefloor in front of them gleamed an absolutely ridiculous amount of money.“Only spend it if awesomeness requires; and what awesomeness does require, don’t hesitate to spend. If there’s anything left over, just return itafterward, I trust you. Oh, and you get ten percent of what’s there, regardless of how much you end up spending—”“We can’t!” blurted one of the twins. “We don’t accept money for thatsort of thing!”(The twins never took money for doing anything illegal. Unknownto Ambrosius Flume, they were selling all of his merchandise at zero percent markup. Fred and George wanted to be able to testify—under Veritaserum if necessary—that they had not been profiteering criminals, justproviding a public service.)Harry frowned at them. “But I’m asking you to put in some real workhere. A grownup would get paid for doing something like this, and itwould still count as a favor for a friend. You can’t just hire people for thissort of thing.”Fred and George shook their heads.“Fine,” Harry said. “I’ll just get you expensive Christmas presents, andif you try returning them to me I’ll burn them. Now you don’t even knowhow much I’m going to spend on you, except, obviously, that it’s goingto be more than if you’d just taken the money. And I’m going to buy youthose presents anyway, so think about that before you tell me you can’t thinkof anything awesome.”Harry stood up, smiling, and turned to go while Fred and George werestill gaping in shock. He strode a few steps away, and then turned back.“Oh, one last thing,” Harry said. “Leave Professor Quirrell out of whatever you do. He doesn’t like publicity. I know it’d be easier to get people tobelieve weird things about the Defense Professor than anyone else, andI’m sorry to have to get in your way like that, but please, leave ProfessorQuirrell out of it.”And Harry turned again and took a few more steps—Looked back one last time, and said, softly, “Thank you.”And left.There was a long pause after he’d departed.“So,” said one.“So,” said the other.“The Defense Professor doesn’t like publicity, does he.”“Harry doesn’t know us very well, does he.”“No, he doesn’t.”“But we won’t use his money for that, of course.”“Of course not, that wouldn’t be right. We’ll do the Defense Professorseparately.”“We’ll get some Gryffindors to write Skeeter, and say…”“…his sleeve lifted up one time in Defense class, and they saw the DarkMark…”“…and he’s probably teaching Harry Potter all sorts of dreadfulthings…”“…and he’s the worst Defense Professor anyone remembers even inHogwarts, he’s not just failing to teach us, he’s getting everything wrong,the complete opposite of what it should be…”“…like when he claimed that you could only cast the Killing Curse using love, which made it pretty much useless.”“I like that one.”“Thanks.”“I bet the Defense Professor likes it too.”“He does have a sense of humor. He wouldn’t have called us what hedid if he didn’t have a sense of humor.”“But are we really going to be able to do Harry’s job?”“Harry said to discuss the problem before trying to solve it, so let’s dothat.”The Weasley twins decided that George would be the enthusiastic onewhile Fred doubted.“It all seems sort of contradictory,” said Fred. “He wants it to be ridiculous enough that everyone laughs at Skeeter and knows it’s wrong, andhe wants Skeeter to believe it. We can’t do both things at the same time.”“We’ll have to fake up some evidence to convince Skeeter,” saidGeorge.“Was that a solution?” said Fred.They considered this.“Maybe,” said George, “but I don’t think we should be all that strictabout it, do you?”The twins shrugged helplessly.“So then the fake evidence has to be good enough to convince Skeeter,”said Fred. “Can we really do that on our own?”“We don’t have to do it on our own,” said George, and pointed to thepile of money. “We can hire other people to help us.”The twins got a thoughtful look on their face.“That could use up Harry’s budget pretty fast,” said Fred. “This is a lotof money for us, but it’s not a lot of money for someone like Flume.”“Maybe people will give discounts if they know it’s for Harry,” saidGeorge. “But most importantly of all, whatever we do, it has to be impossible.”Fred blinked. “What do you mean, impossible?”“So impossible that we don’t get in trouble, because no one believeswe could have done it. So impossible that even Harry starts wondering.It has to be surreal, it has to make people doubt their own sanity, it has tobe… better than Harry.”Fred’s eyes were wide in astonishment. This happened sometimes,between them, but not often. “But why?”“They were pranks. They were all pranks. The pie was a prank. TheRemembrall was a prank. Kevin Entwhistle’s cat was a prank. Snape wasa prank. We’re the best pranksters in Hogwarts, are we going to roll overand give up without a fight?”“He’s the Boy-Who-Lived,” said Fred.“And we’re the Weasley twins! He’s challenging us. He said we coulddo what he does. But I bet he doesn’t think we’ll ever be as good as him.”“He’s right,” said Fred, feeling rather nervous. The Weasley twins didsometimes disagree even when they had all the same information, but every time they did it seemed unnatural, like at least one of them must bedoing something wrong. “This is Harry Potter we’re talking about. He cando the impossible. We can’t.”“Yes we can,” said George. “And we have to be more impossible thanhim.”“But—” said Fred.“It’s what Godric Gryffindor would do,” said George.That settled it, and the twins snapped back into… whatever it was thatwas normal for them.“All right, then—”“—let’s think about it.”Quirrell’s office hours consisted of 11:40 to 11:55 am on ThursProfessorday. That was for all of his students in all years. It cost a Quirrellpoint just to knock on the door, and if he didn’t think your reason wasworth his time, you would lose another fifty.Harry knocked on the door.There was a pause. Then a biting voice said, “I suppose you may aswell come in, Mr. Potter.”And before Harry could touch the doorknob, the door slammed open,hitting the wall with a sharp crack that sounded like something mighthave broken in the wood, or the stone, or both.Professor Quirrell was leaning back in his chair and reading a suspiciously old-looking book, bound in night-blue leather with silver runes onthe spine. His eyes had not moved from the pages. “I am not in a goodmood, Mr. Potter. And when I am not a good mood, I am not a pleasantperson to be around. For your own sake, conduct your business quicklyand depart.”A cold chill seeped from the room, as though it contained somethingthat cast darkness the way lamps cast light, and which hadn’t been fullyshaded.Harry was a bit taken aback. Not in a good mood didn’t quite seem tocover it. What could be bothering Professor Quirrell this much…?Well, you didn’t just walk out on friends when they were feeling down.Harry cautiously advanced into the room. “Is there anything I can do tohelp—”“No,” said Professor Quirrell, still not looking up from the book.“I mean, if you’ve been dealing with idiots and want someone sane totalk to…”There was a surprisingly long pause.Professor Quirrell slammed the book shut and it vanished with a smallwhispering sound. He looked up, then, and Harry flinched.“I suppose an intelligent conversation would be pleasant for me at thispoint,” said Professor Quirrell in the same biting tone that had invitedHarry to enter. “You are not likely to find it so, be warned.”Harry drew a deep breath. “I promise I won’t mind if you snap at me.What happened?”The cold in the room seemed to deepen. “A sixth-year Gryffindor casta curse at one of my more promising students, a sixth-year Slytherin.”Harry swallowed. “What… sort of curse?”And the fury on Professor Quirrell’s face was no longer contained.“Why bother to ask an unimportant question like that, Mr. Potter? Ourfriend the sixth-year Gryffindor did not think it was important!”“Are you serious?” Harry said before he could stop himself.“No, I’m in a terrible mood today for no particular reason. Yes I’m serious, you fool! He didn’t know. He actually didn’t know. I didn’t believe ituntil the Aurors confirmed it under Veritaserum. He is in his sixth year atHogwarts and he cast a high-level Dark curse without knowing what it did.”“You don’t mean,” Harry said, “that he was mistaken about what it did,that he somehow read the wrong spell description—”“All he knew was that it was meant to be directed at an enemy. Heknew that was all he knew.”And that had been enough to cast the spell. “I do not understand howanything with that small a brain could walk upright.”“Indeed, Mr. Potter,” said Professor Quirrell.There was a pause. Professor Quirrell leaned forward and picked upthe silver inkwell from his desk, turning it around in his hands, staringat it as though wondering how he could go about torturing an inkwell todeath.“Was the sixth-year Slytherin seriously hurt?” said Harry.“Yes.”“Was the sixth-year Gryffindor raised by Muggles?”422 *“Yes.”“Is Dumbledore refusing to expel him because the poor boy didn’tknow?”Professor Quirrell’s hands whitened on the inkwell. “Do you have apoint, Mr. Potter, or are you just stating the obvious?”“Professor Quirrell,” said Harry gravely, “all the Muggle-raised students in Hogwarts need a safety lecture in which they are told the thingsso ridiculously obvious that no wizardborn would ever think to mentionthem. Don’t cast curses if you don’t know what they do, if you discoversomething dangerous don’t tell the world about it, don’t brew high-levelpotions without supervision in a bathroom, the reason why there are underage magic laws, all the basics.”“Why?” said Professor Quirrell. “Let the stupid ones die before theybreed.”“If you don’t mind losing a few sixth-year Slytherins along with them.”The inkwell caught fire in Professor Quirrell’s hands and burnedwith a terrible slowness, hideous black-orange flames tearing at themetal and seeming to take tiny bites from it, the silver twisting as itmelted, as though it were trying and failing to escape. There was a tinnyshrieking sound, as though the metal were screaming.“I suppose you are right,” Professor Quirrell said with a resignedsmile. “I shall design a lecture to ensure that Muggleborns who are toostupid to live do not take anyone valuable with them as they depart.”The inkwell went on screaming and burning in Professor Quirrell’shands, tiny droplets of metal, still on fire, now dripping to the desk, asthough the inkwell were crying.“You’re not running away,” observed Professor Quirrell.Harry opened his mouth—“If you’re about to say you’re not scared of me,” said Professor Quirrell,“don’t.”“You are the scariest person I know,” Harry said, “and one of the topreasons for that is your control. I simply can’t imagine hearing that you’dhurt someone you had not made a deliberate decision to hurt.”The fire in Professor Quirrell’s hands winked out, and he carefullyplaced the ruined inkwell on his desk. “You say the nicest things, Mr. Pot*423 *ter. Have you been taking lessons in flattery? From, perhaps, Mr. Malfoy?”Harry kept his expression blank, and realized one second too latethat it might as well have been a signed confession. Professor Quirrelldidn’t care what your expression looked like, he cared which states ofmind made it likely.“I see,” said Professor Quirrell. “Mr. Malfoy is a useful friend to have,Mr. Potter, and there is much he can teach you, but I hope you have notmade the mistake of trusting him with too many confidences.”“He knows nothing which I fear becoming known,” said Harry.“Well done,” said Professor Quirrell, smiling slightly. “So what wasyour original business here?”“I think I’m done with the preliminary exercises in Occlumency andready for the tutor.”Professor Quirrell nodded. “I shall conduct you to Gringotts this Sunday.” He paused, looking at Harry, and smiled. “And we might even makeit a little outing, if you like. I’ve just had a pleasant thought.”Harry nodded, smiling back.As Harry left the office, he heard Professor Quirrell humming a smalltune.Harry was glad he’d been able to cheer him up.That Sunday there seemed to be a rather large number of people whispering in the hallways, at least when Harry Potter walked past them.And a lot of pointed fingers.And a great deal of female giggling.It had started at breakfast, when someone had asked Harry if he’dheard the news, and Harry had quickly interrupted and said that if thenews was written by Rita Skeeter then he didn’t want to hear about it, hewanted to read it in the paper himself.It had then developed that not many students at Hogwarts got copiesof the Daily Prophet, and that the copies which had not already been424 *bought up from their owners were being passed around in some sort ofcomplicated order and nobody really knew who had one at the moment…So Harry had used a Quieting Charm and gone on to eat his breakfast,trusting to his seat-mates to wave off the many, many questioners, anddoing his best to ignore the incredulity, the laughter, the congratulatorysmiles, the pitying looks, the fearful glances, and the dropped plates asnew people came down for breakfast and heard.Harry was feeling rather curious, but it really wouldn’t have done tospoil the artistry by hearing it secondhand.He’d done homework in the safety of his trunk for the next couple ofhours, after telling his dormmates to come get him if anyone found himan original newspaper.Harry was still ignorant at 10am, when he’d left Hogwarts in a carriage with Professor Quirrell, who was in the front right, and currentlyslumped over in zombie-mode. Harry was sitting diagonally across, asfar away as the carriage allowed, in the back left. Even so, Harry had aconstant feeling of doom as the carriage rattled over a small path througha section of non-forbidden forest. It made it a bit hard to read, especiallysince the material was difficult, and Harry suddenly wished he was reading one of his childhood science fiction books instead—“We’re outside the wards, Mr. Potter,” said Professor Quirrell’s voicefrom the front. “Time to go.”Professor Quirrell carefully disembarked from the carriage, bracinghimself as he stepped down. Harry, on his own side, jumped off.Harry was wondering exactly how they’d get there when ProfessorQuirrell said “Catch!” and threw a bronze Knut at him, and Harry caughtit without thinking.A giant intangible hook caught at Harry’s abdomen and yanked himback, hard, only without any sense of acceleration, and an instant laterHarry was standing in the middle of Diagon Alley.(Excuse me, what? said his brain.)(We just teleported, explained Harry.)(That didn’t used to happen in the ancestral environment, Harry’s braincomplained, and disoriented him.)425 *Harry staggered as his feet adjusted to the brick of the street insteadof the dirt of the forest corridor they had been traversing. He straightened, still dizzy, with the bustling witches and wizards seeming to swayslightly, and the cries of the shopkeepers seeming to move around in hishearing, as his brain tried to place a world to be located in.Moments later, there was a sort of sucking-popping sound from a fewpaces behind Harry, and when Harry turned to look Professor Quirrellwas there.“Do you mind—” said Harry, at the same time as Professor Quirrellsaid, “I’m afraid I—”Harry stopped, Professor Quirrell didn’t.“—need to go off and set something in motion, Mr. Potter. As it hasbeen thoroughly explained to me that I am responsible for anything whatsoever that happens to you, I’ll be leaving you with—”“Newsstand,” Harry said.“Pardon?”“Or anywhere I can buy a copy of the Daily Prophet. Put me there andI’ll be happy.”Shortly after, Harry had been delivered into a bookstore, accompanied by several quietly spoken, ambiguous threats. And the shopkeeperhad gotten less ambiguous threats, judging by the way he had cringed,and how his eyes now kept darting between Harry and the entrance.If the bookstore burned down, Harry was going to stick around in themiddle of the fire until Professor Quirrell got back.Meanwhile—Harry took a quick glance around.The bookstore seemed rather small and shoddy, with only four rowsof bookcases visible, and the nearest shelf Harry’s eyes had jumped toseemed to deal with narrow, cheaply bound books with grim titles likeThe Massacre of Albania in the Fifteenth Century.First things first. Harry stepped over to the seller’s counter.“Pardon me,” said Harry, “One copy of the Daily Prophet, please.”“Five Sickles,” said the shopkeeper. “Sorry, kid, I’ve only got threeleft.”426 *Five Sickles dropped onto the counter. Harry had the feeling he couldhave bargained him down a couple of points, but at this point he didn’treally care.The shopkeeper’s eyes widened and he seemed to really notice Harryfor the first time. “You!”“Me!”“Is it true? Are you really—”“Shut up! Sorry, I’ve been waiting all day to read this in the originalnewspaper instead of hearing about it secondhand, so please just hand itover, all right?”The shopkeeper stared at Harry for a moment, then wordlesslyreached under the counter and passed over one folded copy of the DailyProphet.The headline read:Harry PotterSecretly BetrothedTo Ginevra WeasleyHarry stared.He lifted the newspaper off the counter, softly, reverently, like he washandling an original Escher artwork, and unbent it to read……about the evidence that had convinced Rita Skeeter.…and some interesting further details.…and yet more evidence.Fred and George had cleared it with their sister first, surely? Yes, ofcourse they had. There was a picture of Ginevra Weasley sighing longingly over what Harry could see, looking closely, was a photo of himself.That had to have been staged.But how on Earth…?Harry was sitting in a cheap folding chair, rereading the newspaperfor the fourth time, when the door whispered softly and Professor Quirrell came back into the shop.“My apologies for—what in Merlin’s name are you reading?”427 *“It would seem,” said Harry, awe in his voice, “that one Mr. ArthurWeasley was placed under the Imperius Curse by a Death Eater whommy father killed, thus creating a debt to House Potter, which my fatherdemanded be repaid by the hand in marriage of the recently born GinevraWeasley. Do people actually do that sort of thing around here?”“How could Miss Skeeter possibly be fool enough to believe—”And Professor Quirrell’s voice cut off.Harry had been reading the newspaper held vertically and unfolded,which meant that Professor Quirrell, from where he was standing, couldsee the text underneath the headline.The look of shock on Professor Quirrell’s face was a work of art almoston par with the newspaper itself.“Don’t worry,” said Harry cheerfully, “it’s all fake.”From elsewhere in the store, he heard the shopkeeper gasp. There wasthe sound of a stack of books falling over.“Mr. Potter…” Professor Quirrell said slowly, “are you sure of that?”“Quite sure. Shall we go?”Professor Quirrell nodded, looking rather abstracted, and Harryfolded the newspaper back up, and followed him out of the door.For some reason Harry didn’t seem to be hearing any street noisesnow.They walked in silence for thirty seconds before Professor Quirrellspoke. “Miss Skeeter viewed the original proceedings of the restrictedWizengamot session.”“Yes.”“The original proceedings of the Wizengamot.”“Yes.”“I would have trouble doing that.”“Really?” said Harry. “Because if my suspicions are correct, this wasdone by a Hogwarts student.”“That is beyond impossible,” Professor Quirrell said flatly. “Mr. Potter… I regret to say that this young lady expects to marry you.”“But that is improbable,” said Harry. “To quote Douglas Adams, theimpossible often has a kind of integrity which the merely improbablelacks.”428 *“I see your point,” Professor Quirrell said slowly. “But… no, Mr. Potter.It may be impossible, but I can imagine tampering with the Wizengamotproceedings. It is unimaginable that the Grand Manager of Gringottsshould affix the seal of his office in witness to a false betrothal contract,and Miss Skeeter personally verified that seal.”“Indeed,” said Harry, “you would expect the Grand Manager ofGringotts to get involved with that much money changing hands. Itseems Mr. Weasley was greatly in debt, and so demanded an additionalpayment of ten thousand Galleons—”“Ten thousand Galleons for a Weasley? You could buy the daughter of aNoble House for that!”“Excuse me,” Harry said. “I really have to ask at this point, do peopleactually do that sort of thing around here—”“Rarely,” said Professor Quirrell, with a frown on his face. “And not atall, I suspect, since the Dark Lord departed. I suppose that according tothe newspaper, your father just paid it?”“He didn’t have any choice,” said Harry. “Not if he wanted to fulfillthe conditions of the prophecy.”“Give me that,” said Professor Quirrell, and the newspaper leaped outof Harry’s hand so fast that he got a paper cut.Harry automatically put the finger in his mouth to suck on, feelingrather shocked, and turned to remonstrate with Professor Quirrell—Professor Quirrell had stopped short in the middle of the street, andhis eyes were flickering rapidly back and forth as an invisible force heldthe newspaper suspended before him.Harry watched, gaping in open awe, as the newspaper opened to reveal pages two and three. And not much long after, four and five. It waslike the man had cast off a pretense of mortality.And after a troublingly short time, the paper neatly folded itself upagain. Professor Quirrell plucked it from the air and tossed it to Harry,who caught it in sheer reflex; and then Professor Quirrell started walkingagain, and Harry automatically trudged after.“No,” said Professor Quirrell, “that prophecy didn’t sound quite rightto me either.”Harry nodded, still stunned.429 *“The centaurs could have been put under an Imperius,” ProfessorQuirrell said, frowning, “that seems understandable. What magic canmake, magic can corrupt, and it is not unthinkable that the Great Sealof Gringotts could be twisted to another’s hand. The Unspeakable couldhave been impersonated with Polyjuice, likewise the Bavarian seer. Andwith enough effort it might be possible to tamper with the proceedings ofthe Wizengamot. Do you have any idea how that was done?”“I do not have one single plausible hypothesis,” said Harry. “I do knowit was done on a total budget of forty Galleons.”Professor Quirrell stopped short and whirled on Harry. His expression was now completely incredulous. “Forty Galleons will pay acompetent ward-breaker to open a path into a home you wish to burglarize! Forty thousand Galleons might pay a team of the greatest professionalcriminals in the world to tamper with the proceedings of the Wizengamot!”Harry shrugged helplessly. “I’ll remember that the next time I wantto save thirty-nine thousand, nine hundred and sixty Galleons by findingthe right contractor.”“I do not say this often,” said Professor Quirrell. “I am impressed.”“Likewise,” said Harry.“And who is this incredible Hogwarts student?”“I’m afraid I couldn’t say.”Somewhat to Harry’s surprise, Professor Quirrell made no objectionto this.They walked in the direction of the Gringotts building, thinking, forthey were neither of them the sort of person who would give up on theproblem without considering it for at least five minutes.“I have a feeling,” Harry said finally, “that we’re coming at this fromthe wrong angle. There’s a tale I once heard about some students whocame into a physics class, and the teacher showed them a large metal platenear a fire. She ordered them to feel the metal plate, and they felt that themetal nearer the fire was cooler, and the metal further away was warmer.And she said, write down your guess for why this happens. So some students wrote down ‘because of how the metal conducts heat’, and somestudents wrote down ‘because of how the air moves’, and no one said ‘this430 *just seems impossible’, and the real answer was that before the studentscame into the room, the teacher turned the plate around.”“Interesting,” said Professor Quirrell. “That does sound similar. Isthere a moral?”“That your strength as a rationalist is your ability to be more confusedby fiction than by reality,” said Harry. “If you’re equally good at explaining any outcome, you have zero knowledge. The students thought theycould use words like ‘because of heat conduction’ to explain anything,even a metal plate being cooler on the side nearer the fire. So they didn’tnotice how confused they were, and that meant they couldn’t be moreconfused by falsehood than by truth. If you tell me that the centaurs wereunder the Imperius Curse, I still have the feeling of something being notquite right. I notice that I’m still confused even after hearing your explanation.”“Hm,” said Professor Quirrell.They walked on further.“I don’t suppose,” said Harry, “that it’s possible to actually swap peopleinto alternate universes? Like, this isn’t our own Rita Skeeter, or theytemporarily sent her somewhere else?”“If that was possible,” Professor Quirrell said, his voice rather dry,“would I still be here?”And just as they were almost to the huge white front of the Gringottsbuilding, Professor Quirrell said:“Ah. Of course. I see it now. Let me guess, the Weasley twins?”“What?” said Harry, his voice going up another octave in pitch. “How?”“I’m afraid I couldn’t say.”“…That is not fair.”“I think it is extremely fair,” said Professor Quirrell, and they enteredthrough the bronze doors.The time was just before noon, and Harry and Professor Quirrell wereseated at the foot and head of a wide, long, flat table, in a sumptuouslyappointed private room with thoroughly cushioned couches and chairsalong the walls, and soft curtains hanging everywhere.They were about to eat lunch in Mary’s Place, which Professor Quirrellhad said was known to him as one of the best restaurants in Diagon Alley,especially for—his voice had dropped meaningfully—certain purposes.It was the nicest restaurant that Harry had ever been in, and it wasreally eating away at Harry that Professor Quirrell was treating him tothe meal.The first part of the mission, to find an Occlumency instructor, hadbeen a success. Professor Quirrell, smiling evilly, had told Griphook torecommend the best he knew, and not worry about the expense, sinceDumbledore was paying it; and the goblin had smiled in return. Theremight have been a certain amount of smiling on Harry’s part as well.The second part of the plan had been a complete failure.Harry was not allowed to take money out of his vault without Headmaster Dumbledore or some other school official present, and ProfessorQuirrell had not been given the vault key. Harry’s Muggle parents couldnot authorize it because they were Muggles, and Muggles had around thesame legal standing as children or kittens: they were cute, so if you tortured them in public you could get arrested, but they weren’t people. Somereluctant provision had been made for recognizing the parents of Muggleborns as human in a limited sense, but Harry’s adoptive parents didnot fall into that legal category.It seemed that Harry was effectively an orphan in the eyes of thewizarding world. As such, the Headmaster of Hogwarts, or his designeeswithin the school system, were Harry’s guardians until he graduated.Harry could breathe without Dumbledore’s permission, but only so longas the Headmaster did not specifically prohibit it.Harry had then asked if he could simply tell Griphook how to diversifyhis investments beyond stacks of gold coins sitting in his vault.Griphook had stared blankly and asked what ‘diversify’ meant.Banks, it seemed, did not make investments. Banks stored your goldcoins in secure vaults for an annual fee.The wizarding world did not have a concept of stock. Or equity. Orcorporations. Businesses were run by families out of their personal432 *vaults.Loans were made by rich people, not banks. Though Gringotts wouldwitness the contract, for a fee, and enforce its collection, for a much largerfee.Good rich people let their friends borrow money and pay it back whenever. Bad rich people charged you interest.There was no secondary market in loans.Evil rich people charged you annual interest rates of at least 20%.Harry had stood up, turned away, and rested his head against the wall.Harry had asked if he needed the Headmaster’s permission before hecould start a bank.Professor Quirrell had interrupted at this point, saying that it wastime for lunch, and swiftly conducted a fuming Harry out of the bronzedoors of Gringotts, through Diagon Alley, and to a fine restaurant calledMary’s Place, where a room had been reserved for them. The owner hadlooked shocked at seeing Professor Quirrell accompanied by Harry Potter, but had conducted them to the room without complaint.And Professor Quirrell had quite deliberately announced that hewould pay the bill, seeming to rather enjoy the look on Harry’s face.“No,” said Professor Quirrell to the waitress, “we will not requiremenus. I will have the daily special accompanied by a bottle of Chianti,and Mr. Potter will have the Diracawl soup to start, followed by a plate ofRoopo balls, and treacle pudding for dessert.”The waitress, clad in robes that still looked severe and formal while being rather shorter than usual, bowed respectfully and departed, shuttingthe door behind her.Professor Quirrell waved a hand in the direction of the door, and a boltslid shut. “Note the bolt on the inside. This room, Mr. Potter, is known asMary’s Room. It happens to be proof against all scrying, and I do mean all;Dumbledore himself could detect nothing of what happens here. Mary’sRoom is used by two kinds of people. The first sort are engaged in illicitdalliances. And the second sort lead interesting lives.”“Really,” said Harry.Professor Quirrell nodded.433 *Harry’s lips were parted in anticipation. “It would be a waste to justsit here and eat lunch, then, without doing anything special.”Professor Quirrell grinned, then took out his wand and flicked it inthe direction of the door. “Of course,” he said, “people who lead interesting lives take precautions more thorough than the dalliers. I have justsealed us in. Nothing will now pass in or out of this room—through thecrack under the door, for example. And…”Professor Quirrell then spoke no fewer than four different Charms,none of which Harry recognized.“Even that does not really suffice,” said Professor Quirrell. “If we weredoing anything of truly great import, it would be necessary to performanother twenty-three checks besides those. If, say, Rita Skeeter knew orguessed that we would come here, it is possible that she could be in thisroom wearing the true Cloak of Invisibility. Or she could be an Animaguswith a tiny form, perhaps. There are tests to rule out such rare possibilities, but to perform all of them would be arduous. Still, I wonder if Ishould do them anyway, just so as not to teach you bad habits?” And Professor Quirrell tapped a finger on his cheek, looking abstracted.“It’s fine,” Harry said, “I understand, and I’ll remember.” Though hewas a little disappointed that they weren’t doing anything of truly greatimport.“Very well,” Professor Quirrell said. He leaned back in his chair, smiling broadly. “You wrought quite well today, Mr. Potter. The basic notionwas yours, I’m sure, even if you delegated the execution. I don’t thinkwe’ll be hearing much more from Rita Skeeter after this. Lucius Malfoywill not be pleased with her failure. If she’s smart, she’ll flee the countrythe instant she realizes she’s been fooled.”A sinking sensation began to dawn in Harry’s stomach. “Lucius wasbehind Rita Skeeter…?”“Oh, you didn’t realize that?” said Professor Quirrell.Harry hadn’t thought about what would happen to Rita Skeeter afterward.At all.Not in the slightest.434 *But she would get fired from her job, of course she would be fired, shemight have children going through Hogwarts for all Harry knew, andnow it was worse, much worse—“Is Lucius going to have her killed?” Harry said in a barely audiblevoice. Somewhere in his head, the Sorting Hat was screaming at him.Professor Quirrell smiled dryly. “If you have not dealt with journalistsbefore, take it from me that the world gets a little brighter every time onedies.”Harry jumped out of his chair with a convulsive movement, he had tofind Rita Skeeter and warn her before it was too late—“Sit down,” Professor Quirrell said sharply. “No, Lucius won’t kill her.But Lucius makes life extremely unpleasant for those who serve him ill.Miss Skeeter will flee and start her life over with a new name. Sit down,Mr. Potter; there is nothing you can do at this point, and you have a lessonto learn.”Harry sat down, slowly. There was a disappointed, annoyed look onProfessor Quirrell’s face that was doing more to stop him than the words.“There are times,” Professor Quirrell said, his voice cutting, “when Iworry that your brilliant Slytherin mind is simply wasted on you. Repeatafter me. Rita Skeeter was a vile, disgusting woman.”“Rita Skeeter was a vile, disgusting woman,” Harry said. He wasn’tcomfortable saying it, but there didn’t seem to be any other possible actions, none at all.“Rita Skeeter tried to destroy my reputation, but I executed an ingenious plan and destroyed her reputation first.”“Rita Skeeter challenged me. She lost the game, and I won.”“Rita Skeeter was an obstacle to my future plans. I had no choice butto deal with her if I wanted those plans to succeed.”“Rita Skeeter was my enemy.”“I cannot possibly get anything done in life if I am not willing to defeatmy enemies.”“I have defeated one of my enemies today.”“I am a good boy.”“I deserve a special reward.”435 *“Ah,” said Professor Quirrell, who had been grinning a benevolentsmile for the last few lines, “I see I have succeeded in catching your attention.”That was true. And while Harry felt like he was being railroaded intosomething—no, that wasn’t just a feeling, he had been railroaded—hecouldn’t deny that saying those things, and seeing Professor Quirrell’ssmile, did make him feel better.Professor Quirrell reached into his robes, the gesture slow and deliberately significant, and drew forth……a book.It was different from any book Harry had ever seen, the edges andcorners visibly misshapen; rough-hewn was the phrase that came to mind,like it had been hacked out of a book mine.“What is it?” breathed Harry.“A diary,” said Professor Quirrell.“Whose?”“That of a famous person.” Professor Quirrell was smiling broadly.“Okay…”Professor Quirrell’s expression became more serious. “Mr. Potter,one of the requisites for becoming a powerful wizard is an excellentmemory. The key to a puzzle is often something you read twenty yearsago in an old scroll, or a peculiar ring you saw on the finger of a man youmet only once. I mention this to explain how I managed to rememberthis item, and the placard attached to it, after meeting you a good deallater. You see, Mr. Potter, over the course of my life, I have viewed anumber of private collections held by individuals who are, perhaps, notquite deserving of all that they have—”“You stole it?” Harry said incredulously.“That is correct,” said Professor Quirrell. “Very recently, in fact. Ithink you will appreciate this particular item much more than the vilelittle man who held it for no other purpose than impressing his equallyvile friends with its rarity.”Harry was simply gaping now.“But if you feel that my actions were incorrect, Mr. Potter, I supposeyou needn’t accept your special present. Though of course I shan’t go to436 *the trouble of stealing it back. So which is it to be?”Professor Quirrell tossed the book from one hand to another, causingHarry to reach out involuntarily with a look of dismay.“Oh,” said Professor Quirrell, “don’t worry about a little rough handling. You could toss this diary in a fireplace and it would emerge unscathed. In any case, I await your decision.”Professor Quirrell casually threw the book up into the air and caughtit again, grinning.No, said Gryffindor and Hufflepuff.Yes, said Ravenclaw. What part of the word ‘book’ did you two not understand?The theft part, said Hufflepuff.Oh, come on, said Ravenclaw, you can’t seriously ask us to say no and spendthe rest of our life wondering what it was.It sounds like a net positive from a utilitarian standpoint, said Slytherin.Think of it as an economic transaction which generates gains from trade, onlywithout the trade part. Plus, we didn’t steal it and it won’t help anyone to haveProfessor Quirrell keep it.He’s trying to turn you Dark! shrieked Gryffindor, and Hufflepuff nodded firmly.Don’t be a naive little boy, said Slytherin, he’s trying to teach you Slytherin.Yeah, said Ravenclaw. Whoever owned the book originally was probably aDeath Eater or something. It belongs with us.Harry’s mouth opened, then halted that way, an agonized look on hisface.Professor Quirrell seemed to be quite enjoying himself. He had balanced the book on its corner, on one finger, and was keeping it uprightwhile humming a little tune.There came a knock at the door.The book vanished back into Professor Quirrell’s robes, and he roseup from his chair. Professor Quirrell started to walk over to the door——and staggered, suddenly lurching into the wall.437 *“It’s all right,” said Professor Quirrell’s voice, which suddenly soundeda lot weaker than usual. “Sit down, Mr. Potter, it’s just a dizzy spell. Sitdown.”Harry’s fingers gripped the edge of his chair, uncertain as to what heshould do, what he could do. Harry couldn’t even get too close to ProfessorQuirrell, not unless he wanted to defy that sense of Doom—Professor Quirrell straightened, then, his breathing seeming a bitheavy, and opened the door.The waitress came in, bearing a platter of food; and as she distributedthe plates, Professor Quirrell walked slowly back to the table.But by the time the waitress had bowed her way out, Professor Quirrell was sitting upright and smiling again.Still, the brief episode of whatever-it-was had decided Harry. Hecouldn’t say no, not after Professor Quirrell had gone to that muchtrouble.“Yes,” Harry said.Professor Quirrell held up a cautioning finger, then took out his wandagain, locked the door again, and repeated three of the same Charmsfrom earlier.Then Professor Quirrell took the book back out of his robes and tossedit to Harry, who almost dropped it into his soup.Harry shot Professor Quirrell a look of helpless indignation. Youweren’t supposed to do that with books, enchanted or not.Harry opened the book with ingrained, instinctive care. The pagesseemed too thick, with a texture unlike either Muggle paper or wizardingparchment. And the contents were……blank?“Am I supposed to be seeing—”“Look nearer the beginning,” said Professor Quirrell, and Harry(again with that helpless, ingrained care) turned a block of pages back.The lettering was obviously handwritten, and very hard to read, butHarry thought the words might be Latin.“What is this?” said Harry.“That,” said Professor Quirrell, “is a record of the magical researchesof a Muggleborn who never came to Hogwarts. He refused his letter, and438 *conducted his own small investigations, which never did get very far without a wand. From the description on the placard, I expect that his namebears rather more significance to you than to me. That, Harry Potter, isthe diary of Roger Bacon.”Harry almost fainted.Nestled up against the wall, where Professor Quirrell had stumbled,glistened the crushed remains of a beautiful blue beetle.439 *every day you got to see Harry Potter beg.It wasn’t“Pleeaaase,”whined Harry Potter.Fred and George shook their heads again, smiling.There was an agonized look on Harry Potter’s face. “But I told you howI did the one with Kevin Entwhistle’s cat, and Hermione and the vanishing soda, and I can’t tell you about the Sorting Hat or the Remembrall orProfessor Snape…”Fred and George shrugged and turned to leave.“If you ever do figure it out,” said the Weasley twins, “be sure to let usknow.”“You’re evil! You’re both evil!”Fred and George firmly closed the door to the empty classroom behind them, and made sure to keep the grin on their faces for a while, justin case Harry Potter could see through doors.Then they turned a corner and their faces sagged.“I don’t suppose Harry’s guesses—”“—gave you any ideas?” they said to each other at the same time, andthen their shoulders slumped further.Their last relevant memory was of Flume refusing to help them,though they couldn’t remember what they’d asked him to do……but they must have looked elsewhere and found someone to helpthem do something illegal, or they wouldn’t have agreed to be Obliviatedafterward.How had they possibly been able to get all that done on just fortyGalleons?At first they’d worried that they’d forged evidence so good that Harryactually would end up married to Ginny… but they’d thought of that too,it seemed. The Wizengamot proceedings had been tampered with againto put them back the way they’d been originally, the fake betrothal contract had vanished from its dragon-guarded vault in Gringotts, and so on.It was pretty scary, actually. Most people now thought the Daily Prophethad just made the whole thing up for unguessable reasons, and the Quibbler had helpfully twisted the knife deeper with the next day’s headline,Whoever they’d hired would tell them after the statute of limitationsexpired, they desperately hoped. But meanwhile it was awful, they’dpulled their greatest prank ever, maybe the greatest prank in the historyof pranking, and they couldn’t remember how. It was crazy, they’d beenable to think of a way the first time, so why couldn’t they see it now afterknowing everything they’d done?Their only consolation was that Harry didn’t know they didn’t know.Not even Mum had questioned them about it, despite the obviousWeasley connection. Whatever had been done, it was far out of thereach of any Hogwarts student… except possibly one, who, if certainrumors were true, might have done it by snapping his fingers. Harryhad been questioned under Veritaserum, he’d told them… with Dumbledore present and giving the Aurors scary looks. The Aurors had askedjust enough to determine that Harry hadn’t pulled the prank himself ordisappeared anyone, and then gotten the heck out of Hogwarts.Fred and George had wondered whether to feel insulted about HarryPotter being questioned by the Aurors for their prank, but the look onHarry’s face, probably for exactly the same reason, made everything worthit.Unsurprisingly, Rita Skeeter and the editor of the Daily Prophet hadboth vanished and were probably in another country by now. Theywould’ve liked to be able to tell their family about that part. Dad wouldhave congratulated them, they thought, after Mum had finished killingthem and Ginny had burned the remains.But everything was still all right, they’d tell Dad someday, and meanwhile…442 *…meanwhile Dumbledore had happened to sneeze while passingthem in the hallway, and a small package had accidentally dropped out ofhis pockets, and inside had been two matched wardbreaker’s monoclesof incredible quality. The Weasley twins had tested their new monocleson the “forbidden” third-floor corridor, making a quick trip to the magicmirror and back, and they hadn’t been able to see all the detection websclearly, but the monocles had shown a lot more than they’d seen the firsttime.Of course they would have to be very careful never to get caught withthe monocles in their possession, or they would end up in the Headmaster’s office getting a stern lecture and maybe even threats of expulsion.It was good to know that not everyone who got Sorted into Gryffindorgrew up to be Professor McGonagall.Harry was in a white room, windowless, featureless, sitting before a desk,facing an expressionless man in formal robes of solid black.The room was screened against detection, and the man had performed exactly twenty-seven spells before saying so much as “Hello,Mr. Potter.”It was oddly appropriate that the man in black was about to try reading Harry’s mind.“Prepare yourself,” the man said tonelessly.A human mind, Harry’s Occlumency book had said, was only exposedto a Legilimens along certain surfaces. If you failed to defend your surfaces, the Legilimens would go through and be able to access any part ofyou which their own mind was able to comprehend……which tended not to be much. Human minds, it seemed, were hardfor humans to understand on any level but the shallowest. Harry had wondered if knowing lots of cognitive science could make him an incrediblypowerful Legilimens, but repeated experience had finally driven into himthe lesson that he needed to get a little less excited in his anticipations443 *about this sort of thing. It wasn’t as if any cognitive scientist understoodhumans well enough to make one.To learn the counter, Occlumency, the first step was to imagine yourself to be a different person, pretending it as thoroughly as you could, immersing yourself entirely in that alternate persona. You wouldn’t alwayshave to do that, but in the beginning, it was how you learned where yoursurfaces were. The Legilimens would try to read you, and you would feelit happening if you paid close enough attention, you would sense themtrying to enter. And your job was to make sure that they always touchedyour imaginary persona and not the real one.When you were good enough at that, you could imagine being a verysimple sort of person, pretend to be a rock, and make a habit of leavingthe pretense in place where all your surfaces were. That was a standardOcclumency barrier. Pretending to be a rock was hard to learn, but easyto do afterward, and the exposed surface of a mind was much shallowerthan its interior, so with enough practice you could keep it up as a background habit.Or if you were a perfect Occlumens, you could race ahead of any probes,answering queries as fast as they were asked, so that the Legilimenswould enter through your surfaces and see a mind indistinguishablefrom whoever you were pretending to be.Even the best Legilimens could be fooled that way. If a perfect Occlumens claimed they were dropping their Occlumency barriers, there wasno way to know if they were lying. Worse, you might not know you weredealing with a perfect Occlumens. They were rare, but the fact that theyexisted meant you couldn’t trust Legilimency on anyone.It was a sad commentary on how little human beings understood eachother, how little any wizard comprehended the depths lying beneath themind’s surface, that you could fool the best human telepaths by pretending to be someone else.But then human beings only understood each other in the first placeby pretending. You didn’t make predictions about people by modelingthe hundred trillion synapses in their brain as separate objects. Ask thebest social manipulator on Earth to build you an Artificial Intelligencefrom scratch, and they’d just give you a dumb look. You predicted people444 *by telling your brain to act like theirs. You put yourself in their place. Ifyou wanted to know what an angry person would do, you activated yourown brain’s anger circuitry, and whatever that circuitry output, that wasyour prediction. What did the neural circuitry for anger actually look likeinside? Who knew? The best social manipulator on Earth might not knowwhat neurons were, and neither might the best Legilimens.Anything a Legilimens could understand, an Occlumens could pretendto be. It was the same trick either way—probably implemented by thesame neural circuitry in both cases, a single set of control circuits for reconfiguring your own brain to act as a model of someone else’s.And so the race between telepathic offense and telepathic defensehad been a decisive win for defense. Otherwise the entire magical world,maybe even the whole Earth, would have been a very different place…Harry took a deep breath, and concentrated. There was a slight smileon his face.For once, just once, Harry hadn’t gotten shortchanged in the mysterious powers department.After almost a month of work, and more on a whim than any realhunch, Harry had decided to make himself coldly angry and then try thebook’s Occlumency exercises again. At that point he’d mostly given uphope on that sort of thing, but it had still seemed worth a quick try—He’d run through all the book’s hardest exercises in two hours, andthe next day he’d gone and told Professor Quirrell he was ready.His dark side, it had turned out, was very, very good at pretending tobe other people.Harry thought of his standard trigger, from the first time he’d goneover entirely to his dark side…Severus paused, looking quite pleased with himself. “And that will be… fivepoints? No, let us make it an even ten points from Ravenclaw for backchat.”Harry’s smile grew chillier, and he regarded the black-robed man whothought he was going to read Harry’s mind.And then Harry turned into someone else entirely, someone who hadseemed appropriate to the occasion.…in a white room, windowless, featureless, sitting before a desk, facing an expressionless man in formal robes of solid black.445 *Kimball Kinnison regarded the black-robed man who thought he wasgoing to read the mind of a Second-Stage Lensman of the Galactic Patrol.To say that Kimball Kinnison was confident of the outcome would bean understatement. He had been trained by Mentor of Arisia, the mostpowerful mind known to this or any other universe, and the mere wizard sitting across from him would see precisely what the Gray Lensmanwanted him to see……the mind of the boy he was currently disguised as, an innocent childnamed Harry Potter.“I’m ready,” said Kimball Kinnison in nervous tones that were exactlyappropriate for an eleven-year-old boy.“Legilimens,” said the black-robed wizard.There was a pause.The black-robed wizard blinked, as if he’d seen something so shocking that it had been enough to make even his eyelids move. His voicewasn’t quite toneless as he said, “The Boy-Who-Lived has a mysterious darkside?”The heat slowly crept up into Harry’s cheeks.“Well,” the man said. His face had now settled back into perfect calm.“Excuse me. Mr. Potter, it is good to know your advantages, but that isnot the same as being wildly overconfident in them. You may indeed beable to learn Occlumency at eleven years of age. This astounds me. I hadthought Mr. Dumbledore was pretending to be insane again. Your dissociative talent is so strong that I am surprised to find no other signsof childhood abuse, and you may become a perfect Occlumens in time.But there is a considerable difference between that and expecting to putup a successful Occlumency barrier on your first attempt. That is merelyridiculous. Did you feel anything as I read your mind?”Harry shook his head, now blushing furiously.“Then pay closer attention next time. The goal is not to create a perfect image on your first day of lessons. The goal is to learn where yoursurfaces are. Prepare yourself.”Harry tried to pretend to be Kimball Kinnison again, tried to pay moreattention, but his thoughts were a little scattered and he was suddenlyaware of all the things he shouldn’t be thinking about…446 *Oh, this was going to suck.Harry gritted his teeth. At least the instructor would be Obliviatedafterward.“Legilimens.”There was a pause—…in a white room, windowless, featureless, sitting before a desk, facingan expressionless man in formal robes of solid black.It was their fourth day, on a Sunday evening. When you paid thismuch, you got your sessions any darned time you wanted, never mindthe concept of weekends.“Hello, Mr. Potter,” the telepath said tonelessly, having cast the fullsuite of privacy spells.“Hello, Mr. Bester,” Harry said wearily. “Let’s just get the initial shockout of the way, shall we?”“You managed to surprise me?” the man said, now sounding slightlyinterested. “Well then.” He pointed his wand and stared into Harry’s eyes.“Legilimens.”There was a pause, and then the black-robed wizard jerked as if someone had touched him with a cattle prod.“The Dark Lord is alive?” he choked. His eyes were suddenly wild.“Dumbledore turns himself invisible and sneaks into girls’ dorm rooms?”Harry sighed and looked down at his watch. In about another threeseconds…“So,” the man said. He hadn’t quite recovered his tonelessness. “Yougenuinely believe you’re going to discover the secret rules of magic andbecome all-powerful.”“That’s right,” Harry said evenly, still looking at his watch. “I’m thatoverconfident.”“I wonder. It seems the Sorting Hat thinks you’ll be the next DarkLord.”“And you know I’m trying pretty hard not to be, and you saw that wealready had a long discussion about whether you were willing to teach me447 *Occlumency, and in the end you decided to do it, so can we just get thisover with?”“All right,” said the man exactly six seconds later, same as last time.“Prepare yourself.” He paused, and then said, his voice rather wistful,“Though I do wish I could remember that trick with the gold and silver.”Harry was finding himself very disturbed by how reproducible human thoughts were when you reset people back to the same initial conditions and exposed them to the same stimuli. It was dispelling illusionsthat a good reductionist wasn’t supposed to have in the first place.Harry was in a rather bad mood as he stomped out of his Herbology classthe next Monday morning.Hermione was seething alongside him.The other children were still inside, a bit slow to assemble their thingsbecause they were gibbering excitedly to each other about Ravenclaw winning the year’s second Quidditch match.It seemed that last night after dinner, a girl had flown around ona broomstick for thirty minutes and then caught some sort of giantmosquito. There were other facts about what had happened during thismatch, but they were irrelevant.Harry had missed this exciting sports event due to his Occlumencylesson, and also having a life.He had then avoided all conversations in the Ravenclaw dorm,weren’t Quieting Charms and magical trunks wonderful. He had eatenbreakfast at the Gryffindor table.But Harry couldn’t avoid Herbology, and the Ravenclaws had talkedabout it before class, and after class, and during class, until Harry hadlooked up from the baby furcot whose diaper he was changing, andannounced loudly that some of them were trying to learn about plantsand Snitches didn’t grow on anything so could they all please shut up448 *about Quidditch. Everyone else present had given him shocked looks, except Hermione, who’d looked like she wanted to applaud, and ProfessorSprout, who had awarded him a point for Ravenclaw.A point for Ravenclaw.One point.The seven idiots on their idiot brooms playing their idiot game hadearned one hundred and ninety points for Ravenclaw.It seemed that Quidditch scores added directly onto the House points total.In other words, catching a golden mosquito was worth 150 Housepoints.Harry couldn’t even imagine what he would have to do to earn one hundred and fifty House points.Besides, y’know, rescuing a hundred and fifty Hufflepuffs, or coming upwith fifteen ideas as good as putting protective shells on time machines, or inventing one thousand five hundred creative ways to kill people, or being HermioneGranger for the entire year.“We should kill them,” Harry said to Hermione, who was walking beside him with an equally offended air.“Who?” said Hermione. “The Quidditch team?”“I was thinking of everyone involved in any way with Quidditch anywhere, but the Ravenclaw team would be a start, yes.”Hermione’s lips were pursed disapprovingly. “You do know thatkilling people is wrong, Harry?”“Yes,” Harry said.“Okay, just checking,” Hermione said. “Let’s get the Seeker first. I’veread some Agatha Christie mysteries, do you know how we can get heronto a train?”“Two students plotting murder,” said a dry voice. “How shocking.”From around a nearby corner strolled a man in lightly spotted robes,his greasy hair falling long and unkempt about his shoulders. Deadly danger seemed to radiate out from him, filling the hallway with improperlymixed potions and accidental falls and people dying in bed of what theAurors would rule to be natural causes.Without thinking about it at all, Harry stepped in front of Hermione.449 *There was an intake of breath from behind him, and then a momentlater Hermione brushed past and stepped in front of him. “Run, Harry!”she said. “Boys shouldn’t have to be in danger.”Severus Snape smiled mirthlessly. “Amusing. I request a moment ofyour time, Potter, if you can tear yourself away from your flirtations withMiss Granger.”Suddenly there was a very worried look on Hermione’s face. Sheturned to Harry and opened her mouth, then paused, looking distressed.“Oh, don’t worry, Miss Granger,” said Severus’s silky voice. “I promiseto return your beau unmaimed.” His smile vanished. “Now Potter and Iare about to go off and have a private conversation, just by ourselves. Ihope it is clear that you are not invited, but just in case, consider that anorder from a Hogwarts professor. I’m sure a good little girl like you won’tdisobey.”And Severus turned and walked back around the corner. “Coming,Potter?” his voice said.“Um,” Harry said to Hermione. “Can I just sort of go off and followhim and let you work out what I should say to make sure you’re not allworried and offended?”“No,” Hermione said, her voice trembling.Severus’s laughter echoed from around the corner.Harry bowed his head. “Sorry,” he said lowly, “really,” and he went offafter the Potions Master.“So,” Harry said. There were no other sounds now but two pairs of legs,the long and the short, padding across a random stone corridor. The Potions Master was striding quickly but not too fast for Harry to keep up,and insofar as Harry could apply the concept of directionality to Hogwarts, they were moving away from the frequented areas. “What’s thisabout?”“I don’t suppose you could explain,” Severus said dryly, “why the twoof you were plotting to murder Cho Chang?”450 *“I don’t suppose you could explain,” Harry said dryly, “in your capacity as an official of the Hogwarts school system, why catching a goldenmosquito is deemed an academic accomplishment worthy of a hundredand fifty House points?”A smile crossed Severus’s lips. “Dear me, and I thought you were supposed to be perceptive. Are you truly so incapable of understanding yourclassmates, Potter, or do you dislike them too much to try? If Quidditchscores did not count toward the House Cup then none of them would careabout House points at all. It would merely be an obscure contest for students like you and Miss Granger.”It was a shockingly good answer.And that shock brought Harry’s mind fully awake.In retrospect it shouldn’t have been surprising that Severus understood his students, understood them very well indeed.He had been reading their minds.And……the book said that a successful Legilimens was extremely rare, rarerthan a perfect Occlumens, because almost no one had enough mental discipline.Mental discipline?Harry had collected stories about a man who routinely lost his temperin class and blew up at young children.…but this same man, when Harry had spoken of the Dark Lord stillbeing alive, had responded instantly and perfectly—reacting in preciselythe way that someone completely ignorant would react.The man stalked about Hogwarts with the air of an assassin, radiatingdanger……which was exactly not what a real assassin should do. Real assassinsshould look like meek little accountants until they killed you.He was the Head of House for proud and aristocratic Slytherin, andhe wore a robe with spotted stains from bits of potions and ingredients,which two minutes of magic could have removed.Harry noticed that he was confused.And his threat estimate of the Head of House Slytherin shot up astronomically.Dumbledore had seemed to think Severus was his, and there’d beennothing to contradict that; the Potions Master had been “scary but notabusive”, as promised. So, Harry had reasoned earlier, this was Fellowship business. If Severus had been planning harm, surely he wouldn’thave come to get Harry in front of Hermione, a witness, when he couldhave simply waited for some time when Harry was alone…Harry quietly bit his lip.“I once knew a boy who truly adored Quidditch,” said Severus Snape.“He was an utter pillock. Just as you and I would expect, we two.”“What is this?” Harry said slowly.“Patience, Potter.”Severus turned his head, and then glided with his assassin’s bearinginto a nearby opening in the corridor walls, a smaller and narrower hallway leading off.Harry followed him, wondering if it would be smarter to simply runaway.They turned and made another turn, and came to a dead end, a simpleblank wall. If Hogwarts had actually been built, rather than conjured orsummoned or birthed or whatever, Harry would have had some sharpwords for the architect about paying people to build hallways that didn’tgo anywhere.“Quietus,” said Severus, and a few other things as well.Harry leaned back, folded his arms across his chest, and watchedSeverus’s face.“Looking me in the eyes, Potter?” said Severus Snape. “Your Occlumency lessons cannot have progressed far enough for you to block Legilimency. But then perhaps they have progressed far enough for you to detect it. Since I cannot know otherwise, I will not risk trying.” The mansmiled thinly. “And the same will hold for Dumbledore, I think. Which iswhy we are now having this little talk.”Harry’s eyes widened involuntarily.“To begin with,” Severus said, eyes glittering, “I should like you topromise not to speak of our conversations to anyone. So far as the schoolis concerned, we are discussing your Potions homework. Whether or notthey believe that is unimportant. So far as Dumbledore and McGonagall452 *are concerned, I am violating Draco Malfoy’s confidences in me, and neither of us think it proper to speak further of the particulars.”Harry’s brain tried to calculate the ramifications and implications ofthis and ran out of swap space.“Well?” said the Potions Master.“All right,” Harry said slowly. It was hard to see how having a conversation and being unable to tell anyone could be more constraining thannot having it, in which case you also couldn’t tell anyone the contents. “Ipromise.”Severus was watching Harry intently. “You said once in the Headmaster’s office that you would not tolerate bullying or abuse. And so I wonder,Harry Potter. Just how much do you resemble your father?”“Unless we’re talking about Michael Verres-Evans,” Harry said, “theanswer is that I know very little about James Potter.”Severus nodded, as though to himself. “There is a fifth-year Slytherin.A boy named Lesath Lestrange. He is being bullied by Gryffindors. I am…constrained, in my ability to deal with such situations. You could help him,perhaps. If you wished. I am not asking you for a favor, and will not oweyou one. It is simply an opportunity to do as you will.”Harry stared at Severus, thinking.“Wondering if it’s a trap?” said Severus, a faint smile crossing his lips.“It is not. It is a test. Call it curiosity on my part. But Lesath’s troubles arereal, as are my own difficulties in intervening.”That was the trouble with other people knowing you were a good guy.Even if you knew they knew, you still couldn’t ignore the bait.And if his father had protected students from bullies too… it didn’tmatter if Harry knew why Severus had told him. It still made him feelwarm inside, and proud, and made it impossible to walk away.“Fine,” Harry said. “Tell me about Lesath. Why is he being bullied?”Severus’s face lost the faint smile. “You think there are reasons, Potter?”“Perhaps not,” Harry said quietly. “But the thought had occurred tome that he might have pushed some unimportant mudblood girl downthe stairs.”453 *“Lesath Lestrange,” Severus said, his voice now cold, “is the son of Bellatrix Black, the most fanatic and evil servant of the Dark Lord. Lesath isthe acknowledged bastard of Rabastan Lestrange. Shortly after the DarkLord’s death, Bellatrix and Rabastan and Rabastan’s brother Rodolphuswere captured while torturing Alice and Frank Longbottom. All three arein Azkaban for life. The Longbottoms were driven insane by repeatedCruciatus and remain in St. Mungo’s incurable ward. Is any of that agood reason to bully him, Potter?”“It is no reason at all,” Harry said, still quietly. “And Lesath himselfhas done no wrong that you know?”The faint smile crossed Severus’s lips again. “He is no more a saintthan anyone else. But he has pushed no mudblood girls down the stairs,not that I ever heard.”“Or saw in his mind,” said Harry.Severus’s expression was chill. “I did not invade his privacy, Potter. Ilooked within the Gryffindors, rather. He is simply a convenient targetfor their little satisfactions.”A cold wash of anger ran down Harry’s spine, and he had to remindhimself that Severus might not be a trustworthy source of information.“And you think,” Harry said, “that an intervention by Harry Potter, theBoy-Who-Lived, might prove effective.”“Indeed,” said Severus Snape, and told Harry when and where theGryffindors were planning their next little game.There is a main hallway running through the middle of Hogwarts’s second floor on the north-south axis, and near the center of this hallwaythere is an opening into a short corridor which goes a dozen paces backbefore turning at a right angle, making an L-shape, and then goes a dozenpaces more before it ends at a bright, wide window, looking out fromthree stories above upon the light drizzle falling over the east groundsof Hogwarts. Standing by the window you can hear nothing of the main454 *hallway, and no one in the hallway would hear what went on by the window. If you think there is anything odd about this, you haven’t been inHogwarts very long.Four boys in red-trimmed robes are laughing, and a boy in greentrimmed robes is screaming and grabbing frantically onto the edges ofthe opened window with his hands, as the four boys make as though topush him out. It’s just a joke, of course, and besides, a fall from that heightwouldn’t kill a wizard. All good fun. If you think there is anything oddabout this—“What are you doing?” says a sixth boy’s voice.The four boys in red-trimmed robes spin around with sudden starts,and the boy in green-trimmed robes frantically pushes himself away fromthe window and falls to the floor, face streaked with tears.“Oh,” says the most handsome of the boys in red-trimmed robes,sounding relieved, “it’s you. Hey, Lessy, you know who this is?”There isn’t any answer from the boy on the floor, who’s trying to gethis sniffling under control, and the boy in the red-trimmed robes drawsback his leg for a kick—“Stop it!” shouts the sixth boy.The boy in the red-trimmed robes wobbles as he aborts the kick. “Um,”he says, “do you know who this is?”The sixth boy’s breathing sounds strange. “Lesath Lestrange,” he says,his breath coming in short pants, “and he didn’t do anything to my parents, he was five years old.”Neville Longbottom stared at the four huge fifth-year bullies in front ofhim, trying very hard to control his trembling.He should have just told Harry Potter no.“Why are you defending him?” said the handsome one, slowly, sounding puzzled with the first hints of offense. “He’s a Slytherin. And a Lestrange.”455 *“He’s a boy who lost his parents,” said Neville Longbottom. “I knowhow that is.” He didn’t know where the words had come from. It soundedtoo cool, like something Harry Potter would say.The trembling went on, though.“Who do you think you are?” said the handsome one, starting to soundangry.I am Neville, the last scion of the Noble and Most Ancient House ofLongbottom—Neville couldn’t say it.“I think he’s a traitor,” said one of the other Gryffindors, and there wasa sudden sinking sensation in Neville’s stomach.He’d known it, he’d just known it. Harry Potter had been wrong afterall. Bullies wouldn’t stop only because Neville Longbottom told them tostop.The handsome one took a step forward, and the three others followed.“So that’s how it is for you,” Neville said, amazed at how steady hisvoice was. “It doesn’t matter to you if it’s Lesath Lestrange or Neville Longbottom.”Lesath Lestrange let out a sudden gasp, from where he was lying onthe floor.“Evil is evil,” snarled the same boy who’d spoken before, “and if you’refriends with evil, you’re evil too.”The four took another step forward.Lesath rose, wobbling, to his feet. His face was gray, and he took a fewsteps forward, and leaned against the wall, and didn’t say anything. Hiseyes were fixed on the turn in the hallway, the way out.“Friends,” Neville said. Now his voice was going up a bit in pitch. “Yes,I have friends. One of them is the Boy-Who-Lived.”A couple of the Gryffindors looked suddenly worried. The handsomeone didn’t flinch. “Harry Potter isn’t here,” he said, his voice hard, “andif he was, I don’t think he’d like to see a Longbottom defending a Lestrange.”And the Gryffindors took another long step forward, and behindthem, Lesath crept along the wall, waiting for his chance.456 *Neville swallowed, and raised his right hand with his thumb and forefinger pressed together.He shut his eyes, because Harry Potter had made him promise not topeek.If this didn’t work, he was never trusting anyone again.His voice came out surprisingly clear, considering.“Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres. Harry James Potter-EvansVerres. Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres. By the debt that you owe meand the power of your true name I summon you, I open the way for you,I call upon you to manifest yourself before me.”Neville snapped his fingers.And then Neville opened his eyes.Lesath Lestrange was staring at him.The four Gryffindors were staring at him.The handsome one started to chuckle, and that set off the other three.“Was Harry Potter supposed to step around the corner or something?”said the handsome one. “Aw. Looks like you’ve been stood up.”The handsome one took a menacing step forward toward Neville.The other three followed in lockstep.“Ahem,” said Harry Potter from behind them, leaning against the wallby the window, in the dead end of the hallway, where nobody could possibly have gotten to without being seen.If watching people scream always felt this good, Neville could sort ofunderstand why people became bullies.Harry Potter stalked forward, placing himself between Lesath Lestrange and the others. He swept his icy gaze across the boys in redtrimmed robes, and then his eyes came to rest on the handsome one, theringleader. “Mr. Carl Sloper,” said Harry Potter. “I believe I have comprehended this situation fully. If Lesath Lestrange has ever committed asingle evil himself, rather than being born to the wrong parents, the factis not known to you. If I am mistaken in this, Mr. Sloper, I suggest youinform me at once.”Neville saw the fear and awe on the other boys’ faces. He was feelingit himself. Harry had claimed it would all be a trick, but how could it be?“But he’s a Lestrange,” said the ringleader.457 *“He’s a boy who lost his parents,” Harry Potter said, his voice growingeven colder.This time all three of the other Gryffindors flinched.“So,” said Harry Potter. “You saw that Neville didn’t want you tormenting an innocent boy on behalf of the Longbottoms. This failed tomove you. If I tell you that the Boy-Who-Lived also thinks you are in thewrong, that what you did today was a terrible mistake, does that make adifference?”The ringleader took a step toward Harry.The others did not follow him.“Carl,” one of them said, swallowing. “Maybe we should go.”“They say you’re going to be the next Dark Lord,” the ringleader said,staring at Harry.A grin crossed Harry Potter’s face. “They also say I’m secretly betrothed to Ginevra Weasley and there’s a prophecy about us conqueringFrance.” The smile faded. “Since you’re determined to force the issue,Mr. Carl Sloper, let me make things clear. Leave Lesath alone. I will knowif you don’t.”“So Lessy snarked to you,” said the ringleader coldly.“Sure,” said Harry Potter dryly, “and he also told me what you did today after you left Charms class, in a private secluded place where no onecould see you, with a certain Hufflepuff girl wearing a white ribbon in herhair—”The ringleader’s jaw dropped in shock.“Eep,” said one of the other Gryffindors in a high-pitched voice, andspun on his heels and ran around the corner. His footsteps rapidly pattered away and faded.And then there were six.“Ah,” said Harry Potter, “there goes a slightly intelligent young man.The rest of you could stand to learn from Bertram Kirke’s example, beforeyou get into, shall we say, trouble.”“Are you threatening to snark on us?” said the handsome Gryffindor,his voice trying to be angry, and rather wavering. “Bad things happen tosnarkers.”The other two Gryffindors started slowly moving back.458 *Harry Potter started laughing. “Oh, you did not just say that. Are youreally trying to intimidate me? Me? Now honestly, do you think you’rescarier than Peregrine Derrick, Severus Snape or for that matter YouKnow-Who?”Even the ringleader flinched at that.Harry Potter raised his hand, fingers poised, and all three of theGryffindors leaped backward, and one of them blurted “Don’t—!”“See,” said Harry Potter, “this is where I snap my fingers and youbecome part of a hilariously amusing story that will be told with muchnervous laughter at dinner tonight. But the thing is, people I trust keeptelling me not to do that. Professor McGonagall told me I was taking theeasy way out of everything and Professor Quirrell says I need to learn howto lose. So you remember that story where I let myself get beaten up bysome older Slytherins? We could do that. You could bully me for a whileand I could let you. Only you remember that part at the end where I tellmy many, many friends inside this school not to do anything about it?This time we’ll skip that part. So go ahead. Bully me.”Harry Potter stepped forward, his arms opened wide in invitation.The three Gryffindors broke and ran, and Neville had to sidestepquickly to avoid getting run over.There was silence, as their footsteps faded, and then more silence after that.And then there were three.Harry Potter drew a deep breath, then exhaled. “Whew,” he said.“How are you doing, Neville?”Neville’s voice came out in a high-pitched squeak. “Okay, that was really cool.”A grin flashed across Harry Potter’s face. “You were pretty cool too,you know.”Neville knew that Harry Potter was just saying that, trying to makehim feel good, and it still started a warm glow inside his chest.Harry turned toward Lesath Lestrange—“Are you okay, Lestrange?” said Neville before Harry could open hismouth.459 *Now there was something you didn’t expect to find yourself saying,ever.Lesath Lestrange turned slowly, and stared at Neville, his face tight,no longer crying, tears glistening as they dried.“You think you know how it is?” said Lesath, his voice high and shaking. “You think you know? My parents are in Azkaban, I try not to thinkabout it and they always remind me, they think it’s great that Mother isthere in the cold and the dark with the Dementors sucking away her life,I wish I was like Harry Potter, at least his parents aren’t hurting, my parents are always hurting, every second of every day, I wish I was like you,at least you can see your parents sometimes, at least you know they lovedyou, if Mother ever loved me the Dementors will have eaten that thoughtby now—”Neville’s eyes were wide with shock. He hadn’t expected this.Lesath turned to Harry Potter, whose eyes were full of horror.Lesath flung himself on the floor in front of Harry Potter, touched hisforehead to the ground, and whispered, “Help me, Lord.”There was an awful silence. Neville couldn’t think of a single thingto say, and from the naked shock on Harry’s face, he couldn’t think ofanything either.“They say you can do anything, please, please my Lord, get my parentsout of Azkaban, I’ll be your loyal servant forever, my life will be yours andmy death as well, only please—”“Lesath,” Harry said, his voice breaking, “Lesath, I can’t, I can’t reallydo things like that, it’s all just stupid tricks.”“It’s not!” said Lesath, his voice high and desperate. “I saw it, the stories are true, you can!”Harry swallowed. “Lesath, I set the whole thing up with Neville, weplanned it all out in advance, ask him!”They had, though Harry hadn’t said how he was going to do any of it…When Lesath looked up from the floor his face was ghastly, and hisvoice came out in a shriek that hurt Neville’s ears. “You son of a mudblood!You could get her out, you just won’t! I got down on my knees and begged you andyou still won’t help! I should have known, you’re the Boy-Who-Lived, you thinkshe belongs there!”460 *“I can’t!” Harry said, his voice as desperate as Lesath’s. “It’s not a question of what I want, I don’t have the power!”Lesath rose to his feet, and spat on the floor in front of Harry, and thenturned and walked away. When he was around the corner the sound ofhis feet sped up, and as they faded Neville thought he heard a single sob.And then there were two.Neville looked at Harry.Harry looked at Neville.“Wow,” Neville said quietly. “He didn’t seem very grateful for beingrescued.”“He thought I could help him,” Harry said, his voice hoarse. “He hadhope for the first time in years.”Neville swallowed, and said it. “I’m sorry.”“Wha?” said Harry, sounding totally confused.“I wasn’t grateful when you helped me—”“Every single thing you said before was completely right,” said theBoy-Who-Lived.“No,” Neville said, “it wasn’t.”They simultaneously gave brief sad smiles, each condescending to theother.“I know this wasn’t real,” said Neville, “I know I couldn’t have doneanything if you hadn’t been here, but thanks for letting me pretend.”“Give me a break,” said Harry.Harry had turned from Neville, and was staring out the window at thegloomy clouds.A completely ridiculous thought came to Neville. “Are you feelingguilty because you can’t get Lesath’s parents out of Azkaban?”“No,” said Harry.A few seconds went by.“Yes,” said Harry.“You’re silly,” said Neville.“I am aware of this,” said Harry.“Do you have to do literally anything anyone asks you?”The Boy-Who-Lived turned back and looked at Neville again. “Do? No.Feel guilty about not doing? Yes.”Neville was having trouble finding words. “Once the Dark Lord died,Bellatrix Black was literally the most evil person in the entire world andthat was before she went to Azkaban. She tortured my mother and fatherinto insanity because she wanted to find out what happened to the DarkLord—”“I know,” Harry said quietly. “I get that, but—”“No! You don’t! She had a reason for doing that, and my parentswere both Aurors! It’s not even close to the worst thing she’s ever done!”Neville’s voice was shaking.“Even so,” said the Boy-Who-Lived, his eyes distant as they staredoff into somewhere else, some other place that Neville couldn’t imagine.“There might be some incredibly clever solution that makes it possible tosave everyone and let them all live happily ever after, and if only I wassmart enough I would have thought of it by now—”“You have problems,” said Neville. “You think you ought to be whatLesath Lestrange thinks you are.”“Yeah,” said the Boy-Who-Lived, “that pretty much nails it. Every timesomeone cries out in prayer and I can’t answer, I feel guilty about notbeing God.”Neville didn’t quite understand that, but… “That doesn’t sound good.”Harry sighed. “I understand that I have a problem, and I know whatI need to do to solve it, all right? I’m working on it.”Harry watched Neville leave.Of course Harry hadn’t said what the solution was.The solution, obviously, was to hurry up and become God.Neville’s footsteps moved off, and soon could no longer be heard.And then there was one.“Ahem,” said Severus Snape’s voice from directly behind him.Harry let out a small scream and instantly hated himself.Slowly, Harry turned around.462 *The tall greasy man in the spotted robes was leaning against the wallin the same position Harry had occupied.“A fine invisibility cloak, Potter,” drawled the Potions Master. “Muchis explained.”Oh, bloody crap.“And perhaps I have been in Dumbledore’s company too long,” saidSeverus, “but I cannot help but wonder if that is the Cloak of Invisibility.”Harry immediately turned into someone who’d never heard of theCloak of Invisibility and who was exactly as smart as Harry thoughtSeverus thought Harry was.“Oh, possibly,” said Harry. “I trust you realize the implications, if itis?”Severus’s voice was condescending. “You have no idea what I’m talking about, do you, Potter? A rather clumsy try at fishing.”(Professor Quirrell had remarked over their lunch that Harry reallyneeded to conceal his state of mind better than putting on a blank facewhen someone discussed a dangerous topic, and had explained aboutone-level deceptions, two-level deceptions, and so on. So either Severuswas in fact modeling Harry as a one-level player, which made Severushimself two-level, and Harry’s three-level move had been successful; orSeverus was a four-level player and wanted Harry to think the deceptionhad been successful. Harry, smiling, had asked Professor Quirrell whatlevel he played at, and Professor Quirrell, also smiling, had responded,One level higher than you.)“So you were watching this whole time,” said Harry. “Disillusionment,I think it’s called.”A thin smile. “It would have been foolish of me to take the slightestrisk that you came to harm.”“And you wanted to see the results of your test firsthand,” said Harry.“So. Am I like my father?”A strange sad expression came over the man, one that looked foreignto his face. “I should sooner say, Harry Potter, that you resemble—”Severus stopped short.He stared at Harry.463 *“Lestrange called you a son of a mudblood,” Severus said slowly. “Itdidn’t seem to bother you much.”Harry furrowed his eyebrows. “Not under those circumstances, no.”“You’d just helped him,” Severus said. His eyes were intent on Harry.“And he threw it back in your face. Surely that isn’t something you’d justforgive?”“He’d just been through a pretty harrowing experience,” Harry said.“And I don’t think being rescued by first-years helped his pride much, either.”“I suppose it was easy enough to forgive,” Severus said, and his voicewas odd, “since Lestrange means nothing to you. Just some strangeSlytherin. If it was a friend, perhaps, you would have felt far moreinjured by what he said.”“If he were a friend,” Harry said, “all the more reason to forgive him.”There was a long silence. Harry felt, and he couldn’t have said why orfrom where, that the air was filling up with a dreadful tension, like waterrising, and rising, and rising.Then Severus smiled, looking suddenly relaxed once more, and all thetension vanished.“You are a very forgiving person,” Severus said, still smiling. “I suppose your stepfather, Michael Verres-Evans, was the one who taught it toyou.”“More like Dad’s science fiction and fantasy collection,” said Harry.“Sort of my fifth parent, really. I’ve lived the lives of all the characters in allmy books, and all their mighty wisdom thunders in my head. Somewherein there was someone like Lesath, I expect, though I couldn’t say who. Itwasn’t hard to put myself in his shoes. And it was my books that told mewhat to do about it, too. The good guys forgive.”Severus gave a light, amused laugh. “I’m afraid I wouldn’t know muchabout what good people do.”Harry looked at him. That was kind of sad, actually. “I’ll lend you somenovels with good people in them, if you like.”“I should like to ask your advice about something,” Severus said, hisvoice casual. “I know of another fifth-year Slytherin who was being bullied by Gryffindors. He was wooing a beautiful Muggleborn girl, who464 *came across him being bullied, and tried to rescue him. And he called hera mudblood, and that was the end for them. He apologized, many times,but she never forgave him. Have you any thoughts for what he could havesaid or done, to win from her the forgiveness you gave Lestrange?”“Erm,” Harry said, “based on only that information, I’m not sure hewas the main one who had a problem. I’d have told him not to date someone that incapable of forgiveness. Suppose they’d gotten married, canyou imagine life in that household?”There was a pause.“Oh, but she could forgive,” Severus said with amusement in his voice.“Why, afterward, she went off and became the girlfriend of the bully. Tellme, why would she forgive the bully, and not the bullied?”Harry shrugged. “At a wild guess, because the bully had hurt someoneelse very badly, and the bullied had hurt her just a little, and to her that justfelt far more unforgivable somehow. Or, not to put too fine a point on it,was the bully handsome? Or for that matter, rich?”There was another pause.“Yes to both,” said Severus.“And there you have it,” said Harry. “Not that I’ve ever been throughhigh school myself, but my books give me to understand that there’s acertain kind of teenage girl who’ll be outraged by a single insult if the boyis plain or poor, yet who can somehow find room in her heart to forgivea rich and handsome boy his bullying. She was shallow, in other words.Tell whoever it was that she wasn’t worthy of him and he needs to get overit and move on and next time date girls who are deep instead of pretty.”Severus stared at Harry in silence, his eyes glittering. The smile hadfaded, and though Severus’s face twitched, it did not return.Harry was starting to feel a bit nervous. “Um, not that I’ve got anyexperience in the area myself, obviously, but I think that’s what a wiseadviser from my books would say.”There was more silence and more glittering.It was probably a good time to change the subject.“So,” Harry said. “Did I pass your test, whatever it was?”“I think,” Severus said, “that there should be no more conversationsbetween us, Potter, and you would be exceedingly wise never to speak of465 *this one.”Harry blinked. “Would you mind telling me what I did wrong?”“You offended me,” said Severus. “And I no longer trust your cunning.”Harry stared at Severus, taken rather aback.“But you have given me well-meant advice,” said Severus Snape, “andso I will give you true advice in return.” His voice was almost perfectlysteady. Like a string stretched almost perfectly horizontal, despite themassive weight hanging from its middle, by a million tons of tensionpulling at either end. “You almost died today, Potter. In the future, nevershare your wisdom with anyone unless you know exactly what you areboth talking about.”Harry’s mind finally made the connection.“You were that—”Harry’s mouth snapped shut as the almost died part sank in, two seconds too late.“Yes,” said Severus, “I was.”And the terrible tension flooded back into the room like water pressurized at the bottom of the ocean.Harry couldn’t breathe.Lose. Now.“I didn’t know,” Harry whispered. “I’m s—”“No,” said Severus. Just that one word.Harry stood there in silence, his mind frantically searching for options. Severus stood between him and the window, which was a real pity,because a fall from that height wouldn’t kill a wizard.“Your books betrayed you, Potter,” said Severus, still in that voicestretched tight by a million tons of pull. “They did not tell you the onething you needed to know. You cannot learn from stories what it is liketo lose the one you love. That is something you could never understandwithout feeling it yourself.”“My father,” Harry whispered. It was his best guess, the one thing thatmight save him. “My father tried to protect you from the bullies.”A ghastly smile stretched across Severus’s face, and the man movedtoward Harry.466 *And past him.“Goodbye, Potter,” said Severus, not looking back on his way out. “Weshall have little to say to each other from today on.”And at the corner, the man stopped, and without turning, spoke onefinal time.“Your father was the bully,” said Severus Snape, “and what yourmother saw in him was something I never did understand until thisday.”He left.Harry turned and walked toward the window. His shaking handswent onto the ledge.Never give anyone wise advice unless you know exactly what you’re both talking about. Got it.Harry stared out at the clouds and the light drizzle for a while. Thewindow looked out on the east grounds, and it was afternoon, so if thesun was visible through the clouds at all, Harry couldn’t see it.His hands had stopped shaking, but there was a tight feeling inHarry’s chest, like it was being compressed by metal bands.So his father had been a bully.And his mother had been shallow.Maybe they’d grown up later. Good people like Professor McGonagalldid seem to think the world of them, and it might not be only because theywere heroic martyrs.Of course, that was scant consolation when you were eleven and aboutto turn into a teenager, and wondering what sort of teenager you mightbecome.So very terrible.So very sad.Such an awful life Harry led.Learning that his genetic parents hadn’t been perfect, why, he oughtto spend awhile moping about that, feeling sorry for himself.Maybe he could complain to Lesath Lestrange.Harry had read about Dementors. Cold and darkness surroundedthem, and fear, they sucked away all your happy thoughts and in that absence all your worst memories rose to the surface.467 *He could imagine himself in Lesath’s shoes, knowing that his parentswere in Azkaban for life, that place from which no one had ever escaped.And Lesath would be imagining himself in his mother’s place, in thecold and the darkness and the fear, alone with all of her worst memories,even in her dreams, every second of every day.For an instant Harry imagined his own Mum and Dad in Azkabanwith the Dementors sucking out their life, draining away the happy memories of their love for him. Just for an instant, before his imagination blewa fuse and called an emergency shutdown and told him never to imaginethat again.Was it right to do that to anyone, even the second most evil person inthe world?No, said the wisdom of Harry’s books, not if there’s any other way, anyother way at all.And unless the wizarding justice system was as perfect as theirprisons—and that sounded rather improbable, all things considered—somewhere in Azkaban was a person who was entirely innocent, andprobably more than one.There was a burning sensation in Harry’s throat, and moisture gathering in his eyes, and he wanted to teleport all of Azkaban’s prisoners tosafety and call down fire from the sky and blast that terrible place downto bedrock. But he couldn’t, because he wasn’t God.And Harry remembered what Professor Quirrell had said beneath thestarlight: Sometimes, when this flawed world seems unusually hateful, I wonderwhether there might be some other place, far away, where I should have been… Butthe stars are so very, very far away… And I wonder what I would dream about, ifI slept for a long, long time.Right now this flawed world seemed unusually hateful.And Harry couldn’t understand Professor Quirrell’s words, it mighthave been an alien that had spoken, or an Artificial Intelligence, something built along such different lines from Harry that his brain couldn’tbe forced to operate in that mode.You couldn’t leave your home planet while it still contained a placelike Azkaban.You had to stay and fight.468 *kay,” Harry said, swallowing. “Okay, Hermione, it’s enough, youcan stop.”The white sugar pill in front of Hermione still hadn’t changed shapeor color at all, even though she was concentrating harder than Harry hadever seen, her eyes squeezed shut, beads of sweat on her forehead, handtrembling as it gripped the wand—“Hermione, stop! It’s not going to work, Hermione, I don’t think wecan make things that don’t exist yet!”Slowly, Hermione’s hand relaxed its grasp on the wand.“I thought I felt it,” she said in a bare whisper. “I thought I felt it startto Transfigure, just for a second.”There was a lump in Harry’s throat. “You were probably imagining it.Hoping too hard.”“I probably was,” she said. She looked like she wanted to cry.Slowly, Harry took his mechanical pencil in his hand, and reachedover to the sheet of paper with all the items crossed out, and drew a linethrough the item that said ‘ALZHEIMER’S CURE’.They couldn’t have fed anyone a Transfigured pill. But Transfiguration, at least the kind they could do, didn’t enchant the targets—itwouldn’t Transfigure a regular broomstick into a flying one. So if Hermione had been able to make a pill at all, it would have been a nonmagicalpill, one that worked for ordinary material reasons. They could havesecretly made pills for a Muggle science lab, let them study the pills andtry to reverse-engineer them before the Transfiguration wore off… noone in either world would need to know that magic had been involved, itwould just be another scientific breakthrough…469 *It hadn’t been the sort of thing a wizard would think of, either. Theydidn’t respect mere patterns of atoms that much, they didn’t think of unenchanted material things as objects of power. If it wasn’t magical, it wasn’tinteresting.Earlier, Harry had very secretly—he hadn’t even told Hermione—tried to Transfigure nanotechnology a la Eric Drexler. (He’d tried toproduce a desktop nanofactory, of course, not tiny self-replicating assemblers, Harry wasn’t insane.) It would have been godhood in a singleshot if it’d worked.“That was it for today, right?” said Hermione. She was slumped backin her chair, leaning her head against the back; and her face showed hertiredness, which was very unusual for Hermione. She liked to pretendshe was limitless, at least when Harry was around.“One more,” Harry said cautiously, “but that one’s small, plus it mightactually work. I saved it for last because I was hoping we could end onan up note. It’s real stuff, not like phasers. They’ve already made it inthe laboratory, not like the Alzheimer’s cure. And it’s a generic substance,not specific like the lost books you tried to Transfigure copies of. I made adiagram of the molecular structure to show you. We just want to make itlonger than it’s ever been made before, and with all the tubes aligned, andthe endpoints embedded in diamond.” Harry produced a sheet of graphpaper.Hermione sat back up, took it, and studied it, frowning. “These areall carbon atoms? And Harry, what’s the name? I can’t Transfigure it if Idon’t know what it’s called.”Harry made a disgusted face. He was still having trouble getting usedto that sort of thing, it shouldn’t matter what something was named if youknew what it was. “They’re called buckytubes, or carbon nanotubes. It’s akind of fullerene that was discovered just this year. It’s about a hundredtimes stronger than steel and a sixth of the weight.”Hermione looked up from the graph paper, her face surprised. “That’sreal?”“Yeah,” Harry said, “just hard to make the Muggle way. If we couldget enough of the stuff, we could use it to build a space elevator all theway up to geosynchronous orbit or higher, and in terms of delta-v that’s470 *halfway to anywhere in the Solar System. Plus we could throw out solarpower satellites like confetti.”Hermione was frowning again. “Is this stuff safe?”“I don’t see why it wouldn’t be,” Harry said. “A buckytube is just agraphite sheet wrapped into a circular tube, basically, and graphite is thesame stuff used in pencils—”“I know what graphite is, Harry,” Hermione said. She brushed her hairback absentmindedly, her eyebrows furrowed as she stared at the sheetof paper.Harry reached into a pocket of his robes, and produced a white threadtied to two small gray plastic rings at either end. He’d added drops of superglue where the thread met either ring, to make it all a single objectthat could be Transfigured as a whole. Cyanoacrylate, if Harry remembered correctly, worked by covalent bonds, and that was as close to beinga “solid object” as you ever got in a world ultimately composed of tiny individual atoms. “When you’re ready,” Harry said, “try to Transfigure thisinto a set of aligned buckytube fibers embedded in two solid diamondrings.”“All right…” Hermione said slowly. “Harry, I feel like I just missedsomething.”Harry shrugged helplessly. Maybe you’re just tired. He knew better thanto say it out loud, though.Hermione laid her wand against one plastic ring, and stared for awhile.Two small circles of glittering diamond lay on the table, connected bya long black thread.“It changed,” said Hermione. She sounded like she was trying to beenthusiastic but had run out of energy. “Now what?”Harry felt a bit deflated by his research partner’s lack of passion, butdid his best not to show it; maybe the same process would work in reverseto cheer her up. “Now I test it to see if it holds weight.”There was an A-frame Harry had rigged up to do an earlier experiment with diamond rods—you could make solid diamond objects easily,using Transfiguration, they just wouldn’t last. The earlier experimenthad measured whether Transfiguring a long diamond rod into a shorterdiamond rod would allow it to lift a suspended heavy weight as it contracted, i.e., could you Transfigure against tension, which you in factcould.Harry carefully looped one circle of glittering diamond over the thickmetal hook at the top of the rig, then attached a thick metal hanger to thebottom ring, and then started attaching weights to the hanger.(Harry had asked the Weasley twins to Transfigure the apparatus forhim, and the Weasley twins had given him an incredulous look, like theycouldn’t figure out what sort of prank he could possibly want that for, butthey hadn’t asked any questions. And their Transfigurations, accordingto them, lasted for around three hours, so Harry and Hermione still hada while left.)“One hundred kilograms,” Harry said about a minute later. “I don’tthink a steel thread this thin would hold that. It should go up muchhigher, but that’s all the weight I’ve got.”There was a further silence.Harry straightened up, and went back to their table, and sat downin his chair, and ceremoniously made a check mark next to ‘Buckytubes’.“There,” Harry said. “That one worked.”“But it’s not really useful, Harry, is it?” Hermione said from where shewas sitting with her head resting in her hands. “I mean, even if we gaveit to a scientist they couldn’t learn how to make lots of buckytubes fromstudying ours.”“They might be able to learn something,” Harry said. “Hermione, lookat it, that little tiny thread holding up all that weight, we just made something that no Muggle laboratory could make—”“But any other witch could make it,” Hermione said. Her exhaustionwas coming into her voice, now. “Harry, I don’t think this is working out.”“You mean our relationship?” Harry said. “Great! Let’s break up.”That got a slight grin out of her. “I mean our research.”“Oh, Hermione, how could you?”“You’re sweet when you’re mean,” she said. “But Harry, this is nuts,I’m twelve, you’re eleven, it’s silly to think we’re going to discover anything that no one’s ever figured out before.”472 *“Are you really saying we should give up on unraveling the secrets ofmagic after trying for less than one month?” Harry said, trying to put anote of challenge into his voice. Honestly he was feeling some of the samefatigue as Hermione. None of the good ideas ever worked. He’d made justone discovery worth mentioning, the Mendelian pattern, and he couldn’ttell Hermione about it without breaking his promise to Draco.“No,” Hermione said. Her young face was looking very serious andadult. “I’m saying right now we should be studying all the magic that wizards already know, so we can do this sort of thing after we graduate fromHogwarts.”“Um…” Harry said. “Hermione, I hate to put it this way, but imaginewe’d decided to hold off on research until later, and the first thing we triedafter we graduated was Transfiguring an Alzheimer’s cure, and it worked.We’d feel… I don’t think the word stupid would adequately describe howwe’d feel. What if there’s something else like that and it does work?”“That’s not fair, Harry!” Hermione said. Her voice was trembling likeshe was on the verge of breaking out crying. “You can’t put that on people!It’s not our job to do that sort of thing, we’re kids!”For a moment Harry wondered what would happen if someone toldHermione she had to fight an immortal Dark Lord, if she would turn intoone of the whiny self-pitying heroes that Harry could never stand readingabout in his books.“Anyway,” Hermione said. Her voice shook. “I don’t want to keep doing this. I don’t believe children can do things that grownups can’t, that’sonly in stories.”There was silence in the classroom.Hermione started to look a little scared, and Harry knew that his ownexpression had gotten colder.It might not have hurt so much if the same thought hadn’t alreadycome to Harry—that, while thirty might be old for a scientific revolutionary and twenty about right, while there were people who got doctorates when they were seventeen and fourteen-year-old heirs who’d beengreat kings or generals, there wasn’t really anyone who’d made the history books at eleven.473 *“All right,” Harry said. “Figure out how to do something a grownupcan’t. Is that your challenge?”“I didn’t mean it like that,” Hermione said, her voice coming out in afrightened whisper.With an effort, Harry wrenched his gaze away from Hermione. “I’mnot angry at you,” Harry said. His voice was cold, despite his best efforts.“I’m angry at, I don’t know, everything. But I’m not willing to lose, Hermione. Losing isn’t always the right thing to do. I’ll figure out how to dosomething a grown wizard can’t do, and then I’ll get back to you. How’sthat?”There was more silence.“Okay,” said Hermione, her voice wavering a little. She pushed herselfup out of her chair, and went over to the door of the abandoned classroomthey’d been working in. Her hand went onto the doorknob. “We’re stillfriends, right? And if you can’t figure out anything—”Her voice halted.“Then we’ll study together,” Harry said. His voice was even coldernow.“Um, bye for now, then,” Hermione said, and she quickly went out ofthe room and shut the door behind her.Sometimes Harry hated having a dark side, even when he was insideit.And the part of him that had thought exactly the same thing as Hermione, that no, children couldn’t do what grownups couldn’t, was saying allthe things that Hermione had been too frightened to say, like, That’s onehell of a difficult challenge you just grabbed for yourself and boy are you goingto end up with egg on your face this time and at least this way you’ll know you’vefailed.And the part of him that didn’t enjoy losing replied, in a very coldvoice, Fine, you can shut up and watch.474 *It was almost lunchtime, and Harry didn’t care. He hadn’t even botheredgrabbing a snack bar from his pouch. His stomach could stand a littlestarving.The wizarding world was tiny, they didn’t think like scientists, theydidn’t know science, they didn’t question what they’d grown up with, theyhadn’t put protective shells on their time machines, they played Quidditch, all of magical Britain was smaller than a small Muggle city, thegreatest wizarding school only educated up to the age of seventeen, sillywasn’t challenging that at eleven, silly was assuming wizards knew whatthey were doing and had already exhausted all the low-hanging fruit ascientific polymath would see.Step One had been to make a list of every magical constraint Harrycould remember, all the things you supposedly couldn’t do.Step Two, mark the constraints that seemed to make the least sensefrom a scientific perspective.Step Three, prioritize constraints that a wizard would be unlikely toquestion if they didn’t know science.Step Four, come up with avenues for attacking them.Hermione still felt a little shaky as she sat down next to Mandy at theRavenclaw table. Hermione’s lunch had two fruits (tomato slices andpeeled tangerines), three vegetables (carrots, carrots, and more carrots),one meat (fried Diricawl drumsticks whose unhealthy coating she wouldcarefully remove), and one little piece of chocolate cake that she wouldearn by eating the other parts.It hadn’t been as bad as Potions class, sometimes she still had nightmares about that. But this time she had made it happen and she’d felt like itstarget. Just for a moment, before the terrible cold darkness looked awayand said it wasn’t angry with her, because it hadn’t wanted to scare her.And she still had that feeling like she’d missed something earlier,something really important.475 *But they hadn’t violated any of the rules of Transfiguration… had they?They hadn’t made any liquids, any gases, they hadn’t taken orders fromthe Defense Professor…The pill! That had been something to be eaten!…well, no, nobody would just eat a pill lying around, it hadn’t workedactually, they could have just Finite Incantatemed it if it had, but she wouldstill have to tell Harry about that and make sure they didn’t mention it infront of Professor McGonagall, in case they were never allowed to studyTransfiguration again…Hermione was starting to get a really sick feeling in her stomach. Shepushed back her plate from the table, she couldn’t eat lunch like this.And she closed her eyes and began to mentally recite the rules ofTransfiguration.“I will never Transfigure anything into liquid or gas.”“I will never Transfigure anything that looks like food or anything else thatgoes inside a human body.”No, they really shouldn’t have tried to Transfigure the pill, or theyshould’ve at least realized… she’d been so caught up in Harry’s brilliantidea that she hadn’t thought…The sick feeling in Hermione’s stomach was getting worse. There wasa feeling in her mind of something hovering just on the edge of recognition, a perception about to invert itself, a young woman about to becomea crone, a vase about to become two faces…And she went on remembering the rules of Transfiguration.Harry’s knuckles had gone white on his wand by the time he stopped trying to Transfigure the air in front of his wand into a paperclip. It wouldn’thave been safe to Transfigure the paperclip into gas, of course, but Harrydidn’t see any reason why it would be unsafe the other way around. It justwasn’t supposed to be possible. But why not? Air was as real a substanceas anything else…476 *Well, maybe that limitation did make sense. Air was disorganized, allthe molecules constantly changing their relation to each other. Maybeyou couldn’t impose a new form on substance unless the substance wasstaying still long enough for you to master it, even though the atoms insolids were also constantly vibrating all the time…The more Harry failed, the colder he felt, the clearer everythingseemed to become.All right. Next on the list.You could only Transfigure whole objects as wholes. You couldn’tTransfigure half a match into a needle, you had to Transfigure the wholething. Back when Harry had been trapped in that classroom by Draco, ithad been the reason he couldn’t just Transfigure a thin cylindrical crosssection of the walls into sponge, and punch out a chunk of stone largeenough for him to fit through the hole. He would have needed to imposea new form on the whole wall, and maybe a whole section of Hogwarts,just in order to change that little cross-section.And that was ridiculous.Things were made of atoms. Lots of little tiny dots. There was no contiguity, there was no solidity, just electromagnetic forces holding the littledots related to each other…Mandy Brocklehurst paused with her fork on her way to her mouth.“Huh,” she said to Su Li, sitting across from the now-empty space besideher, “what got into Hermione?”Harry wanted to kill his eraser.He’d been trying to change a single spot on the pink rectangle intosteel, apart from the rest of the rubber, and the eraser wasn’t cooperating.It had to be a conceptual limitation, not a real one. Had to be.477 *Things were made of atoms, and every atom was a tiny separate thing.Atoms were held together by a quantum mist of shared electrons, for covalent bonds, or sometimes just magnetism at close ranges, for ionic bondsor van der Waals forces.If it came down to that, the protons and neutrons inside the nucleiwere tiny separate things. The quarks inside the protons and neutronswere tiny separate things! There simply wasn’t anything in reality, theworld-out-there, that corresponded to people’s conceit of solid objects. Itwas all just little dots.And free Transfiguration was all in the mind to begin with, wasn’tit? No words, no gestures. Only the pure concept of form, kept strictlyseparate from substance, imposed on the substance, conceived of apartfrom its form. That and the wand and whatever made you a wizard.The wizards couldn’t transform parts of things, could only transformwhat their minds perceived as wholes, because they didn’t know in theirbones that it was all just atoms deep down.Harry had focused on that knowledge as hard as he could, the true factthat the eraser was just a collection of atoms, everything was just collections of atoms, and the atoms of the little patch he was trying to Transfigure formed just as valid a collection as any other collection he cared tothink about.And Harry still hadn’t been able to change that single part of theeraser, the Transfiguration wasn’t going anywhere.This. Was. Ridiculous.Harry’s knuckles were whitening on his wand again. He was sick ofgetting experimental results that didn’t make sense.Maybe the fact that some part of his mind was still thinking in termsof objects was stopping the Transfiguration from going through. He hadthought of a collection of atoms that was an eraser. He had thought of acollection that was a little patch.Time to kick it up a notch.Harry pressed his wand harder against that tiny section of eraser, andtried to see through the illusion that nonscientists thought was reality,the world of desks and chairs, air and erasers and people.478 *When you walked through a park, the immersive world that surrounded you was something that existed inside your own brain as apattern of neurons firing. The sensation of a bright blue sky wasn’tsomething high above you, it was something in your visual cortex, andyour visual cortex was in the back of your brain. All the sensations of thatbright world were really happening in that quiet cave of bone you calledyour skull, the place where you lived and never, ever left. If you reallywanted to say hello to someone, to the actual person, you wouldn’t shaketheir hand, you’d knock gently on their skull and say “How are you doingin there?” That was what people were, that was where they really lived.And the picture of the park that you thought you were walking throughwas something that was visualized inside your brain as it processed thesignals sent down from your eyes and retina.It wasn’t a lie like the Buddhists thought, there wasn’t something terribly mystical and unexpected behind the veil of Maya, what lay beyondthe illusion of the park was just the actual park, but it was all still illusion.Harry wasn’t sitting inside the classroom.He wasn’t looking at the eraser.Harry was inside Harry’s skull.He was experiencing a processed picture his brain had decoded fromthe signals sent down by his retina.The real eraser was somewhere else, somewhere that wasn’t the picture.And the real eraser wasn’t like the picture Harry’s brain had of it. Theidea of the eraser as a solid object was something that existed only insidehis own brain, inside the parietal cortex that processed his sense of shapeand space. The real eraser was a collection of atoms held together byelectromagnetic forces and shared covalent electrons, while nearby, airmolecules bounced off each other and bounced off the eraser-molecules.The real eraser was far away, and Harry, inside his skull, could neverquite touch it, could only imagine ideas about it. But his wand had thepower, it could change things out there in reality, it was only Harry’s ownpreconceptions that were limiting it. Somewhere beyond the veil of Maya,the truth behind Harry’s concept of “my wand” was touching the collectionof atoms that Harry’s mind thought of as “a patch on the eraser”, and if479 *that wand could change the collection of atoms that Harry considered“the whole eraser”, there was absolutely no reason why it couldn’t changethe other collection too…The Transfiguration still wasn’t going through.Harry’s teeth clenched together, and he kicked it up another notch.The concept Harry’s mind had of the eraser as a single object was obvious nonsense.It was a map that didn’t and couldn’t match the territory.Human beings modeled the world using stratified levels of organization, they had separate thoughts about how countries worked, how peopleworked, how organs worked, how cells worked, how molecules worked,how quarks worked.When Harry’s brain needed to think about the eraser, it would thinkabout the rules that governed erasers, like “erasers can get rid of pencilmarks”. Only if Harry’s brain needed to predict what would happen onthe lower chemical level, only then would Harry’s brain start thinking—as though it were a separate fact—about rubber molecules.But that was all in the mind.Harry’s mind might have separate beliefs about rules that governederasers, but there was no separate law of physics that governed erasers.Harry’s mind modeled reality using multiple levels of organization,with different beliefs about each level. But that was all in the map, thetrue territory wasn’t like that, reality itself had only a single level of organization, the quarks, it was a unified low-level process obeying mathematically simple rules.Or at least that was what Harry had believed before he’d found outabout magic, but the eraser wasn’t magical.And even if the eraser had been magical, the idea that there could really exist a single solid eraser was impossible. Things like erasers couldn’t bebasic elements of reality, they were too big and complicated to be atoms,they had to be made of parts. You couldn’t have things that were fundamentally complicated. The implicit belief that Harry’s brain had in the eraseras a single object wasn’t just wrong, it was a map-territory confusion, theeraser only existed as a separate concept in Harry’s multi-level model ofthe world, not as a separate element of single-level reality.…the Transfiguration still wasn’t happening.Harry was breathing heavily, failed Transfiguration was almost as tiring as successful Transfiguration, but damned if he’d give up now.All right, screw this nineteenth-century garbage.Reality wasn’t atoms, it wasn’t a set of tiny billiard balls boppingaround. That was just another lie. The notion of atoms as little dots wasjust another convenient hallucination that people clung to because theydidn’t want to confront the inhumanly alien shape of the underlyingreality. No wonder, then, that his attempts to Transfigure based on thathadn’t worked. If he wanted power, he had to abandon his humanity, andforce his thoughts to conform to the true math of quantum mechanics.There were no particles, there were just clouds of amplitude in a multiparticle configuration space and what his brain fondly imagined to be an eraserwas nothing except a gigantic factor in a wavefunction that happened tofactorize, it didn’t have a separate existence any more than there was aparticular solid factor of 3 hidden inside the number 6, if his wand wascapable of altering factors in an approximately factorizable wavefunction thenit should damn well be able to alter the slightly smaller factor that Harry’sbrain visualized as a patch of material on the eraser—Hermione tore through the hallways, shoes pounding hard on the stone,breath coming in pants, the shock of adrenaline still racing through herblood.Like a picture of a young woman turning into an old crone, like thecup becoming two faces.What had they been doing?What had they been doing?She came to the classroom and her fingers slipped on the doorknobat first, too sweaty, she grabbed harder and the door opened——in a single flash of perception she saw Harry staring at a small pinkrectangle on the table in front of him——as a few paces away the tiny black thread, almost invisible from thisdistance, supported all that weight—“Harry get out of the classroom!”Pure shock crossed Harry’s face, and he stood up so fast he almost fellover, stopping only to grab the small pink rectangle from the table, andhe tore out of the door, she’d already stepped aside, her wand was alreadyin her hand coming up pointing at the thread—“Finite Incantatem!”And Hermione slammed the door shut again, just as the giganticcrash of a hundred kilograms of falling metal came from inside.She was panting, gasping for air, she’d run all the way here withoutstopping, she was soaked in sweat and her legs and thighs burned likeliving flames, she couldn’t have answered Harry’s questions for all theGalleons in the world.Hermione blinked, and realized that she had started to fall, and Harryhad caught her, and was lowering her gently to sit on the floor.“…healthy…” she managed to whisper.“What?” said Harry, looking paler than she’d ever seen him.“…are you, feeling, healthy…”Harry started looking even more frightened as the question sank in.“I, I don’t think I have any symptoms—”Hermione closed her eyes for a moment. “Good,” she whispered.“Catch, breath.”That took a while. Harry was still looking scared. That was good too,maybe it would teach him a lesson.Hermione reached into the pouch Harry had bought her, whispered“water” through her parched throat, took out the bottle and drank in greathuge gulps.And then it was still a while before she could talk again.“We broke the rules, Harry,” she said in a hoarse voice. “We broke therules.”“I…” Harry swallowed. “I still don’t see how, I’ve been thinking but—”“I asked if the Transfiguration was safe and you answered me!”There was a pause.“That’s it?” Harry said.482 *She could have screamed.“Harry, don’t you get it?” she said. “It’s made out of tiny fibers, whatif it unraveled, who knows what could go wrong, we didn’t ask Professor McGonagall! Don’t you see what we were doing? We were experimenting withTransfiguration. We were experimenting with Transfiguration!”There was another pause.“Right…” Harry said slowly. “That’s probably one of those things theydon’t even bother telling you not to do because it’s too obvious. Don’t testbrilliant new ideas for Transfiguration by yourselves in an unused classroom without consulting any professors.”“You could have gotten us killed, Harry!” Hermione knew it wasn’tfair, she’d made the mistake too, but she still felt angry at him, he alwayssounded so confident and that had dragged her unthinkingly along in hiswake. “We could have spoiled Professor McGonagall’s perfect record!”“Yes,” said Harry, “let’s not tell her about this, shall we?”“We have to stop,” Hermione said. “We have to stop this or we’re going to get hurt. We’re too young, Harry, we can’t do this, not yet.”A weak grin crossed Harry’s face. “Um, you’re sort of wrong aboutthat.”And he held out a small pink rectangle, a rubber eraser with a brightmetal patch on it.Hermione stared at it, puzzled.“Quantum mechanics wasn’t enough,” Harry said. “I had to go all theway down to timeless physics before it took. Had to see the wand as enforcing a relation between separate past and future realities, instead ofchanging anything over time—but I did it, Hermione, I saw past the illusion of objects, and I bet there’s not a single other wizard in the worldwho could have. Even if some Muggleborn knew about timeless formulations of quantum mechanics, it would just be a weird belief about strangedistant quantum stuff, they wouldn’t see that it was reality, accept that theworld they knew was just a hallucination. I Transfigured part of the eraserwithout changing the whole thing.”Hermione raised her wand again, pointed it at the eraser.For a moment anger crossed Harry’s face, but he didn’t make anymove to stop her.483 *“Finite Incantatem,” said Hermione. “Check with Professor McGonagall before you try it again.”Harry nodded, though his face was still a bit tight.“And we still have to stop,” said Hermione.“Why?” said Harry. “Don’t you see what this means, Hermione? Wizards don’t know everything! There’s too few of them, even fewer whoknow any science, they haven’t exhausted the low-hanging fruit—”“It’s not safe,” Hermione said. “If we can find out new things it’s evenless safe! We’re too young! We made one big mistake already, next timewe could just die!”Then Hermione flinched.Harry looked away from her, and started taking slow, deep breaths.“Please don’t try to do it alone, Harry,” Hermione said, her voice trembling. “Please.”Please don’t make me have to decide whether to tell Professor Flitwick.There was a long pause.“So you want us to study,” Harry said. She could tell he was trying tokeep the anger out of his voice. “Just study.”Hermione wasn’t sure if she should say anything, but… “Like you studied, um, timeless physics, right?”Harry looked back at her.“That thing you did,” Hermione said, her voice tentative, “it wasn’tbecause of our experiments, right? You could do it because you’d readlots of books.”Harry opened his mouth, and then he shut it again. There was a frustrated look on his face.“All right,” Harry said. “How about this. We study, and if I think ofanything that seems really worth trying, we’ll try it after I ask a professor.”“Okay,” Hermione said. She didn’t fall over with relief, but only because she was already sitting down.“Shall we get lunch?” Harry said cautiously.Hermione nodded. Yes. Lunch sounded good. For real, this time.She carefully began to push herself off the stone floor, wincing as herbody screamed at her—Harry pointed his wand at her and said “Wingardium Leviosa.”484 *Hermione blinked as the huge weight on her legs diminished to something bearable.A smile quirked across Harry’s face. “You can lift something withoutbeing able to Hover it completely,” he said. “Remember that experiment?”Hermione smiled back helplessly, although she thought she ought tostill be angry.And she started walking back toward the Great Hall, feeling remarkably and wonderfully light on her feet, as Harry carefully kept his wandtrained on her.He only managed to keep it up for five minutes, but it was the thoughtthat counted.Minerva looked at Dumbledore.Dumbledore gazed back inquiringly at her. “Did you understand anyof that?” the Headmaster said, sounding bemused.It had been the most complete and utter gibberish that Minerva couldever remember hearing. She was feeling a bit embarrassed about havingsummoned the Headmaster to hear it, but she’d been given explicit instructions.“I’m afraid not,” Professor McGonagall said primly.“So,” Dumbledore said. The silver beard swung away from her, the oldwizard’s twinkling gaze looked elsewhere once more. “You suspect youmight be able to do something that other wizards can’t do, something wethink is impossible.”The three of them stood within the Headmaster’s private Transfiguration workroom, where the shining phoenix of Dumbledore’s Patronushad told her to bring Harry, moments after her own Patronus hadreached him. Light shone down through the skylights and illuminatedthe great seven-pointed alchemical diagram drawn in the center of thecircular room, showing it to be a little dusty, which saddened Minerva.Transfiguration research was one of Dumbledore’s great enjoyments,and she’d known how pressed for time he’d been lately, but not that hewas this pressed.485 *And now Harry Potter was going to waste even more of the Headmaster’s time. But she certainly couldn’t blame Harry for that. He’d donethe proper thing in coming to her to say that he’d had an idea for doingsomething in Transfiguration that was currently believed to be impossible, and she herself had done exactly what she’d been told to do: she’dordered Harry to be quiet and not discuss anything with her until shehad consulted the Headmaster and they’d finished moving to a secure location.If Harry had started out by saying what specifically he thought he coulddo, she wouldn’t have bothered.“Look, I know it’s hard to explain,” Harry said, sounding a little embarrassed. “What it adds up to is that what you believe conflicts with whatscientists believe, in a case where I’d genuinely expect scientists to knowmore than wizards.”Minerva would have sighed out loud, if Dumbledore hadn’t seemedto be taking the whole thing very seriously.Harry’s idea stemmed from simple ignorance, nothing more. If youchanged half of a metal ball into glass, the whole ball had a different Form.To change the part was to change the whole, and that meant removingthe whole Form and replacing it with a different one. What would it evenmean to Transfigure only half of a metal ball? That the metal ball as a wholehad the same Form as before, but half that ball now had a different Form?“Mr. Potter,” said Professor McGonagall, “what you want to do isn’tjust impossible, it’s illogical. If you change half of something, you didchange the whole.”“Indeed,” said Dumbledore. “But Harry is the hero, so he may be ableto do things that are logically impossible.”Minerva would have rolled her eyes, if she hadn’t gone numb a longtime ago.“Supposing it was possible,” said Dumbledore, “can you think of anyreason why the results would differ in any way from ordinary Transfiguration?”Minerva frowned. The fact that the concept was literally unimaginable was presenting her with some difficulty, but she tried to take it atface value. A Transfiguration imposed on only half of a metal ball…486 *“Strange things happening at the interface?” said Minerva. “But thatshould be no different than Transfiguring the object as a whole, into aForm with two different parts…”Dumbledore nodded. “That is my own thought as well. And Harry, ifyour theory is correct, it implies that what you want to do is exactly like anyother Transfiguration, only applied to a part of the subject rather than thewhole? No changes at all?”“Yes,” Harry said firmly. “That’s the whole point.”Dumbledore looked at her again. “Minerva, can you think of any reason whatsoever why that would be dangerous?”“No,” said Minerva, after she had finished searching through hermemory.“Likewise myself,” said the Headmaster. “All right, then, since thisought to be exactly analogous to ordinary Transfiguration in all respects,and since we cannot think of any reason whatsoever why it would be dangerous, I think that the second degree of caution will suffice.”Minerva was surprised, but she didn’t object. Dumbledore was by farher senior in Transfiguration, and he had tried literally thousands of newTransfigurations without ever choosing a degree of caution that was toolow. He had used Transfiguration in combat and he was still alive. If theHeadmaster thought the second degree was enough, it was enough.That Harry was certainly going to fail was, of course, completely irrelevant.The two of them started setting up the wards and detection webs. Themost important web was the one that checked to make sure no Transfigured material had entered the air. Harry would be enclosed in a separate shell of force with its own air supply just to be certain, only hiswand allowed to leave the shield, and the interface tight. They were inside Hogwarts so they couldn’t automatically Apparate out any materialthat showed signs of spontaneous combustion, but they could launch itout a skylight almost as fast, the windows all folded outward for exactlythat reason. Harry himself would go out a different skylight at the firstsign of trouble.Harry watched them working, his face looking a little frightened.487 *“Don’t worry,” said Professor McGonagall in the middle of her running description, “this almost certainly won’t be necessary, Mr. Potter. Ifwe expected anything to go wrong you would not be allowed to try. It’sjust ordinary precautions for any Transfiguration no one has ever triedbefore.”Harry swallowed and nodded.And a few minutes later, Harry was strapped into the safety chair andresting his wand against a metal ball—one that, based on his current testscores, should have been too large for him to Transfigure in less thanthirty minutes.And a few minutes after that, Minerva was leaning against the wall,feeling faint.There was a small patch of glass on the ball where Harry’s wand hadrested.Harry didn’t say I told you so, but the smug look on his sweating facesaid it for him.Dumbledore was casting analytic Charms on the ball, looking moreand more intrigued by the moment. Thirty years had melted off his face.“Fascinating,” said Dumbledore. “It’s exactly as he claimed. He simply Transfigured a part of the subject without Transfiguring the whole.You say it’s really just a conceptual limitation, Harry?”“Yes,” Harry said, “but a deep one, just knowing it had to be a conceptual limitation wasn’t enough. I had to suppress the part of my mind thatwas making the error and think instead about the underlying reality thatscientists figured out.”“Truly fascinating,” Dumbledore said. “I take it that for any other wizard to do the same would require months of study if they could do it at all?And may I ask you to partially Transfigure some other subjects?”“Probably yes and of course,” Harry said.Half an hour later, Minerva was feeling equally bewildered, but considerably reassured about the safety issues.It was the same, aside from being logically impossible.“I believe that’s enough, Headmaster,” Minerva said finally. “I suspectpartial Transfiguration is more tiring than the ordinary sort.”488 *“Getting less so with practice,” said the exhausted and pale boy, voiceunsteady, “but yeah, you’ve got that right.”The process of extracting Harry from the wards took another minute,and then Minerva escorted him to a much more comfortable chair, andDumbledore produced an ice-cream soda.“Congratulations, Mr. Potter!” said Professor McGonagall, and meantit. She would have bet almost anything against that working.“Congratulations indeed,” said Dumbledore. “Even I did not makeany original discoveries in Transfiguration before the age of fourteen.Not since the day of Dorotea Senjak has any genius flowered so early.”“Thanks,” Harry said, sounding a little surprised.“Nonetheless,” Dumbledore said thoughtfully, “I think it would bemost wise to keep this happy event a secret, at least for now. Harry,did you discuss your idea with any other person before you spoke toProfessor McGonagall?”There was silence.“Um…” Harry said. “I don’t want to turn anyone over to the Inquisition, but I did tell one other student—”The word almost exploded from Professor McGonagall’s lips. “What?You discussed a completely novel form of Transfiguration with a studentbefore consulting a recognized authority? Do you have any idea how irresponsible that was?”“I’m sorry,” said Harry. “I didn’t realize.”The boy looked appropriately frightened, and Minerva felt somethinginside her relax. At least Harry understood how foolish he’d been.“You must swear Miss Granger to secrecy,” Dumbledore said gravely.“And do not tell anyone else unless there is an extremely good reason forit, and they too have sworn.”“Ah… why?” Harry said.Minerva was wondering the same thing. Once again the Headmasterwas thinking too far ahead for her to keep up.“Because you can do something that no one else will believe you cando,” Dumbledore said. “Something completely unexpected. It may proveto be your critical advantage, Harry, and we must preserve it. Please, trustme in this.”489 *Professor McGonagall nodded, her firm face showing nothing of herinner confusion. “Please do, Mr. Potter,” she said.“All right…” Harry said slowly.“Once we have finished examining your materials,” Dumbledoreadded, “you may practice partial Transfiguration, on glass to steel andsteel to glass only, with Miss Granger to act as your spotter. Naturally,if either of you suspect any symptom of any form of Transfigurationsickness, inform a professor at once.”Just before Harry left the workroom, with his hand on the doorhandle,the boy turned back and said, “As long as we’re here, have either of younoticed anything different about Professor Snape?”“Different?” said the Headmaster.Minerva didn’t let her wry smile show on her face. Of course the boywas apprehensive about the ‘evil Potions Master’, since he had no way ofknowing why Severus was to be trusted. It would have been odd to say theleast, explaining to Harry that Severus was still in love with his mother.“I mean, has his behavior changed recently in any way?” said Harry.“Not that I have seen…” the Headmaster said slowly. “Why do youask?”Harry shook his head. “I don’t want to prejudice your own observations by saying. Just keep an eye out, maybe?”That sent a quiver of unease through Minerva in a way that no outright accusation of Severus could have.Harry bowed to both of them respectfully, and took his leave.“Albus,” Minerva said after the boy had gone, “how did you know to takeHarry seriously? I would have thought his idea merely impossible!”The old wizard’s face turned grave. “The same reason it must be keptsecret, Minerva. The same reason I told you to come to me, if Harry madeany such claim. Because it is a power that Voldemort knows not.”The words took a few seconds to sink in.And then the cold shiver went down her spine, as it always did whenshe remembered.It had started out as an ordinary job interview, Sybill Trelawney applying for the position of Professor of Divination.The one with the power to vanquish the dark lord approaches,born to those who have thrice defied him,born as the seventh month dies,and the dark lord will mark him as his equal,but he will have power the dark lord knows not,and either must destroy all but a remnant of the other,for those two different spirits cannot exist in the same world.Those dreadful words, spoken in that terrible booming voice, didn’tseem to fit something like partial Transfiguration.“Perhaps not, then,” Dumbledore said after Minerva tried to explain.“I confess I had been hoping for something that would help in findingVoldemort’s horcrux, wherever he may have hidden it. But…” The oldwizard shrugged. “Prophecies are tricky things, Minerva, and it is bestto take no chances. The smallest thing may prove decisive if it remainsunexpected.”“And what do you suppose he meant about Severus?” said Minerva.“There I have no idea,” sighed Dumbledore. “Unless Harry is making amove against Severus, and thought that an open question might be takenseriously where a direct allegation would be dismissed. And if that wasindeed what happened, Harry correctly reasoned that I would not trustthat it was so. Let us simply keep watch, without prejudice, as he asks.”Aftermath, 1:“Um, Hermione?” Harry said in a very small voice. “I think I owe youa really, really, really big apology.”Aftermath, 2:Alissa Cornfoot’s eyes were slightly glazed as she gazed upon thePotions Master giving her class a stern lecture, holding up a tiny bronzebean and saying something about screaming puddles of human flesh.Ever since the start of this year she’d been having trouble listening inPotions. She kept staring at their awful, mean, greasy professor andfantasizing about special detentions. There was probably somethingreally wrong with her but she just couldn’t seem to stop doing it—“Ow!” Alissa said then.Snape had just flicked the bronze bean unerringly at Alissa’s forehead.“Miss Cornfoot,” said the Potions Master, his voice cutting, “this is adelicate potion and if you cannot pay attention you will hurt your classmates, not just yourself. See me after class.”The last four words didn’t help her any, but she tried harder, and managed to get through the day without melting anyone.After class, Alissa approached the desk. Part of her wanted to standthere meekly with her face abashed and her hands clasped penitently behind her back, just in case, but some quiet instinct told her this mightbe a bad idea. So instead she just stood there with her face neutral, in aposture that was very proper for a young lady, and said, “Professor?”“Miss Cornfoot,” Snape said without looking up from the sheets hewas grading, “I do not return your affections, I begin to find your staresdisturbing, and you will restrain your eyes henceforth. Is that quiteclear?”“Yes,” said Alissa in a strangled squeak, and Snape dismissed her, andshe fled the classroom with her cheeks flaming like molten lava.492 *been a sinking feeling in Hermione’s stomach lately, everyThere’dtime she heard the other students talking about her and Harry.She’d been in a shower stall this morning when she’d overheard a conversation between Morag and Padma that had been the last straw piledon top of quite a lot of other straws.She was starting to think that getting involved in a rivalry with HarryPotter had been a terrible mistake.If she’d just stayed away from Harry Potter, she could have been Hermione Granger, the brightest academic star of Hogwarts, who was earning more points for Ravenclaw than anyone. She wouldn’t have been asfamous as the Boy-Who-Lived, but she would have been famous for herself.Instead the Boy-Who-Lived had an academic rival, and her name happened to be Hermione Granger.And worse, she had gone on a date with him.The idea of getting into a Romance with Harry had seemed like anappealing idea at first. She’d read books like that, and if there was anyonein Hogwarts who was a candidate for the heroine’s love interest it wasobviously Harry Potter. Bright, funny, famous, sometimes scary…So she’d forced Harry into going on a date with her.And now she was his love interest.Or worse, one of the options on his dinner menu.She’d been in a shower stall that morning and just about to turn on thewater, when she’d heard giggles coming from outside. And she’d heardMorag talking about how that Muggleborn girl probably wouldn’t fight493 *hard enough to win against Ginevra Weasley, and Padma speculatingthat Harry Potter might decide he wanted both.It was like they didn’t understand that GIRLS had options on theirdinner menu and BOYS fought over them.But that wasn’t even the part that hurt, really. It was that when shescored 98 on one of Professor McGonagall’s tests, the news wasn’t thatHermione Granger had scored the highest in the class, the news was thatHarry Potter’s rival had scored seven more points than him.If you got too close to the Boy-Who-Lived, you became part of hisstory.You didn’t get your own.And the thought had come to Hermione that she should just walkaway, but that would’ve been too sad.But she did want to get back what she’d accidentally given away by letting herself become known as Harry’s rival. She wanted to be a separateperson again instead of Harry Potter’s third leg, was that too much to ask?It was a hard trap to climb out of once you fell in. No matter howhigh you scored in class, even if you did something that deserved a specialdinnertime announcement, it just meant you were rivaling Harry Potteragain.But she thought she’d come up with a way.Something to do that wouldn’t be seen as pushing up on the oppositeend of Harry Potter’s seesaw.It would be hard.It would go against her nature.She would have to fight someone very evil.And she would need to ask someone even more evil for help.Hermione raised her hand to knock upon that terrible door.She hesitated.Hermione realized she was being silly, and raised her hand a bithigher.She tried to knock again.Her hand quite failed to touch the door.And then the door swung open anyway.494 *“Dear me,” said the spider, sitting in its web. “Was it really that hardto lose a single Quirrell point, Miss Granger?”Hermione stood there with her hand raised, her cheeks growing pink.It had been.“Well, Miss Granger, I shall be merciful,” said the evil Professor Quirrell. “Consider it already lost. There, I have taken a hard choice from you.Are you not grateful?”“Professor Quirrell,” Hermione managed to say in a voice thatsqueaked a little. “I have a lot of Quirrell points, don’t I?”“You do indeed,” said Professor Quirrell. “Though one less than youhad before. Terrible, isn’t it? Just think, if I don’t like your reason forcoming here, you could lose another fifty. Maybe I’d take them away one…by one… by one…”Hermione’s cheeks were going even redder. “You’re really evil, didanyone ever tell you that?”“Miss Granger,” Professor Quirrell said gravely, “it can be dangerous to give people compliments like that when they have not been trulyearned. The recipient might feel bashful and undeserving and want todo something worthy of your praise. Now what was it you wanted to talkto me about, Miss Granger?”It was after lunch on Thursday afternoon, and Hermione and Harry wereensconced in a little library nook, with a Quietus field up so they could talk.Harry was lying stomach-down on the ground with his elbows resting onthe floor and his head in his hands and his feet kicking up casually behindhim. Hermione was occupying a stuffed chair much too large for her, likeshe was the Hermione center of a candy shell.Harry had suggested that they could, as a first pass, read just the titlesof all the books in the library, and then Hermione could read all the tablesof contents.Hermione had thought this was a brilliant idea. She’d never done thatwith a library before.Unfortunately there was a slight flaw in this plan.495 *Namely, they were both Ravenclaws.Hermione was reading a book called Magical Mnemonics.Harry was reading a book called The Skeptical Wizard.Each had thought it was just one special exception they would makeonly this one time, and neither had yet realized it was impossible for either of them to ever finish reading all the book titles no matter how hardthey tried.The quiet of their little nook was broken by two words.“Oh, no,” Harry suddenly said out loud, sounding like the words hadbeen torn out of him.There was a bit more quiet.“He didn’t,” Harry said, in the same voice.Then she heard Harry start giggling helplessly.Hermione looked up from her book.“All right,” she said, “what is it?”“I just found out why you never ask the Weasleys about the family rat,”Harry said. “It’s really awful and I shouldn’t be laughing and I’m a terribleperson.”“Yes,” Hermione said primly, “you are. Tell me too.”“Okay, first the background. There’s a whole chapter in this bookabout Sirius Black conspiracy theories. You remember who that is,right?”“Of course,” said Hermione. Sirius Black was a traitor, a friend ofJames Potter who had let Voldemort into the protected home of the Potters.“So it turns out there were a number of, shall we say, irregularities, associated with Black going to Azkaban. He didn’t get a trial, and the JuniorMinister in charge when the Aurors arrested Black was none other thanCornelius Fudge, who became our current Minister of Magic.”That sounded a little suspicious to Hermione too, and she said asmuch.Harry made a shrugging motion with his shoulders, as he lay on thefloor looking at his book. “Suspicious things happen all the time, and ifyou’re a conspiracy theorist you can always find something.”“But no trial?” said Hermione.496 *“It was right after the Dark Lord’s defeat,” Harry said, his voice serious as he said it. “Things were incredibly chaotic, and when the Aurorstracked down Black he was standing there laughing in a street ankle-deepin blood, with twenty eyewitnesses to recount how he’d killed a friend ofmy father’s named Peter Pettigrew plus twelve bystanders. I’m not sayingI approve of Black not getting a trial. But these are wizards we’re talkingabout here, so it’s not really any more suspicious than, I don’t know, thesort of thing people point to when they want to argue over who shot JohnF. Kennedy. So anyway, Sirius Black is the wizarding Lee Harvey Oswald.There’s all sorts of conspiracy theories about who really betrayed my parents instead of him, and one of the favorites is Peter Pettigrew, and thisis where it starts getting complicated.”Hermione listened, fascinated. “But how do you go from there to theWeasleys’ pet rat—”“Hold on,” said Harry, “I’m getting there. Now, after Pettigrew’sdeath it came out that he’d been a spy for the Light—not a double agent,just someone who snuck around and found things out. He’d been goodat that since he was a teenager, even in Hogwarts he had a reputation forfinding out all sorts of secrets. So the conspiracy theory is that Pettigrewbecame an unregistered Animagus while he was still in Hogwarts, anAnimagus of something small that could scurry around and listen toconversations. The main problem being that successful Animagi arerare and doing it as a teenager would be really unlikely, so of coursethe conspiracy theory says that my father and Black were unregisteredAnimagi too. And in that conspiracy theory, Pettigrew himself killed thetwelve bystanders, turned into his small Animagus form, and ran. SoMichael Shermer says there are four additional problems with this. One,Black was the only one besides my parents who knew how to get throughthe wards around their house.” (Harry’s voice was a little hard as he saidthat.) “Two, Black was a more likely suspect to start with than Pettigrew,there’s a rumor Black deliberately tried to get a student killed during histime at Hogwarts, and he was from this really nasty pureblood family,Bellatrix Black was literally his cousin. Three, Black was twenty times thefighting wizard that Pettigrew was, even if he wasn’t as smart. The duelbetween them would have been like Professor Quirrell versus Professor497 *Sprout. Pettigrew probably didn’t even get a chance to draw his wand,let alone fake all the evidence the conspiracy theory requires. And four,Black was standing in the street laughing.”“But the rat—” said Hermione.“Right,” Harry said. “Well, to make a long story short, Bill Weasleydecided that his little brother Percy’s pet rat was Pettigrew’s Animagusform—”Hermione’s jaw dropped.“Yes,” Harry said, “you wouldn’t exactly expect Evil Pettigrew to beliving a sad and furtive life as the pet rat of an enemy wizarding family,he’d either be with the Malfoys or, more likely, off in the Carribean aftera bit of plastic surgery. Anyway, Bill knocks out his little brother Percy,stuns and grabs the rat, sends out all these emergency owl messages—”“Oh, no!” Hermione said, the words torn out of her.“—and somehow manages to gather Dumbledore, the Minister ofMagic, and the Head Auror—”“He didn’t!” said Hermione.“And of course when they get there they think he’s crazy, but they useVeritas Oculum on the rat anyway, just to be sure, and what do they discover?”She would’ve died. “A rat.”“You win a cookie! So they dragged poor Bill Weasley off to St.Mungo’s and it turned out to be a pretty standard schizophrenic break,it just happens to some people, especially young men around what we’dconsider college age. Guy was convinced he was ninety-seven yearsold and had died and gone back in time to his younger self via trainstation. And he responded perfectly well to antipsychotics and is backto normal and everything’s fine now, except people don’t talk as muchanymore about Sirius Black conspiracy theories, and you don’t ever askthe Weasleys about the family rat.”Hermione was giggling helplessly. It was really awful and sheshouldn’t be laughing and she was a terrible person.“The thing I don’t understand,” Harry said, after their giggles had dieddown, “is why Black would hunt down Pettigrew instead of running asfast as he could. He had to know the Aurors would be after him. I wonder498 *if they got the reason out of Black before they took him to Azkaban? See,this is why people who are absolutely positively guilty still go through thelegal system and get trials.”Hermione had to agree with that.Soon Harry was done with his book while Hermione was only halfwaythrough hers—hers was a much more difficult book than Harry’s, but shestill felt embarrassed about that. And then she had to put Magical Mnemonics back on the shelf and drag herself away, because it was time for her toface the most dreaded class in Hogwarts, BROOMSTICK RIDING.Harry tagged along as she walked there, even though his own classwasn’t until an hour and a half later, like a fighter jet escorting a sad littlepropeller plane on its way to its own funeral.The boy wished her goodbye in a quiet, sympathetic voice, and shewalked onto the grassy fields of Doom.And there was much shrieking and almost falling and horrible brushes with death and the ground in completely the wrong place and the sungetting in her eyes and Morag buzzing her and Mandy thinking she wasbeing subtle about always being near enough to catch her if she fell andshe knew the other students were laughing at both of them but she neversaid anything to Mandy because she didn’t actually want to die.After ten million years the class ended, and she was back on theground where she belonged until next Thursday. Sometimes she hadnightmares about it always being Thursday.Why everyone had to learn this, when they were just going to Apparateor Floo or portkey everywhere once they grew up, was a complete andutter mystery to Hermione. Nobody actually needed to ride broomsticksas an adult, it was like being forced to play dodgeball in P.E.At least Harry had the decency to be ashamed of being good at it.It was a couple of hours later, and she was in a Hufflepuff study hall withHannah, Susan, Leanne, and Megan. Professor Flitwick, surprisingly diffident for a teacher, had asked if she might possibly maybe help those499 *four with their Charms homework for a while, even though they weren’tRavenclaws, and Hermione had felt so proud she’d almost burst.Hermione took a piece of parchment, spilled a little bit of ink on it,tore it into four pieces, crumpled them, and tossed the pieces on the table.She could have gotten it just from crumpling it, but doing all thatmade it more like garbage, and that helped when someone was firstpracticing the Disposal Charm.Hermione sharpened her ears and eyes, and said, “Okay, try it.”“Everto.”“Everto.”“Everto.”“Everto.”Hermione didn’t think she’d quite caught all the problems. “Can youall try it again?”An hour later Hermione had concluded that (1), Leanne and Meganwere sort of sloppy, but if you asked them to keep practicing something,they would, (2) Hannah and Susan were focused and driven to the pointwhere you had to keep telling them to slow down and relax and think aboutthings instead of trying so hard—it was odd to think that those two wouldsoon be hers—and (3) she liked helping Hufflepuffs, the whole study hallhad a very cheerful atmosphere.When she left for dinner, she found the Boy-Who-Lived reading abook while he waited to escort her. It made her feel flattered, and alsoa little worried because Harry didn’t seem to really talk to anyone besidesher.“Did you know there’s a girl in Hufflepuff who’s a Metamorphmagus?”said Hermione as they headed toward the Great Hall. “She makes her hairreally red, like stopsign red not Weasley red, and when she spilled hot teaon herself she turned into a black-haired boy until she got it under controlagain.”“Really? Cool,” said Harry, sounding a bit distracted. “Um, Hermione,just to check, you know tomorrow is the last day to sign up for ProfessorQuirrell’s armies, right?”“Yes,” Hermione said. “The armies of the evil Professor Quirrell.” Hervoice was a little angry, though Harry didn’t know why, of course.“Hermione,” Harry said, his voice exasperated, “he’s not evil. He’s alittle bit Dark and a whole lot Slytherin. It’s not the same as being evil.”Harry Potter had too many words for things, that was his problem.He would have been better off if he’d just divided the universe into Goodand Bad. “Professor Quirrell called me up in front of the whole class andtold me to shoot someone!”“He was right,” Harry said, his face sober. “I’m sorry, Hermione, buthe was. You should have shot me, I wouldn’t have minded. You can’t learnBattle Magic if you can’t practice against real opponents using real spells.And now you’re doing okay in sparring, aren’t you?”Hermione was only twelve, and so she knew, but she couldn’t put itinto words, she couldn’t find the thing to say that would convince Harry.Professor Quirrell had taken a young girl and called up that girl infront of everyone, and ordered her to open fire without provocation on aclassmate.It didn’t matter if Professor Quirrell was right about her needing tolearn it.Professor McGonagall wouldn’t ever have done that.Professor Flitwick wouldn’t ever have done that.Maybe not even Professor Snape would have done that.Professor Quirrell was EVIL.But she couldn’t find the words, and she knew that Harry would neverbelieve her.“Hermione, I’ve talked to older students,” Harry said. “Professor Quirrell could be the only competent Defense Professor we get in all sevenyears at Hogwarts. Anything else we can learn later. If we want to studyDefense, we have to do it this year. The students who sign up for the extracurricular stuff are going to be learning huge amounts, way beyondwhat the Ministry thinks first-years are supposed to study—did you knowwe’re going to be learning the Patronus Charm? In January?”“The Patronus Charm?” Hermione said, her voice going up in surprise.Her books said that was one of the brightest magics known, a weaponagainst the Darkest creatures, cast with pure positive emotions. It wasn’tsomething she’d expect the evil Professor Quirrell to teach—or arrange tobe taught, since Hermione couldn’t imagine he could do the spell himself.“Yes,” Harry said. “Students don’t usually learn the Patronus Charmuntil their fifth years or even later! But Professor Quirrell says the Ministry schedules were made up by talking Flobberworms, and the abilityto cast the Patronus Charm depends on emotions more than magicalstrength. Professor Quirrell says that he thinks most students do wayless than they can, and this year he’s going to prove it.”There was the usual tone of awed worship that Harry’s voice had whenhe talked about Professor Quirrell, and Hermione gritted her teeth andkept walking.“I already signed up, actually,” Hermione said, her voice a little quiet.“I did it this morning. For everything, just like you said.”In for a penny, in for a pound was the usual expression.Besides, she didn’t want to lose, and if she wanted to win she had tolearn.“So you will be in the armies, then?” Harry’s voice was suddenly enthusiastic. “That’s awesome, Hermione! I’ve already gotten my list of soldiers, but I’m sure Professor Quirrell will let me add one more, or trade—”“I’m not joining your army.” Hermione’s voice was sharp. She knew itwas a reasonable assumption but it still annoyed her.Harry blinked. “Not Draco Malfoy’s, surely. So you want to be in thethird army? Even though we don’t know who the general is yet?” Harrysounded surprised and a little wounded, and she couldn’t blame him,though of course she did blame him, since in fact it was all his fault. “Butwhy not mine?”“Think about it,” Hermione snapped, “and maybe you’ll work it out!”And she sped up her stride and left Harry gaping behind her.“Professor Quirrell,” Draco said in his most formal voice, “I must protestyour appointment of Hermione Granger as the third general.”“Oh?” said Professor Quirrell, leaning back in his chair in a casual andrelaxed manner. “Protest away, Mr. Malfoy.”“Granger is unfit for the position,” said Draco.502 *Professor Quirrell tapped a finger on his cheek thoughtfully. “Whyyes, yes she is. Do you have any further protests?”“Professor Quirrell,” said Harry Potter beside him, “with all due respect to Miss Granger’s many outstanding academic talents and the Quirrell points she has justly earned in your classes, her personality is notsuited to military command.”Draco had been relieved when Harry had agreed to accompany himto Professor Quirrell’s office. It wasn’t just that Harry was a gigantic blatant teacher’s pet where Professor Quirrell was concerned. Draco hadalso started to worry that Harry actually was friends with Granger, it hadbeen a while now and he still hadn’t made his move… but this was morelike it.“I agree with Mr. Potter,” said Draco. “Appointing her as a generalturns it into a farce.”“Harshly put,” said Harry, “but I cannot bring myself to disagreewith Mr. Malfoy. To be blunt, Professor Quirrell, Hermione Granger hasaround as much intent to kill as a bowl of wet grapes.”“That,” said Professor Quirrell mildly, “is not a thing I would fail tonotice myself. You are telling me nothing I do not already know.”It was Draco’s turn to say something, but the conversation had suddenly hiccupped. That answer had not been in the possibilities he andHarry had brainstormed before coming here. What did you say after theteacher said that he knew everything you knew and he was still going tocommit an obvious mistake?The silence stretched.“Is this some sort of plot?” Harry said slowly.“Must everything I do be some sort of plot?” said Professor Quirrell.“Can’t I ever create chaos just for the sake of chaos?”Draco almost choked.“Not in your Battle Magic class,” Harry said with calm certainty.“Other places, maybe, but not there.”Professor Quirrell slowly raised his eyebrows.Harry gazed steadily back at him.Draco shivered.503 *“Well then,” Professor Quirrell said. “Neither of you seem to have considered a very simple question. Who could I appoint instead of Miss Granger?”“Blaise Zabini,” Draco said without hesitation.“Any other suggestions?” said Professor Quirrell, sounding quiteamused.Anthony Goldstein and Ernie Macmillan, came the thought, beforeDraco’s common sense kicked in and ruled out mudbloods and Hufflepuffs no matter how aggressively they dueled. So instead Draco justsaid, “What’s wrong with Zabini?”“I see…” Harry said slowly.“I don’t,” said Draco. “Why not Zabini?”Professor Quirrell looked at Draco. “Because, Mr. Malfoy, no matterhow hard he tries, he’ll never be able to keep up with you or Mr. Potter.”The shock of it staggered Draco. “You can’t believe Granger is goingto—”“He’s gambling on her,” Harry said quietly. “It’s not guaranteed. Theodds aren’t even good. She’ll probably never give us a good fight, and evenif she does, it may take her months to learn. But she’s the only one in ouryear with any chance at all of growing to beat us.”Draco’s hands twitched but didn’t clench into fists. Showing up asyour supporter and then backing out was a classic undermining tactic,so Harry Potter was in it with Granger and that implied—“But Professor,” Harry went on smoothly, “I’m worried Hermione willbe miserable as the general of an army. I’m speaking as her friend now,Professor Quirrell. The competition might be good for Draco and me, butwhat you’re asking her to do isn’t good for her!”Never mind.“Your friendship for Hermione Granger does you credit,” ProfessorQuirrell said dryly. “Especially as you are able to be friends with DracoMalfoy at the same time. Quite a feat, that.”Harry suddenly looked a little nervous, meaning he probably felt a lotmore nervous, and Draco silently swore to himself. Of course Harry wasn’tgoing to fool Professor Quirrell.504 *“And I doubt Miss Granger would appreciate your friendly concern,”said Professor Quirrell. “She asked me for the position, Mr. Potter, I didnot ask her.”Harry was quiet at this for a moment. Then he flashed Draco a quicklook that mixed apology and warning, saying at the same time, Sorry, Idid my best and We’d better not press it any further.“As for her being miserable,” Professor Quirrell went on, a slight smilenow playing about his lips, “I suspect that she will have a much easier timewith the rigors of her position than either of you suspect, and that she willput up a good fight much sooner than you think.”Harry and Draco both gasped in horror.“You’re not going to advise her, are you?” said Draco, utterly aghast.“I never signed up to fight you!” said Harry.The smile playing around Professor Quirrell’s lips grew wider. “As amatter of fact, I did offer to share a few suggestions regarding Miss Granger’s first battles.”“Professor Quirrell!” said Harry.“Oh, don’t worry,” Professor Quirrell said. “She turned me down. Justas I expected.”Draco’s eyes narrowed.“Dear me, Mr. Potter,” said Professor Quirrell, “didn’t anyone ever tellyou it’s rude to stare?”“You’re not going to secretly help her some other way, are you?” saidHarry.“Would I do that?” said Professor Quirrell.“Yes,” said Draco and Harry at the same time.“I am wounded by your lack of trust. Well then, I promise not to helpGeneral Granger in any way that the two of you don’t know about. Andnow I suggest that both of you be about your military affairs. Novemberapproaches, and swiftly.”Draco saw the implications before the door had closed all the way behindthem on their way out of Professor Quirrell’s office.505 *Harry had once spoken dismissively of “people stuff”.And now that was Draco’s only hope.Let him not realize, let him not realize…“We should just attack the Granger girl first and get her out of ourway,” said Draco. “After we crush her, we can have our own contest without any distractions.”“Now that doesn’t really seem fair to her, does it?” said Harry in a mildvoice.“What do you care?” said Draco. “She’s your rival, right?” Then, withjust the right note of suspicion in his voice, “Don’t tell me you’ve startedreally liking her, after being her rival all this time…”“Founders forbid,” said Harry. “What can I say, Draco? I merely havea natural sense of justice. Granger does too, you know. She has a veryfirm grasp on good and evil, and she’s probably going to attack evil first.Having a name like ‘Malfoy’ is just asking for it, you know.”“Harry,” said Draco, sounding wounded and maybe a little superior,“don’t you want to fight fairly against me?”“You mean rather than attacking you after you’ve already lost someof your forces beating Granger?” said Harry. “Oh, I don’t know. Maybeafter I get bored with just winning I’ll try that ‘fair’ thing.”“Maybe she’ll attack you,” Draco said. “You’re her rival.”“But I’m her friendly rival,” Harry said with an evil grin. “I bought hera nice birthday present and everything. You wouldn’t go around sabotaging your friendly rival like that.”“What about sabotaging your friend’s chance at a fair fight?” saidDraco angrily. “I thought we were friends!”“Let me rephrase that,” said Harry. “Granger wouldn’t sabotage afriendly rival. But that’s because she has the killing intention of a bowl ofwet grapes. You would. You totally would. And guess what, so would I.”If it had been a play, there would have been dramatic music.506 *The hero, impeccably turned out in green-trimmed robes and perfectly combed white-blonde hair, faced the villain.The villain, leaning back in a simple wooden chair with her buckteethclearly visible and stray chestnut curls drifting over her cheeks, faced thehero.It was Wednesday, October 30th, and the first battle was coming upon Sunday.Draco was standing in General Granger’s office, a room the size ofa small classroom. (Why each general’s office was so large, Draco wasn’tquite sure. A chair and a desk would have worked for him. He wasn’t evenclear on why the generals needed offices at all, his soldiers knew where tofind him. Unless Professor Quirrell had deliberately arranged the hugeoffices for them as a sign of status, in which case Draco was all for it.)Granger sat on the room’s single chair like a throne, all the way onthe other end of the office from where the door opened. There was a longoblong table stretched across the middle of the room between them, andfour small circular tables scattered around the corners, but only that onesingle chair, all the way at the opposite end. The room had windows alongone wall, and one beam of sunlight touched the top of Granger’s hair likea glowing crown.It would have been nice if Draco could have walked slowly forward.But there was a table in the way, and Draco had to go around it diagonally,and there was no good way to do that in a dramatic and dignified fashion.Had that been deliberate? If it had been his father, it surely would havebeen; but this was Granger, so surely not.There was nowhere for him to sit, and Granger hadn’t stood up, either.Draco kept the outrage entirely off his face.“Well, Mr. Draco Malfoy,” Granger said once he stood before her, “yourequested an audience with me and I have been so gracious as to grant it.What was your plea?”Come with me to visit Malfoy Manor, my father and I would like to show yousome interesting spells.“Your rival, Potter, came to me with an offer,” said Draco, putting aserious look on his face. “He doesn’t mind losing to me, but would be507 *humiliated if you won. So he wants to join with me and wipe you outimmediately, not just in our first battle, all of them. If I won’t do that,Potter wants me to hold back or harass you, while he launches an all-outattack on you as his first move.”“I see,” Granger said, looking surprised. “And you’re offering to helpme against him?”“Of course,” said Draco smoothly. “I didn’t think what he wanted todo to you was fair.”“Why, that’s very nice of you, Mr. Malfoy,” said Granger. “I’m sorry forhow I spoke to you earlier. We should be friends. Can I call you Drakey?”Alarm bells started to sound in Draco’s head, but there was a chanceshe meant it…“Of course,” said Draco, “if I can call you Hermy.”Draco was pretty sure he saw her expression flicker.“Anyway,” Draco said, “I was thinking it would serve Potter right if weboth attacked him and wiped him out.”“But that wouldn’t be fair to Mr. Potter, would it?” said Granger.“I think it’d be very fair,” Draco said. “He was planning to do it to youfirst.”Granger was giving him a stern look that could possibly have intimidated him if he’d been a Hufflepuff instead of a Malfoy. “You think I’mpretty stupid, don’t you, Mr. Malfoy?”Draco smiled charmingly. “No, Miss Granger, but I thought I’d atleast check. So, what do you want?”“Are you offering to bribe me?” said Granger.“Sure,” said Draco. “Can I just slip you a Galleon and have you beat onPotter instead of me for the rest of the year?”“Nope,” said Granger, “but you can offer me ten Galleons and have meattack both of you equally, instead of just you.”“Ten Galleons is a lot of money,” Draco said cautiously.“I didn’t know the Malfoys were poor,” said Granger.Draco stared at Granger.He was starting to get a strange feeling about this.That particular reply didn’t seem like it should have come from thisparticular girl.508 *“Well,” said Draco, “you don’t get to be rich by wasting money, youknow.”“I don’t know if you know what a dentist is, Mr. Malfoy, but my parents are dentists and anything less than ten Galleons isn’t worth my timeat all.”“Three Galleons,” Draco said, more as a probe than anything else.“Nope,” said Granger. “If you want an equal fight at all, I don’t believethat a Malfoy wants an equal fight less than he wants ten Galleons.”Draco was starting to get a very strange feeling about this.“No,” said Draco.“No?” said Granger. “This is a limited time offer, Mr. Malfoy. Are yousure you want to risk a whole year of being miserably crushed by the BoyWho-Lived? That would be pretty embarrassing for the House of Malfoy,wouldn’t it?”It was a very persuasive argument, one that was hard to refuse, butyou didn’t get to be rich by spending money when your heart told you itwas a setup.“No,” said Draco.“See you on Sunday,” said Granger.Draco turned and walked out of the office without another word.That had been not right…“Hermione,” Harry said patiently, “we’re supposed to be plotting againsteach other. You could even betray me and it wouldn’t mean anything outside the battlefield.”Hermione shook her head. “It wouldn’t be nice, Harry.”Harry sighed. “I don’t think you’re getting into the spirit of this at all.”It wouldn’t be nice. She’d actually said that. Hermione didn’t knowwhether to be insulted at what Harry thought of her, or worried aboutwhether she really did sound like that much of a goody-two-shoes usually.It was probably time to change the subject.“Anyway, are you doing anything special for tomorrow?” said Hermione. “It’s—”509 *Her voice cut off abruptly as she realized.“Yes, Hermione,” Harry said a little tightly, “what day is it?”Interlude:There was a time when October 31st had been called Halloween inmagical Britain.Now it was Harry Potter Day.Harry had turned down all the offers, even the one from MinisterFudge which might have been good for future political favors and whichhe really should have gritted his teeth and taken. But to Harry, October31st would always be The Dark Lord Killed My Parents Day. There shouldhave been a quiet, dignified memorial service somewhere, and if therewas one, he hadn’t been invited.Hogwarts got the day off to celebrate. Even the Slytherins didn’t darewear black outside their own dorm. There were special events and specialfoods and the teachers looked the other way if anyone ran through thehallways. It was the tenth anniversary, after all.Harry spent the day in his trunk so as not to spoil it for anyone else,eating snack bars in place of meals, reading some of his sadder sciencefiction books (no fantasy), and writing a letter to Mum and Dad that wasmuch longer than the ones he usually sent.he day was Sunday, November 3rd, and soon the three great powers of their school year, Harry Potter, Draco Malfoy, and HermioneGranger, would begin their struggle for supreme dominance.(Harry was slightly annoyed by the way the Boy-Who-Lived had beendemoted from supreme dominance to one of three equal rivals just byentering the contest, but he expected to get it back soon.)The battleground was a section of non-Forbidden forest, dense withtrees, because Professor Quirrell thought that being able to see all the enemy forces was too boring even for your very first battle.All the students who were not actually in a first-year army werecamped out nearby and watching on screens that Professor Quirrellhad set up. Except for three Gryffindors in their fourth year, who werecurrently sick and confined to healer’s beds by Madam Pomfrey. Asidefrom that, everyone was there.The students were dressed, not in their ordinary school robes, but inMuggle camouflage uniforms that Professor Quirrell had obtained somewhere and supplied in sufficient quantity and variety to fit everyone. Itwasn’t that students would have worried about stains and rips, that waswhat Charms were for. But as Professor Quirrell had explained to the surprised wizardborns, nice dignified clothing was not efficient for hidingin forests or dodging around trees.And on each uniform’s breast, a patch bearing the name and insigniaof your army. A small patch. If you wanted your soldiers to wear, say,colored ribbons so that they could identify each other at a distance, andrisk the enemy getting their hands on the ribbons, that was all up to you.Harry had tried to get the name Dragon Army.Draco had pitched a fit and said that would confuse everyone completely.Professor Quirrell had ruled that Draco could lay prior claim to thename, if he wished.So now Harry was fighting Dragon Army.This probably wasn’t a good sign.For their insignia, instead of the too-obvious dragon’s head breathingfire, Draco had elected to simply go with the fire. Elegant, understated,deadly: This is what’s left after we’ve passed. Very Malfoy.Harry, after considering alternate choices such as the 501st Provisional Battalion and Harry’s Minions o’ Doom, had decided that his armywould be known by the simple and dignified appellation of the ChaosLegion.Their insignia was a hand poised with fingers ready to snap.It was universally agreed that this wasn’t a good sign.Harry had earnestly advised Hermione that the young boys servingunder her were probably nervous about her being a girl with a reputationfor being nice, and that she should pick something scary that would reassure them of her toughness and make them proud to be part of her army,like the Blood Commandos or something.Hermione had named her army the Sunshine Regiment.Their insignia was a smiley face.And in ten minutes, they would be at war.Harry stood in the bright forest clearing that was their assigned starting location, an area of open space with old and rotting tree stumps thathad been cleared away for some unknown purpose, ground coated with asmall scattering of blown leaves and the dried grey remnants of grass thathad failed the test of summer’s heat, and the sun shining down brilliantlyfrom above.Around him were the twenty-three soldiers that Professor Quirrellhad assigned to him. Nearly all of Gryffindor had signed up, of course,and more than half of Slytherin, and less than half of Hufflepuff, and ahandful of Ravenclaw. In Harry’s army there were twelve Gryffindors andsix Slytherins and four Hufflepuffs and one Ravenclaw besides himself…not that there was any way to tell that by looking at the uniforms. Nored, no green, no yellow, no blue. Just Muggle camouflage patterns, anda patch on the breast with the device of a hand poised to snap its fingers.Harry looked upon his twenty-three soldiers, all wearing the sameuniforms with no marks of group identity save that single patch.And lo, Harry smiled, because he understood what this part of Professor Quirrell’s master plan was about; and Harry was taking full advantageof it for his own purposes, too.There was a legendary episode in social psychology called the Robbers Cave experiment. It had been set up in the bewildered aftermath ofWorld War II, with the intent of investigating the causes and remediesof conflicts between groups. The scientists had set up a summer campfor 22 boys from 22 different schools, selecting them to all be from stable middle-class families. The first phase of the experiment had been intended to investigate what it took to start a conflict between groups. The22 boys had been divided into two groups of 11——and this had been quite sufficient.The hostility had started from the moment the two groups had become aware of each others’ existences in the state park, insults beinghurled on the first meeting. They’d named themselves the Eagles and theRattlers (they hadn’t needed names for themselves when they thoughtthey were the only ones in the park) and had proceeded to develop contrasting group stereotypes, the Rattlers thinking of themselves as roughand-tough and swearing heavily, the Eagles correspondingly deciding tothink of themselves as upright-and-proper.The other part of the experiment had been testing how to resolvegroup conflicts. Bringing the boys together to watch fireworks hadn’tworked at all. They’d just shouted at each other and stayed apart. Whathad worked was warning them that there might be vandals in the park,and the two groups needing to work together to solve a failure of thepark’s water system. A common task, a common enemy.Harry had a strong suspicion Professor Quirrell had understood thisprinciple very well indeed when he had chosen to create three armies peryear.Three armies.Not four.And definitely not segregated by House… except that no Slytherinshad been assigned to Draco besides Mr. Crabbe and Mr. Goyle.It was things like this which reassured Harry that Professor Quirrell,despite his affected Dark atmosphere and his pretense of neutrality inthe conflict between Good and Evil, was secretly backing Good, not thatHarry would ever dare say that out loud.And Harry had decided to take full advantage of Professor Quirrell’splan to define a group identity his way.The Rattlers, once they’d met the Eagles, had started thinking ofthemselves as rough-and-tough, and they’d conducted themselves accordingly.The Eagles had thought of themselves as good-and-proper.And in that bright forest clearing, scattered around the old and rotting tree stumps, outlined in the sun shining down brilliantly from above,General Potter and his twenty-three soldiers were arranged in nothing remotely resembling a formation. Some soldiers stood, some soldiers sat,some stood on one leg just to be different.It was the Chaos Legion, after all.And if there wasn’t a reason to stand in neat little lines, Harry had saiddisdainfully, there weren’t going to be neat little lines.Harry had divided the army into 6 squads of 4 soldiers each, eachsquad commanded by a Squad Suggester. All troops were under strict orders to disobey any orders they were given if it seemed like a good idea atthe time, including that one… unless Harry or the Squad Suggester prefixed the order with “Merlin says”, in which case you were supposed toactually obey.The Chaos Legion’s chief attack was to split up and run in from multiple directions, randomly changing vectors and firing the approved sleepspell as rapidly as you could rebuild the magical strength. And if you sawa chance to distract or confuse the enemy, you took it.Fast. Creative. Unpredictable. Non-homogenous. Don’t just obeyorders, think about whether what you’re doing right now makes sense.Harry wasn’t quite as sure as he’d pretended that this was the optimum of military efficiency… but he’d been given a golden opportunity tochange how some students thought about themselves, and that was how heintended to use it.Five minutes to wartime, according to Harry’s watch.General Potter walked (not marched) over to where his air force waswaiting tensely, broomsticks already clutched firmly in their hands.“All wings report in,” said General Potter. They’d rehearsed this during their one training session on Saturday.“Red Leader standing by,” said Seamus Finnigan, who had no ideawhat it meant.“Red Five standing by,” said Dean Thomas, who’d waited his entirelife to say it.“Green Leader standing by,” Theodore Nott said rather stiffly.“Green Forty-One standing by,” Tracey Davis said.“I want you in the air the instant we hear the bell,” said General Potter.“Do not engage, repeat, do not engage. Evade if under fire.” (Of courseyou did not aim sleep spells at broomsticks; you fired a spell that gave atemporary red glow to whatever it hit. If you hit the broomstick or therider, they were out of the war.) “Red Leader and Red Five, fly towardMalfoy’s army as fast as you can, stay as high as you can while still seeingthem, return the instant you know for sure what they’re doing. GreenLeader, do the same for Granger’s army. Green Forty-One, fly above usand watch for any approaching broomsticks or soldiers, you and only youare authorized to fire. And remember, I didn’t say ‘Merlin says’ for any ofthat, but we do really need the information. For Chaos!”“For Chaos!” the four echoed with varying degrees of enthusiasm.Harry expected Hermione to launch an immediate attack on Draco,in which case he’d move his troops into position and start supportingher, but only after she’d taken severe losses and caused some damage.He would frame it as a heroic rescue, if possible; it wouldn’t do to haveSunshine thinking that Chaos wasn’t their friend, after all.But just in case she didn’t… well, that was why the Chaos Legion wasstaying put until Green Leader reported back.Draco’s moves would be in his own self-interest. He would predictably ready his army to defend against Hermione; he might or mightnot realize that Harry had been lying about waiting to attack until afterthat battle finished. Harry had still put two broomsticks on DragonArmy, just in case they were doing something, and just in case Draco orMr. Goyle or Mr. Crabbe was good enough to shoot a broomstick out ofthe sky.But General Granger was the unpredictable one, and Harry couldn’tmove until he knew how she was moving.In the heart of the forest, with shadow patterns dancing on the ground asleafy canopies swayed high above, General Malfoy stood where the treeswere relatively sparser, and looked out on his troops with calm satisfaction. Six units of three troops each, the Aerial Unit of four (to which Gregory was assigned), and the Command Unit, which was himself and Vincent. They’d only drilled for a short time on the previous Saturday, butDraco was confident that he’d managed to explain the basics. Stay withyour mates, watch their back and trust them to watch yours. Move as asingle body. Obey orders and show no fear. Aim, fire, move, aim again,fire again.The six units were formed up in a defensive perimeter around Draco,watchfully gazing outward into the forest. Back-to-back they stood,wands gripped low until they needed to strike.They already looked remarkably like the Auror units whose trainingDraco had watched during his father’s inspections.Chaos and Sunshine weren’t going to know what hit them.“Attention,” said General Malfoy.The six units unfolded and spun toward Draco; the faces of his broomstick riders turned from where they stood with broomsticks already inhand.Draco had decided to wait on demanding salutes until after they wontheir first battle, when Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs would be more willing to salute a Malfoy.But his soldiers were already standing straight enough, especially theGryffindors, that Draco wondered if he’d even needed to delay. Gregoryhad quietly listened, and reported back that Draco’s volunteering tostand by Harry Potter in Defense class, that time when Professor Quirrell had taught Harry how to lose, had marked Draco as an acceptablecommander. At least if you happened to be assigned to his army. Notall Slytherins are alike; there are Slytherins, and then there are Slytherins waswhat the Gryffindors in Draco’s army were quoting to their Housemates.Draco was frankly astounded at how incredibly easy that had been.Draco had protested at first about not being assigned any Slytherins,and Professor Quirrell had told him that if he wanted to be the first Malfoy to gain complete political control of the country, he needed to learnhow to govern the other three-quarters of the population. It was thingslike this which reassured Draco that Professor Quirrell had a great dealmore sympathy for the good guys than Professor Quirrell was letting on.The actual battle wouldn’t be easy, especially if Granger did attack theDragons first. Draco had agonized over whether to commit all his forcesagainst Granger immediately in a preemptive strike, but had worried that(1) Harry had been misleading him completely about what Granger waslikely to do, and (2) Harry had been misleading him about waiting untilafter Granger’s attack to join the battle.Though Dragon Army had a secret weapon, three of them in fact,which might be enough to win even if they were attacked by both armiesat once…It was almost time, and that meant it was time for the pre-battlespeech that Draco had composed and memorized.“The battle is about to begin,” Draco said. His voice was calm and precise. “Remember everything that I and Mr. Crabbe and Mr. Goyle showedyou. An army wins because it is disciplined and deadly. General Potterand the Chaos Legion will not be disciplined. Granger and the SunshineRegiment will not be deadly. We are disciplined, we are deadly, we areDragons. The battle is about to begin, and we are about to win it.”(Ex tempore speech given by General Potter to the Chaos Legion,immediately before their first battle, on November 3rd, 1991, at2:56pm:)My troops, I’m not going to lie to you, our situation today is very grim.Dragon Army has never lost a single battle. And Hermione Granger… hasa very good memory. The truth is, most of you are probably going to die.And the survivors will envy the dead. But we have to win this. We haveto win this so that someday, our children can enjoy the taste of chocolate again. Everything is at stake here. Literally everything. If we lose,the whole universe just blinks out like a light bulb. And now I realize thatmost of you don’t know what a light bulb is. Well, take it from me, it’s bad.But if we have to go down, let’s go down fighting, like heroes, so that asthe darkness closes in, we can think to ourselves, at least we had fun. Areyou afraid to die? I know I am. I can feel those cold shivers of fear likesomeone is pumping ice cream into my shirt. But I know… that historyis watching us. It was watching us when we changed into our uniforms.It was probably taking pictures. And history, my troops, is written by thevictors. If we win this, we can write our own history. A history in whichHogwarts was founded by four renegade house elves. We can make everyone study that history, even though it isn’t true, and if they don’t answerthe right way on our tests… they’ll fail the class. Isn’t that worth dying for?No, don’t answer that. Some things are better left unknown. None of usknow why we’re here. None of us know why we’re fighting. We just wokeup in these uniforms in this mysterious forest, knowing only that therewas no way to get our names and memories back except victory. The students in those other armies out there… they’re just like us. They don’twant to die. They’re fighting to protect each other, the only friends theyhave left. They’re fighting because they know they have families who’llmiss them, even if they can’t remember now. They may even be fightingto save the world. But we have a better reason to fight than they do. Wefight because we like it. We fight to amuse eldritch monstrosities frombeyond Space and Time. We fight because we’re Chaos. Soon the finalbattle will begin, so let me say now, because I won’t get a chance later,that it was an honor to be your commander, however briefly. Thank you,thank you all. And remember, your goal isn’t just to cut down the enemy,it’s to make them afraid.A great booming gong echoed over the forest.And the Sunshine Regiment began to march.The tension rose and rose, as Harry and the nineteen other soldiers whoremained waited for the aerial warriors to report back. It shouldn’t takelong, broomsticks were fast and the distances in the forest were notgreat—Two broomsticks approached, at speed, from the direction of Draco’scamp, and all the soldiers tensed. They weren’t executing the maneuversthat were today’s code for a friendly broomstick.“Scatter and fire!” roared General Potter, and then suited action towords, scurrying off at top speed toward the forest cover; and then assoon as Harry was among the trees, he spun back, raised his wand, triedto seek out the broomstick in the sky—“Clear!” shouted a voice. “They’re heading back!”Harry gave a mental shrug. There’d been no way to prevent Dracofrom obtaining that information, and he’d only learn that they’d beenstanding still.And the Chaotics slowly emerged from the forest—“Broomstick approaching from Granger’s direction!” yelled anothervoice. “I think it’s Green Leader, he did the dip and roll!”Moments later Theodore Nott dived out of the sky and pulled up inthe midst of the soldiers.“Granger has divided her forces in two!” yelled Nott as he hovered onhis broomstick. There was sweat staining his uniform, and all the reservewas gone from his voice. “She’s attacking both armies! Two brooms covering each force, they pursued me halfway here!”Divided her army, what on Earth—A large force concentrating fire on a small force could deplete thatforce rapidly without taking much damage in return. If twenty soldiersfaced ten soldiers, twenty sleep spells would be aimed at the ten soldierswith only ten sleep spells going the other way, so unless every one of thosefirst sleep spells hit its target, the smaller force would lose more peoplethan they could manage to take down with them. Defeated in detail was themilitary term for what happened when you divided your forces like that.What could Hermione possibly be thinking…Then Harry realized.She’s being fair.It was going to be a long year in Defense class.“All right,” Harry said loudly, so the army could hear. “We’ll wait untilthe Red Wing reports in, and then we’ll go cloud up some Sunshine.”Draco listened to the flyers’ reports with his face calm, all his shock concealed inside. What could Granger possibly be thinking?Then Draco realized.It’s a feint.One of Sunshine’s two forces would change direction, and both wouldconverge on… who?Neville Longbottom marched through the forest toward the approachingSunny force, occasionally glancing up at the sky for broomsticks. Besidehim marched his squad comrades, Melvin Coote and Lavender Brown of520 *Gryffindor, and Allen Flint of Slytherin. Allen Flint was their Squad Suggester, though Harry had first said to Neville, in private, that the positionwas his if he wanted it.Harry had said quite a lot of things to Neville in private, starting with“You know, Neville, if you want to become as awesome as the imaginaryNeville who lives in your head but isn’t allowed to do anything becauseyou’re scared, then you really should sign up for Professor Quirrell’sarmies.”Neville was now sure the Boy-Who-Lived could read minds. There wasjust no other way Harry Potter could’ve known. Neville had never talkedabout that with anyone, or given any sign; and other people weren’t likethat, not that Neville had ever noticed.And Harry’s promise had come true, this did feel different from sparring in Defense class. Neville had hoped that sparring would fix everything that was wrong with him, and, well, it hadn’t. Even if he could firea few spells at another student in class with Professor Quirrell watchingto make sure nothing went wrong, even if he could dodge and fire backwhen it was allowed and everyone else was expecting it and they would stareat him funny if he didn’t do it, none of that was the same as being able tostand up for himself.But being part of an army…Something strange was stirring inside Neville, as he marchedthrough the forest alongside his comrades, upon their uniforms aninsignia of fingers poised to snap.He was allowed to walk if he wanted to, but he just felt like marching.Beside him, Melvin and Lavender and Allen all seemed to feel likemarching too.And Neville softly began to sing the Song of Chaos.The tune was what a Muggle would have identified as John Williams’sImperial March, also known as “Darth Vader’s Theme”; and the wordsHarry had added were easy to remember.Doom doom doomDoom doom doom doom doom doomDoom doom doomDoom doom doom doom doom doomDoom doom doomDoom doom doom-doom-doom doom doomDoom doom-doom-doom doom doomDoom doom doom, doom doom doom.By the second line the others had joined in, and soon you could hearthe same soft chant coming from nearby parts of the forest.And Neville marched alongside his fellow Chaos Legionnaires,strange feelings stirring in his heart,imagination becoming reality,as from his lips poured a fearful song of doom.Harry stared at the bodies scattered across the forest. Something insidehim felt a bit queasy, and he had to remind himself hard that they wereonly sleeping. There were girls among the fallen, and that made it a lotworse somehow, and he would have to be careful never to mention thatin front of Hermione or the Aurors would find his remains stuffed into asmall teapot.Half of Sunshine army hadn’t put up much of a fight against all ofChaos. The nine ground soldiers had run in screaming inarticulately withSimple Shields raised, circular screens to protect their faces and chests.But you couldn’t fire and hold the shield at the same time, and Harry’ssoldiers had simply aimed for the legs. All but one of the Sunnies hadfallen over as soon as the cries of “Somnium!” filled the air. That last onehad dropped her shield and managed to take out one of Harry’s soldiersbefore being hit by the second wave of sleep spells (the Sleep Hex was safefor multiple hits). The two Sunny broomsticks had been much harder totake down and had accounted for three Chaotics before being auraed bymassed ground fire.522 *Hermione wasn’t among the fallen. Draco must have gotten her andthat was making Harry feel angry on some completely incomprehensiblelevel, he wasn’t sure if he was feeling protective toward Hermione, orcheated that he hadn’t been the one to do it, or maybe both.“All right,” Harry said, raising his voice. “Let’s everyone be clear onone thing, that wasn’t a real fight. That was General Granger making amistake in her first battle. Today’s actual fight is with Dragon Army andit’s not going to be anything like this. It’s going to be a lot more fun. Let’smove out.”A broomstick fell out of the sky, approaching terrifyingly fast, and spunon its end and decelerated so hard you could almost hear the air screaming in protest, and came to a halt directly beside Draco.It wasn’t dangerous showing-off. Gregory Goyle simply was that goodand he didn’t waste time.“Potter’s coming,” Gregory said with no trace of his usual fake drawl.“They’ve still got all four of their brooms, you want me to take them out?”“No,” Draco said sharply. “Fighting over their army gives them toomuch of an advantage, they’ll fire on you from the ground and even youmight not be able to dodge it all. Wait until the forces engage.”Draco had lost four Dragons in exchange for twelve Sunnies. Apparently General Granger actually had been that incredibly stupid, thoughshe hadn’t been among the attackers, so Draco hadn’t gotten a chance totaunt her or ask her what in Merlin’s name she had been thinking.The true battle, they all knew, would be with Harry Potter.“Prepare yourselves!” roared Draco at his troops. “Stay together withyour mates, act as a unit, fire as soon as the enemy is in range!”Discipline against Chaos.It shouldn’t be much of a fight.523 *The adrenaline was pumping and pumping into Neville’s blood until hefelt like he could hardly breathe.“We’re closing in,” said General Potter in a voice barely loud enoughto carry to the whole army. “Time to spread out.”Neville’s comrades moved away from him. They would still supporteach other, but if you clustered together, the enemy would have a mucheasier time hitting you; fire aimed at one of your comrades might missand get you instead. You would be a lot harder to hit if you spread outand moved as fast as you could.The first thing General Potter had done, during their training session,was get them to fire on each other when both sides were running fast, orboth stood still and took time to aim, or one was moving and one wasstanding still—the reverse charm to the Sleep Hex was simple, thoughyou weren’t allowed to use it during real battles. General Potter had carefully recorded everything that happened, done some figuring and ciphering, and then announced that it made more sense for them to focus, noton slowing down to aim carefully, but on moving fast so they wouldn’tget hit.It still bothered Neville a little not to be marching side-by-side withhis comrades, but the scary battlecries they’d learned were already thundering in his head and that made up for a lot.This time, Neville silently vowed to himself, his voice was absolutelypositively not going to squeak.“Shields up,” said General Potter, “power to forward deflectors.”“Contego,” murmured the army, and the circular screens sprang intoexistence before their heads and chests.A sharp taste filled Neville’s mouth. General Potter wouldn’t have ordered them to cast shields unless they were almost in range. Neville couldsee the uniformed shapes of Dragons moving through the dense screensof trees, and the Dragons would be seeing them as well—“Attack!” came a cry from the distance, the voice of Draco Malfoy, andGeneral Potter bellowed, “Charge—”All the adrenaline in Neville’s blood was unleashed, and his legs tookover, sending him flying faster than he’d ever run before, straight toward524 *the enemy, knowing without needing to look that all his comrades weredoing the same.“Blood for the blood god!” screamed Neville. “Skulls for the skull throne! Ia!Shub-Niggurath! The enemy’s gate is sideways!”There was a soundless impact as a sleep spell wasted itself againstNeville’s shield. If there’d been other spells fired, they hadn’t hit.Neville saw the brief look of fear on Wayne Hopkins’s face, as he stoodbesides two Gryffindors Neville didn’t recognize, and then——Neville dropped the Simple Shield and fired at Wayne——missed——his racing legs went straight past the enemy grouping and towardanother three Dragons, their wands coming up on him, their mouthsopening——not even thinking about it, Neville dived down to the forest floorjust as three voices cried “Somnium!”It hurt, hard stones and hard twigs digging into Neville as he rolled,it wasn’t as bad as falling off his broomstick but he’d still hit the groundpretty hard, and then Neville, with sudden insight, lay still and closed hiseyes.“Stop that!” screamed a voice. “Don’t shoot us, we’re Dragons!”With a flash of glorious satisfaction, Neville realized that he’d managed to get between two groups of Dragons just as one group had firedon him. Harry had talked about this as a tactic for making the enemyafraid to fire, but apparently it worked a bit better than that.And not only that, the Dragons believed they’d gotten him, since they’dseen Neville fall just as they fired.Neville counted to twenty inside his head, then opened his eyes acrack.The three Dragons were very near him, heads spinning rapidly ascries of “Somnium!” and “Skulls for the skull throne!” filled the air aroundthem. All three had Simple Shields up now.Neville’s wand was still in his hand, and it didn’t take much effort topoint it at one boy’s boots and whisper “Somnium.”Neville quickly closed his eyes and relaxed his hand as he heard theboy fall to the ground.525 *“Where’d it come from?” screamed Justin Finch-Fletchley’s voice, andNeville heard rustles on the leafy forest floor, as of two Dragons spinningaround looking for an enemy.“Reform ranks!” bellowed Malfoy’s voice. “To me, everyone, don’t let themscatter you!”Neville’s ears heard the two Dragons actually jump over his pronebody as they ran off.Neville opened his eyes, pushed himself to his feet a bit painfully, andthen pointed his wand and said the new charm that General Potter hadtaught them all. They couldn’t do real illusion spells to confuse the enemy,but even at their age they could—“Ventriliquo,” whispered Neville, pointing the wand to one side ofJustin and the other boy, and then yelled, “For Cthulhu and glory!”Justin and the other boy stopped abruptly, turning their shields toward where Neville had moved his battlecry, and that was when multiplecries of “Somnium!” filled the air and the other boy dropped before Nevillewas finished aiming.“The last one’s mine!” yelled Neville, and then he started sprintingstraight toward Justin, who’d been mean to him until the older Hufflepuffs straightened him out. Neville was surrounded by his comradesand that meant—“Special attack, Chaotic Leap!” howled Neville as he ran, and felt hisbody lighten, then lighten twice again, as his comrades got their wandsturned toward him and quietly cast the Hover Charm, and Neville raisedhis left hand and snapped his fingers and then used his legs to pushoff the ground as hard as he could and soared through the air. Sheershock painted Justin’s face as Neville went over the other boy’s shieldand pointed his wand down at the form passing beneath him and cried“Somnium!”Because he’d felt like it, that was why.Neville didn’t quite get his feet turned around properly and ratherplowed into the ground as he landed, but two out of three of the otherChaos Legionnaires had managed to hold their wands on him throughout and he didn’t hit very hard.526 *And Neville got to his feet, panting. He knew he should be moving,people were yelling “Somnium!” all over the place—“I am Neville, the last scion of Longbottom!” screamed Neville to the skyabove, holding his wand pointed straight up as though to challenge theblazing blue heaven itself, knowing that nothing after this day would everbe the same again. “Neville of Chaos! Face me if you da—”(When Neville woke up afterward, he was told that Dragon Army hadtaken this as their cue to counterattack.)The girl beside Harry slumped to the ground, taking the shot meant forhim, and he could hear Mr. Goyle’s distant gloating laugh as his broomstick blasted past them, cutting the air so hard it should have shatteredin his wake.“Luminos!” cried one of the boys next to Harry, who hadn’t been ableto rebuild the magical strength fast enough to do it earlier, and Mr. Goyledodged it without a pause.Chaos had only six soldiers left, now, and Dragon Army had two, andthe only problem was that one of those soldiers was invincible, and theother one was using up three soldiers just to cover him inside his shield.They’d lost more soldiers to Mr. Goyle than all the other Dragons puttogether, he was weaving and dodging through the air so fast that no onecould hit him, and he could shoot people while he did that.Harry had thought of all sorts of ways to stop Mr. Goyle but none ofthem were safe, even using the Hover Charm to slow him down (it wasa continuous beam and much easier to aim) wouldn’t be safe because hemight fall off the broomstick, throwing things in his way wouldn’t be safe,and that was getting harder and harder to remember as Harry’s bloodfroze over.It’s a game. You’re not trying to kill him. Don’t throw away all your futureplans for a game…Harry could see the pattern, he could see how Mr. Goyle was weaving,he could see how and when they all needed to fire in order to create a web527 *of shots that Mr. Goyle wouldn’t be able to dodge, but he just hadn’t beenable to explain it fast enough to his soldiers, they couldn’t coordinate theirshots well enough, and now they didn’t have enough people left to do it—I refuse to lose, not like this, not my whole army to one soldier!Mr. Goyle’s broomstick turned faster than anything should have beenable to turn and started to angle in toward Harry and his surviving troops,he could sense the boy beside him tensing, getting ready to throw himselfin front of his general.Harry’s wand came up, focusing on Mr. Goyle, Harry’s mind visualized the pattern, and Harry’s lips opened and his voice screamed—“Luminosluminosluminosluminosluminosluminosluminosluminosluminosluminosluminosluminos—”When Harry’s eyes opened again, he found himself resting in a comfortable position with his hands folded over his chest, holding his wand likea fallen hero.Slowly, Harry sat up. His magic was aching, a strange sensation butnot an entirely unpleasant one, much like the burn and lethargy that followed hard physical exercise.“The general’s awake!” cried a voice, and Harry blinked and focusedin that direction.Four of his soldiers held their wands on a shimmering prismatic hemisphere, and Harry realized that the battle wasn’t over. Right… he hadn’tbeen hit by a Sleep Hex, just exhausted himself, so when he woke up, hewas still in the game.Harry suspected he was going to get a lecture from someone-or-otherabout not exhausting his magic to the point of unconsciousness over achildren’s game. But he hadn’t hurt Mr. Goyle when he’d lost his temper,and that was the important thing.Then Harry’s mind clicked on another implication, and he lookeddown at the steel ring on his left hand’s pinky finger, and almost swore528 *out loud when he saw that the tiny diamond was missing and there wasa marshmallow lying on the ground near where he’d fallen.He’d sustained that Transfiguration for seventeen days, and wouldnow need to start over.Could’ve been worse. He could’ve done this fourteen days later, afterProfessor McGonagall had approved him to Transfigure his father’s rock.That was one very good lesson to learn the easy way.Note to self: Always remove ring from finger before completely exhaustingmagic.Harry pushed himself up, making rather hard going of it. Using upyour magic didn’t exhaust your muscles, but dodging around trees certainly did.He staggered over to the iridescent hemisphere that contained DracoMalfoy, who was holding his wand aloft to sustain the shield, and smilingcoldly at Harry.“Where’s the fifth soldier?” said Harry.“Um…” said a boy whose name Harry couldn’t remember at the moment. “I fired a Sleep Hex at the shield and it bounced off and hit Lavender, I mean the angle shouldn’t have been right but it did…”Draco was smirking inside the shield.“So let me guess,” Harry said, looking Draco directly in the eyes,“those neat little trios are the formation used by professional magicalmilitaries? Made up of trained soldiers who can easily hit moving targetsif their own hands are steady, and who can combine their defensivepowers so long as they stay together? Unlike your soldiers?”The smirk had vanished from Draco’s face, which was now hard andgrim.“You know,” Harry said lightly, knowing that none of the others wouldunderstand the real message passing between them, “it just goes to showthat you should always question everything you see your role models doing, and ask why it’s being done, and whether it makes sense in contextfor you to do it too. Don’t forget to apply that advice to real life, by theway. And thanks for the slow-moving clustered targets.”Because Draco had already gotten that lecture, and, Harry suspected,discounted it out of suspicion that Harry was trying to shift his loyalties529 *further away from pureblood tradition. Which of course Harry was. Butthis example would make an excellent excuse, next Saturday, to claimthat questioning authority was a merely practical technique for real life.And Harry would also mention the experiments he’d run, first with individuals and then with groups, to check that his ideas about the importance of speed had actually been correct, by way of hammering home thepoint of Draco needing to keep an eye out at all times for chances to applythe methods in everyday practice.“You haven’t won yet, General Potter!” snarled Draco. “Maybe we’llrun out of time, and Professor Quirrell will call it a draw.”A fair and worrisome point. The war only ended when Professor Quirrell, in his personal judgment, decided one army had won by practicalreal-world standards. There was no formal victory condition, ProfessorQuirrell had explained, because then Harry would figure out how to gamethe rules. Harry had to admit this was a fair cop.And Harry couldn’t blame Professor Quirrell for not calling an end,because it was plausible that the last soldier of Dragon Army could takeout all five survivors of the Chaos Legion.“All right,” Harry said. “Does anyone know anything about GeneralMalfoy’s shield spell?”It developed that Draco’s shield was a version of the standard Protegowhich had several disadvantages, the most important of which was thatthe shield couldn’t move with the caster.The upside—or from Harry’s perspective, downside—was that it waseasier to learn, easier to cast, and much easier to sustain for long times.They would need to hammer the shield with attack spells in order tobring it down.And Draco could apparently exert some control over the angle of reflection at which the spells would bounce off.The thought occurred to Harry that they could use WingardiumLeviosa to pile up heavy rocks on the shield until Draco couldn’t sustainit against the pressure… but then the rocks might fall in afterward andhit Draco, and injuring the enemy general for real was not among today’sgoals.530 *“So,” said Harry. “Are there such things as specialized shield-piercingspells?”There were.Harry asked if any of his soldiers knew them.No one did.Draco was smirking again, inside his shield.Harry asked if there was any sort of attack spell that wouldn’t bounce.Lightning bolts, it seemed, were usually absorbed by shields insteadof bouncing off them.…No one knew how to cast any sort of lightning-related spell.Draco sniggered.Harry sighed.He quite deliberately laid his wand on the ground.And Harry announced, with some weariness in his voice, that hewould just go ahead and take down the shield himself, using somemethod that would remain mysterious; and everyone else was to fire onDraco as soon as his shield went down.The Chaos Legionnaires looked nervous.Draco looked calm, which was to say, controlled.A thin, folded blanket came out of Harry’s pouch.Harry sat down next to the shimmering shield, and pulled the blanketover his head so no one could see what he did—except Draco, of course.From Harry’s pouch came a car battery and a set of jumper cables.…it wasn’t like he’d been about to leave the Muggle world to start anew era of magical research, and not take along any way of generatingelectricity.Shortly after, the Chaos Legionnaires heard the sound of fingerssnapping, followed by a crackling noise from beneath the blanket. Theshield started glowing more brightly, and Harry’s voice said, “Don’t bedistracted please, eyes on General Malfoy.”The strain was showing on Draco’s face, along with the fury and annoyance and frustration.Harry smiled up at him, and mouthed, Tell you later.And that was when a spiral of green energy shot out of the forest andsmashed into Draco’s shield, which shrieked like pieces of sharp glass being rubbed together, and Draco staggered.In sudden, frantic panic, Harry took the jumper cables off the batteryand fed them into the pouch, then he fed the battery itself into the pouch,and then he tore off the blanket and grabbed his wand and stood up.All of his soldiers were still there and glancing around frantically.“Contego,” Harry said, and his soldiers followed suit, but Harry didn’teven know which direction the shield ought to be pointing in. “Did anyone see where that came from?” Shaken heads. “And General Malfoy,would you mind telling me if you got General Granger?”“Why yes,” Draco said acidly, “I mind.”Oh, hell.Harry’s mind began calculating, Draco inside the shield, Draco wornout now to some degree, Harry worn out too, Hermione in the woodswho-knew-where, Harry and four other Chaotics left…“You know, General Granger,” Harry said out loud, “you reallyshould’ve waited to attack until after I’d fought General Malfoy. Youmight’ve been able to get all the survivors.”From somewhere came a girl’s high-pitched laughter.Harry froze.That wasn’t Hermione.And that was when the dreadful, eerie, cheerful chant began to rise,coming from all around them.“Don’t be frightened, don’t be sad,We’ll only hurt you if you’re bad…”“Granger cheated!” burst out Draco inside the shield. “She woke up hersoldiers! Why doesn’t Professor Quirrell—”“Let me guess,” Harry said, the sickness already churning in his stomach. He really hated losing. “It was a very easy battle, right? They droppedlike flies?”“Yes,” Draco said. “We got them all on the first shot—”The look of horrified realization spread from Draco to the Chaos Legionnaires.“No,” Harry said, “we didn’t.”532 *Camouflaged forms were appearing from among the trees.“Allies?” Harry said.“Allies,” Draco said.“Good,” said General Granger’s voice, and a spiral of green energyblazed out of the woods and shattered Draco’s shield to splinters.General Granger surveyed the battlefield with a definite feeling of satisfaction. She was down to nine Sunshine Soldiers, but that was probablyenough to handle the last survivor of the enemy forces, especially whenParvati and Anthony and Ernie were already holding their wands on General Potter, whom she’d ordered taken alive (well, conscious).It was Bad, she knew, but she’d really really really wanted to gloat.“There’s a trick, isn’t there?” said Harry, the strain showing in hisvoice. “There has to be some trick. You can’t just turn into a perfect general. Not on top of everything else. You’re not that Slytherin! You don’twrite creepy poetry! No one’s that good at everything!”General Granger glanced around at her Sunshine Soldiers, and thenlooked back at Harry. Everyone was probably watching this on thescreens outside.And General Granger said, “I can do anything if I study hard enough.”“Oh now that’s just bu—”“Somnium.”Harry slumped to the ground in mid-sentence.“SUNSHINE WINS,” intoned the huge voice of Professor Quirrell,seeming to come from everywhere and nowhere.“Niceness has triumphed!” cried General Granger.“Hooray!” shouted the Sunshine Soldiers. Even the Gryffindor boyssaid it, and they said it with pride.“And what’s the moral of today’s battle?” said General Granger.“We can do anything if we study hard enough!”And the survivors of the Sunshine Regiment marched off toward thevictory field, singing their marching song as they went:533 *Don’t be frightened, don’t be sad,We’ll only hurt you if you’re bad,And send you to a home that’s true,With new friends to watch over you,Be sure to tell them you were sentBy Granger’s Sunshine Regiment!534 *Aftermaths:Harry paced backward and forward in his general’s office, whichmade a wonderful room for pacing, it didn’t have any other uses as far ashe could tell.How?How?Hermione shouldn’t have won that battle! Not on her first try, notwhen she wasn’t at all violent by her nature, automatically being a greatmilitary commander on top of everything else was too much even for her.Had she read about the tactic in a military history book? But it hadn’tbeen just that one tactic, she’d had her forces perfectly positioned to blockany retreat, her troops had been better coordinated than his or Draco’s…Had Professor Quirrell broken his promise not to help her? Had hegiven her the diary of General Tacticus or something?Harry was missing something here, something really important, andhis mind went around and around in circles, and he still couldn’t figureit out.Finally Harry sighed. He wasn’t getting anywhere on this, and he hadto go learn the Breaking Drill Hex from Hermione or someone before thenext battle—Professor Quirrell had explained to Harry, his voice amusedbut with a sharp undertone of warning, that “no magical items exceptthe ones I give you” included Muggle technology no matter how much535 *that wasn’t magic. Plus Harry also needed to figure out how to bring downMr. Goyle next time…Battles counted for a lot of Quirrell points if you were a general, andHarry needed to get cracking if he wanted to win Professor Quirrell’sChristmas wish.In his private room at Slytherin, Draco Malfoy stared off into space, asthough the wall in front of his desk was the most fascinating surface inthe world.How?How?In retrospect it had been an obvious sort of idea as cunning plots went,but Granger wasn’t supposed to be cunning! She’d been too much of a Hufflepuff to use a Simple Strike Hex! Had Professor Quirrell been advisingher despite his promise, or…And then Draco finally did what he should have done much earlier.What he should have done after the first time he met with Granger.What Harry Potter had told him to do, trained him to do, and yet Harryhad also warned Draco that it would take time to make his brain realizethat the methods applied to real life, and Draco hadn’t understood that until today. He could have avoided every single one of his mistakes if he’djust applied the things Harry had already told him—Draco said out loud, “I notice that I am confused.”Your strength as a rationalist is your ability to be more confused by fictionthan by reality…Draco was confused.Therefore, something he believed was fiction.Granger should not have been able to do all that.Therefore, she probably hadn’t.I promise not to help General Granger in any way that the two of you don’tknow about.With sudden horrified realization, Draco swept papers out of the way,hunting through the mess on his desk, until he found it.536 *And there it was.Right in the list of people and equipment assigned to each of the threearmies.Curse Professor Quirrell!Draco had read it and he still hadn’t seen it—The afternoon sunlight poured down into the office of the Sunshine Regiment, illuminating General Granger in her chair as though she glowedwith a golden aura.“How long do you think it will take Malfoy to figure it out?” said General Granger.“Not long,” said Colonel Blaise Zabini. “He may have already. Howlong will it take Potter to figure it out?”“Forever,” said General Granger, “unless Malfoy tells him, or one ofhis own soldiers realizes. Harry Potter just doesn’t think like that.”“Really?” said Captain Ernie Macmillan, looking up from one ofthe corner tables where he was being crushed at chess by Captain RonWeasley. (They’d brought back all the other chairs after Malfoy had left,of course.) “I mean it seems kind of obvious to me. Who would try tocome up with all the ideas just by themselves?”“Harry,” said Hermione, at exactly the same time Zabini said, “Malfoy.”“Malfoy thinks he’s way better than everyone else,” said Zabini.“And Harry… doesn’t really see most other people like that,” said Hermione.It was kind of sad, actually. Harry had grown up very, very alone. Itwasn’t that he went around thinking in words that only geniuses had aright to exist. It just wouldn’t occur to him that anyone in Hermione’sarmy besides Hermione could have any good ideas.“Anyhow,” Hermione said. “Captains Goldstein and Weasley, you’reon duty for thinking up strategic ideas for our next battle. CaptainsMacmillan and Susan—sorry, I mean Macmillan and Bones—try to537 *come up with some tactics we can use, also any training you think weshould try. Oh, and congratulations on your marching song, CaptainGoldstein, I think it was a big plus for esprit de corps.”“What’re you doing?” said Susan. “And Colonel Zabini?”Hermione stood up out of her chair, stretching. “I’ll try to figure outwhat Harry Potter is thinking and Colonel Zabini will try to figure outwhat Draco Malfoy might do, and both of us will join you again after wecome up with something. I’m going to walk while I think. Zabini, youwant to come along?”“Yes, General,” said Zabini stiffly.It hadn’t been meant as an order. Hermione sighed to herself a little. This was going to take some getting used to, and although Zabini’sfirst idea had certainly worked, she wasn’t quite sure that Professor Quirrell’s quote mixture of positive and negative incentives unquote wouldbe enough to keep the Slytherin fully on her side until December whentraitors would be allowed for the first time…She still had no idea what she was going to do with Professor Quirrell’s Christmas wish, either. Maybe she’d just ask Mandy if she wantedanything, when the time came around.538 *ut Headmaster,” Harry argued, some of his desperation leaking intohis voice, “leaving all of my assets in one undiversified vault full ofgold coins—it’s crazy, Headmaster! It’s like, I don’t know, doing Transfiguration experiments without consulting a recognized authority! Youjust don’t do that with money!”From the lined face of the old wizard—underneath a festive holidayhat like a catastrophic automobile collision between cars of green and redcloth—a grave, sad look peered out at Harry.“I’m sorry, Harry,” said Dumbledore, “and I do apologize, but allowingyou control over your own finances would give you far too much independence of action.”Harry’s mouth opened and no sound came out. He was, literally,speechless.“I will permit you to withdraw five Galleons for Christmas presents,”said Dumbledore, “which is more than any boy your age should spend,but poses no threat, I think—”“I can’t believe you just said that!” the words burst out of Harry’s mouth.“You admit to being that manipulative?”“Manipulative?” said the old wizard, smiling slightly. “No, manipulative would be if I did not admit it, or if I had some deeper motive behindthe obvious. This is quite straightforward, Harry. You are not yet ready toplay the game, and it would be foolish to allow you thousands of Galleonswith which to upset the gameboard.”539 *The bright hustle and bustle of Diagon Alley had increased by a hundredfold and redoubled as Christmas approached, with all the shopsenshrouded in brilliant sorceries that flashed and sparkled as though theseason’s spirit was about to blaze out of control and turn the whole areainto a cheerful holiday crater. The streets were so crowded with witchesand wizards in festive and loud clothing that your eyes were assaultedalmost as severely as your ears; and it was clear, from the bewildering variety of the shoppers, that Diagon Alley was considered an internationalattraction. There were witches wrapped in giant swathes of cloth liketoweled mummies, and wizards in formal top hats and bath-robes, andyoung children barely past toddling age who were decorated with lightsthat blazed almost as bright as the shops themselves, as their parentstook them hand in hand through that magic wonderland and let themshriek to their heart’s content. It was the season to be merry.And in the midst of all that light and cheer, a note of blackest night; acold, dark atmosphere that cleared a few precious paces of distance evenin the midst of all that crush.“No,” said Professor Quirrell, with a look of grim revulsion, like he’djust bitten into food that not only tasted horrible but was morally repugnant to boot. It was the sort of grim face an ordinary person might makeafter biting into a meat pie, and discovering that it was rotten and hadbeen made from kittens.“Oh, come on,” Harry said. “You must have some ideas.”“Mr. Potter,” Professor Quirrell said, his lips set in a thin line, “Iagreed to act as your adult guardian on this expedition. I did not agree toadvise you on your choice of presents. I don’t do Christmas, Mr. Potter.”“How about Newtonmas?” Harry said brightly. “Isaac Newton actually was born on December 25th, unlike some other historical figures Icould name.”This failed to impress Professor Quirrell.“Look,” said Harry, “I’m sorry, but I’ve got to do something special forFred and George and I’ve got no idea of my options.”540 *Professor Quirrell made a thoughtful humming sound. “You couldask which family members they most dislike, and then hire an assassin. Iknow someone from a certain government-in-exile who is quite competent, and he would give you a discount on multiple Weasleys.”“This Christmas,” Harry said, dropping his voice into a lower register,“give your friends the gift… of death.”That made Professor Quirrell smile. It went all the way to his eyes.“Well,” said Harry, “at least you didn’t suggest getting them a petrat—” Harry’s mouth snapped shut, and he was regretting the wordsalmost as soon as they were out of his mouth.“Pardon me?” said Professor Quirrell.“Nothing,” Harry said at once, “long dumb story.” And telling itseemed wrong somehow, maybe because Harry was afraid ProfessorQuirrell would have laughed even if Bill Weasley hadn’t been cured andeverything put back to right…And where had Professor Quirrell been that he’d never heard the story?Harry had gotten the impression that everyone in magical Britain knew.“Look,” said Harry, “I’m trying to solidify their loyalty to me, you know?Make the Weasley twins my minions? Like the old saying goes: A friendisn’t someone you use once and then throw away, a friend is someoneyou use over and over again. Fred and George are two of the most useful friends I have in Hogwarts, Professor Quirrell, and I plan to use themover and over again. So if you’d help me be Slytherin here, and suggestsomething they might be very grateful for…” Harry’s voice trailed off invitingly.You just had to pitch these things the right way.They walked on for a good way before Professor Quirrell spoke again,his voice practically dripping with distaste. “The Weasley twins are usingsecondhand wands, Mr. Potter. They would be reminded of your generosity with every Charm they cast.”Harry clapped his hands together in involuntary excitement. Just putthe money on account at Ollivander’s, and tell Mr. Ollivander to neverrefund it—no, better yet, to send it to Lucius Malfoy if the Weasley twinsdidn’t show up before the start of their next school year. “That’s brilliant,Professor!”Professor Quirrell did not look like he appreciated the compliment.“I suppose I can tolerate Christmas in that spirit, Mr. Potter, though onlybarely.” Then he smiled slightly. “Of course that will cost you fourteenGalleons, and you only have five.”“Five Galleons,” Harry said, with a sniff of outrage. “Just who does theHeadmaster think he’s dealing with, anyway?”“I think,” said Professor Quirrell, “that it simply did not occur to himto fear the consequences if you turned your ingenuity to the task of obtaining funds. Though you were wise to lose, rather than making it anexplicit threat. Out of curiosity, Mr. Potter, what would you have doneif I hadn’t turned away in boredom while you, in a fit of childish pique,counted out five Galleons worth of Knuts?”“Well, the easiest way would’ve been to borrow money from DracoMalfoy,” said Harry.Professor Quirrell chuckled briefly. “Seriously, Mr. Potter.”Duly noted. “Probably I’d have done a few celebrity appearances. Iwouldn’t resort to anything economically disruptive just for spendingmoney.” Harry had checked, and he would be allowed to keep the TimeTurner while he went home for the holidays, so that his sleep cycle didn’tstart to rotate. But then it was also possible that someone kept an eye outfor magical day traders. The gold and silver trick would’ve taken workon the Muggle end, and seed funding, and the goblins might’ve gottensuspicious after the first cycle. And starting a real bank would be a lot ofwork… Harry hadn’t quite worked out any money-making methods thatwere fast and certain and safe, so he’d been very glad when ProfessorQuirrell had turned out to be so easily fooled.“I do hope those five Galleons will be enough to last, since you countedthem so carefully,” said Professor Quirrell. “I doubt the Headmaster shallbe so eager to entrust me with your vault key a second time, once he discovers I’ve been tricked.”“I’m sure you did your best,” Harry said with deep gratitude.“Do you need any assistance finding a safe place to store all thoseKnuts, Mr. Potter?”“Well, sort of,” said Harry. “Do you know of any good investment opportunities, Professor Quirrell?”542 *And the two of them walked on, in their tiny sphere of silence andisolation, through the brilliant and bustling crowds; and if you lookedcarefully, you would see that where they went, leafy boughs faded, andflowers withered, and children’s toys that played cheerful bells changedto lower and more ominous notes.Harry did notice, but he didn’t say anything, just smiled a little to himself.Everyone had their own way of celebrating the holidays, and theGrinch was as much a part of Christmas as Santa.543 *he terrifying part was how fast the whole thing had spiraled out ofcontrol.“Albus,” Minerva said, not even trying to keep the worry out of hervoice as the two of them entered the Great Hall, “something has to bedone.”The atmosphere at Hogwarts before Yuletide was usually bright andcheerful. The Great Hall had already been decorated in green and red, after a Slytherin and a Gryffindor whose Yule wedding had become a symbol of friendship transcending Houses and allegiances, a tradition almostas ancient as Hogwarts itself and which had even spread to Muggle countries.Now the students eating dinner were glancing nervously over theirshoulders, or sending vicious glares at other tables, or at some tables arguing heatedly. You could have described the atmosphere as tense, perhaps, but the phrase coming to Minerva’s mind was fifth degree of caution.Take a school, into four Houses divided…Now into each year, add three armies at war.And the partisanship of Dragon and Sunshine and Chaos had spreadbeyond the first-years; they had become the armies for those who had noarmies. Students were wearing armbands with insignia of fire or smile orupraised hand, and hexing each other in the corridors. All three first-yeargenerals had told them to stop—even Draco Malfoy had heard her out andthen nodded grimly—but their supposed followers hadn’t listened.545 *Dumbledore gazed out at the tables with a distant look. “In every city,”the old wizard quoted softly,“the population has been divided for a long timepast into the Blue and the Green factions… And they fight against their opponentsknowing not for what end they imperil themselves… So there grows up in themagainst their fellow men a hostility which has no cause, and at no time does it ceaseor disappear, for it gives place neither to the ties of marriage nor of relationship norof friendship, and the case is the same even though those who differ with respectto these colours be brothers or any other kin. I, for my part, am unable to call thisanything except a disease of the soul…”“I’m sorry,” said Minerva, “I don’t—”“Procopius,” said Dumbledore. “They took their chariot-racing veryseriously, in the Roman Empire. Yes, Minerva, I agree that somethingmust be done.”“Soon,” Minerva said, her voice lowering even further. “Albus, I thinkit must be done before Saturday.”On Sunday, most students would leave Hogwarts to stay the holidaywith their families; Saturday, then, was the final battle of the three firstyear armies that would determine the awarding of Professor Quirrell’sthrice-cursed Christmas wish.Dumbledore glanced over at her, studying her gravely. “You fear thatthe explosion will come then, and someone will be hurt.”Minerva nodded.“And that Professor Quirrell will be blamed.”Minerva nodded again, her face tight. She had long since becomewise in the ways that Defense Professors were fired. “Albus,” Minervasaid, “we cannot lose Professor Quirrell now, we cannot! If he but staysthrough January our fifth-years will pass their OWLs, if he stays throughMarch our seventh-years will pass their NEWTs, he is remedying years ofneglect in months, a whole generation will grow up able to defend themselves in spite of the Dark Lord’s curse—you must stop the battle, Albus!Ban the armies now!”“I am not sure the Defense Professor would take that kindly,” saidDumbledore, glancing over toward the Head Table where Quirrell wasdrooling into his soup. “He did seem most attached to his armies, thoughwhen I agreed I thought there would be four in each year.” The old wizard546 *sighed. “A clever man, probably with the best of intentions; but perhapsnot clever enough, I fear. And to ban the armies might also trigger theexplosion.”“But then Albus, what will you do?”The old wizard favored her with a benign smile. “Why, I shall plot, ofcourse. It’s the new fashion in Hogwarts.”And they had come too close to the Head Table for Minerva to say anything more.The terrifying part was how fast the whole thing had spiraled out of control.The first battle in December had been… messy, or so Draco had heard.The second battle had been deranged.And the next one would be worse, unless the three of them togethersucceeded in their last desperate attempt to stop it.“Professor Quirrell, this is insanity,” Draco said flatly. “This isn’tSlytherin any more, it’s just...” Draco was at a loss for words. He wavedhis hands helplessly. “You can’t possibly do any real plots with all thisstuff going on. Last battle, one of my soldiers faked his own suicide.We have Hufflepuffs trying to plot, and they think they can, but theycan’t. Things just happen at random now, it doesn’t have anything to dowith who’s cleverest, or which army fights best, it’s…” He couldn’t evendescribe it.“I agree with Mr. Malfoy,” said Granger in the tones of someonewho hadn’t ever expected to hear herself saying those words. “Allowingtraitors isn’t working, Professor Quirrell.”Draco had tried forbidding anyone in his army to plot except him, andthat had just driven the plots underground, no one wanted to be left outwhen the soldiers in other armies got to plot. After miserably losing theirlast battle, he’d finally given in and revoked his decree; but by then hissoldiers had already started setting their own personal plans in motion,without any sort of central coordination.547 *After being told all the plans, or what his soldiers claimed were theirplans, Draco had tried to sketch a plot to win the final battle. It had required considerably more than three different things to go right, andDraco had used Incendio on the paper and Everto to vanish the ashes, because if Father had seen it he would have been disowned.Professor Quirrell’s eyelids were half-closed, his chin resting on hishands as he leaned forward onto his desk. “And you, Mr. Potter?” saidthe Defense Professor. “Are you likewise in agreement?”“All we’d need to do is shoot Franz Ferdinand and we could startWorld War One,” said Harry. “It’s gone to complete chaos. I’m all for it.”“Harry!” said Draco in utter shock.He didn’t even realize until a second later that he’d said it at exactlythe same time, and in exactly the same tone of indignation, as Granger.Granger shot him a startled glance, and Draco carefully kept his faceneutral. Oops.“That’s right!” said Harry. “I’m betraying you! Both of you! Again!Ha ha!”Professor Quirrell was smiling thinly, though his eyes were still halfclosed. “And why is that, Mr. Potter?”“Because I think I can cope with the chaos better than Miss Granger orMr. Malfoy,” said the traitor. “Our war is a zero-sum game, and it doesn’tmatter whether it’s easy or hard in an absolute sense, only who does betteror worse.”Harry Potter was learning far too fast.Professor Quirrell’s eyes moved beneath their lids to regard Draco,and then Granger. “In truth, Mr. Malfoy, Miss Granger, I simply couldnot live with myself if I shut down the grand debacle before its climax.One of your soldiers has even become a quadruple agent.”“Quadruple?” said Granger. “But there’s only three sides in the war!”“Yes,” said Professor Quirrell, “you’d think that, wouldn’t you. I amnot sure that there has ever in history been a quadruple agent, or anyarmy with such a high fraction of real and pretended traitors. We areexploring new realms, Miss Granger, and we cannot turn back now.”Draco left the Defense Professor’s office with his teeth gritting hardagainst each other, and Granger looking even more annoyed beside him.548 *“I can’t believe you did that, Harry!” said Granger.“Sorry,” Harry said, not sounding sorry at all, his lips curved up in amerry smile of evil. “Remember, Hermione, it is just a game, and whyshould generals like us be the only ones who get to plot? And besides,what are the two of you going to do about it? Team up against me?”Draco traded glances with Granger, knowing that his own face was astight as hers. Harry had been relying, more and more openly and gloatingly, on Draco’s refusal to make common cause with a mudblood girl;and Draco was beginning to get sick of having that used against him. Ifthis kept up much longer he was going to ally with Granger just to crushHarry Potter, and see how much the son of a mudblood liked that.The terrifying part was how fast the whole thing had spiraled out of control.Hermione stared at the parchment Zabini had given her, feeling utterly and completely helpless.There were names, and lines connecting the names to other names,and some of the lines were in different colors and…“Tell me,” said General Granger, “is there anyone in my army who isn’ta spy?”The two of them weren’t in the office but in another, deserted classroom, and they were alone; because, Colonel Zabini had said, it was nownearly certain that at least one of the captains was a traitor. Probably Captain Goldstein, but Zabini didn’t know for sure.Her question had put an ironic smile on the young Slytherin’s face.Blaise Zabini always seemed a little disdainful of her, but he didn’t seemto actively dislike her; nothing like the derision he held for Draco Malfoy, or the resentment he had developed for Harry Potter. She had worried at first about Zabini betraying her, but the boy seemed desperate toshow that the other two generals were no better than him; and Hermione thought that while Zabini would probably be happy to sell her out toanyone else, he’d never let Malfoy or Harry win.549 *“Most of your soldiers are still loyal to you, I’m pretty sure,” said Zabini.“It’s just that no one wants to be left out of the fun.” The scornful look onthe Slytherin’s face made it clear what he thought of people who didn’ttake plotting seriously. “So they think they can be double agents and secretly work for our side while pretending to betray us.”“And that would also go for anyone in the other armies who says theywant to be our spy,” Hermione said carefully.The young Slytherin shrugged. “I think I did a good job of tellingwhich ones really want to sell out Malfoy, I’m not sure anyone really wantsto sell out Potter to you. But Nott is a sure bet for betraying Potter toMalfoy and since I had Entwhistle approach him supposedly on behalf ofMalfoy and Entwhistle really reports to us, that’s almost as good—”Hermione closed her eyes for a moment. “We’re going to lose, aren’twe?”“Look,” Zabini said patiently, “You’re in the lead right now on Quirrellpoints. We just have to not lose this last battle completely and you’ll haveenough Quirrell points to win the Christmas wish.”Professor Quirrell had announced that the final battle would operateon a formal scoring system, which he’d been asked to do to avoid recriminations afterward. Each time you shot someone, the general of your armygot two Quirrell points. A gong would ring through the battle area (theydidn’t know yet where they would be fighting, though Hermione was hoping for the forest again, where Sunshine did well) and its pitch would tellwhich army had won the points. And if anyone was faking being hit, thegong would ring out anyway, and then a double gong would ring later, after no fixed time, to hail the retraction. And if you called the name of anarmy, cried “For Sunshine!” or “For Chaos!” or “For Dragon!”, it switchedyour allegiance to that army…Even Hermione had been able to see the flaw in that set of rules. ButProfessor Quirrell had gone on to announce that if you’d been originallyassigned to Sunshine, nobody could shoot you in the name of Sunshine—or rather, they could, but then Sunshine lost a single Quirrell point, symbolized by a triple gong. That prevented you from shooting your own soldiers for points, and discouraged suiciding before the enemy got you, butyou could still shoot spies if you had to.550 *Right now, Hermione had two hundred and forty-four Quirrellpoints, and Malfoy had two hundred and nineteen, and Harry had twohundred and twenty-one; and there were twenty-four soldiers in eacharmy.“So we fight carefully,” Hermione said, “and just try not to lose toobadly.”“No,” said Zabini. The young Slytherin’s face was now serious. “Theproblem is, Malfoy and Potter both know that their only way to win is tocombine and crush us, then fight it out on their own. So here’s what Ithink we should do—”Hermione left the classroom in something of a daze. Zabini’s planhadn’t been the obvious one, it had been strange and complicated and layered and the sort of thing she would’ve expected Harry to come up with,not Zabini. It felt wrong just for her to be able to understand a plan likethat. Young girls shouldn’t be able to understand plans like that. The Hatwould’ve Sorted her into Slytherin, if it’d seen that she could understandplans like that…The awesome thing was how fast he’d been able to escalate the chaos oncehe started doing it deliberately.Harry sat in his office; he’d been given the authority to order furniturefrom the house elves, so he’d ordered a throne, and curtains in a blackand crimson pattern. Scarlet light like blood, mixed with shadow, pouredover the floor.Something in Harry felt like he’d finally come home.Before him stood the four Lieutenants of Chaos, his most trusted minions, one of whom was a traitor.This. This was what life should be like.“We are gathered,” said Harry.“Let Chaos reign,” chorused his four Lieutenants.“My hovercraft is full of eels,” said Harry.“I will not buy this record, it is scratched,” chorused his four Lieutenants.“All mimsy were the borogroves.”“And the mome raths outgrabe!”That concluded the formalities.“How goes the confusion?” Harry said in a dry whisper like EmperorPalpatine.“It goes well, General Chaos,” said Neville in the tone he always usedfor military matters, a tone so deep that the boy often had to stop andcough. The Chaotic Lieutenant was neatly dressed in his black schoolrobes, trimmed in the yellow of Hufflepuff House, and his hair was partedand combed in the usual look for an earnest young boy. Harry had likedthe incongruity better than any of the cloaks they’d tried. “Our Legionnaires have begun five new plots since yesterday evening.”Harry smiled evilly. “Do any of them have a chance of working?”“I don’t think so,” said Neville of Chaos. “Here’s the report.”“Excellent,” said Harry, and laughed chillingly as he took the parchment from Neville’s hand, trying his best to make it sound like he waschoking on dust. That brought the total to sixty.Let Draco try to handle that. Let him try.And as for Blaise Zabini…Harry laughed again, and this time it didn’t even take an effort tosound evil. He really needed to borrow someone’s pet Kneazle for his staffmeetings, so he’d have a cat to stroke while he did this.“Can the Legion stop making plots now?” said Finnigan of Chaos. “Imean, don’t we have enough already—”“No,” Harry said flatly. “We can never have enough plots.”Professor Quirrell had put it perfectly. They were pushing the boundaries further, perhaps, than they had ever been pushed; and Harrywouldn’t have been able to live with himself if he’d turned back now.There came a knock at the door.“That will be the Dragon General,” Harry said, smiling with evil prescience. “He arrives precisely as I expected. Do show him in, and yourselves out.”And the four Lieutenants of Chaos shuffled out, casting dark looks atDraco as the enemy general entered into Harry’s secret lair.552 *If he wasn’t allowed to do this when he was older, Harry was just goingto stay eleven forever.The sun was dripping through the red curtains, sending rays of blooddancing across the floor from behind Harry Potter’s grownup-sized cushioned chair, which he had covered in gold and silver glitter and insistedon referring to as his throne.(Draco was beginning to feel a lot more confident that he’d done theright thing in deciding to overthrow Harry Potter before he could takeover the world. Draco couldn’t even imagine what it would be like to liveunder his rule.)“Good evening, Dragon General,” said Harry Potter in a chill whisper.“You have arrived just as I expected.”This was not surprising, considering that Draco and Harry hadagreed on the meeting time in advance.And it also wasn’t evening, but by now Draco knew better than to sayanything.“General Potter,” Draco said with as much dignity as he could manage,“you know that our two armies have to work together for either of us to winProfessor Quirrell’s wish, right?”“Yesss,” hissed Harry, like the boy thought he was a Parselmouth. “Wemust cooperate to destroy Sunshine, and only then fight it out betweenus. But if one of us betrays the other earlier on, that one could gain anadvantage in the later fight. And the Sunshine General, who knows allthis, will try to trick each of us into thinking the other has betrayed them.And you and I, who know that, will be tempted to betray the other andpretend that it is Granger’s trickery. And Granger knows that, as well.”Draco nodded. That much was obvious. “And… both of us only wantto win, and there’s no one else who’ll punish either of us if we defect…”“Precisely,” said Harry Potter, his face now turning serious. “We arefaced with a true Prisoner’s Dilemma.”The Prisoner’s Dilemma, according to Harry’s teachings, ran thus:Two prisoners had been locked in separate cells. There was evidence553 *against each prisoner, but only minor evidence, enough for a prisonsentence of two years apiece. Each prisoner could opt to defect, betraythe other, testify against them in court; and this would take one yearoff their own prison sentence, but add two years to the other’s. Or aprisoner could cooperate, staying silent. So if both prisoners defected,each testifying against the other, they would serve three years apiece; ifboth cooperated, or stayed silent, they would serve two years each; but ifone defected and the other cooperated, the defector would serve a singleyear, and the cooperator would serve four.And both prisoners had to make their decision without knowing theother one’s choice, and neither would be given a chance to change theirdecision afterward.Draco had observed that if the two prisoners had been Death Eatersduring the Wizarding War, the Dark Lord would have killed any traitors.Harry had nodded and said that was one way to resolve the Prisoner’sDilemma—and in fact both Death Eaters would want there to be a DarkLord for exactly that reason.(Draco had asked Harry to stop and let him to think about this for awhile before they continued. It had explained a lot about why Father andhis friends had agreed to serve under a Dark Lord who often wasn’t niceto them…)In fact, Harry had said, this was pretty much the reason why peoplehad governments—you might be better off if you stole from someone else,just like each prisoner would be individually better off if they defectedin the Prisoner’s Dilemma. But if everyone thought like that, the countrywould fall into chaos and everyone would be worse off, like what wouldhappen if both prisoners defected. So people let themselves be ruled bygovernments, just like the Death Eaters had let themselves be ruled by theDark Lord.(Draco had asked Harry to stop again. Draco had always taken forgranted that ambitious wizards put themselves in power because theywanted to rule, and people let themselves be ruled because they werescared little Hufflepuffs. And this, on reflection, still seemed true; butHarry’s perspective was fascinating even if it was wrong.)But, Harry had continued afterward, the fear of a third party punish*554 *ing you was not the only possible reason to cooperate in the Prisoner’sDilemma.Suppose, Harry had said, you were playing the game against a magically produced identical copy of yourself.Draco had said that if there were two Dracos, of course neither Dracowould want anything bad to happen to the other one, not to mention thatno Malfoy would let himself become known as a traitor.Harry had nodded again, and said that this was yet another solutionto the Prisoner’s Dilemma—people might cooperate because they caredabout each other, or because they had senses of honor, or because theywanted to preserve their reputation. Indeed, Harry had said, it was ratherdifficult to construct a true Prisoner’s Dilemma—in real life, people usually cared about the other person, or their honor or their reputation or aDark Lord’s punishment or something besides the prison sentences. Butsuppose the copy had been of someone completely selfish—(Pansy Parkinson had been the example they’d used)—so each Pansy only cared what happened to her and not to the otherPansy.Given that this was all Pansy cared about… and that there was no DarkLord… and Pansy wasn’t worried about her reputation… and Pansy eitherhad no sense of honor or didn’t consider herself obligated to the otherprisoner… then would the rational thing be for Pansy to cooperate, or defect?Some people, Harry said, claimed that the rational thing to do was forPansy to defect against her copy, but Harry, plus someone named Douglas Hofstadter, thought these people were wrong. Because, Harry hadsaid, if Pansy defected—not at random, but for what seemed to her likerational reasons—then the other Pansy would think exactly the same way.Two identical copies wouldn’t decide different things. So Pansy had tochoose between a world in which both Pansies cooperated, or a world inwhich both Pansies defected, and she was better off if both copies cooperated. And if Harry had thought ‘rational’ people did defect in the Prisoner’s Dilemma, then he wouldn’t have done anything to spread that kindof ‘rationality’, because a country or a conspiracy full of ‘rational’ peoplewould dissolve into chaos. You would tell your enemies about ‘rationality’.555 *Which had all sounded reasonable at the time, but now the thought wasoccurring to Draco that…“You said,” Draco said, “that the rational solution to the Prisoner’sDilemma is to cooperate. But of course you would want me to believe that,wouldn’t you?” And if Draco was fooled into cooperating, Harry wouldjust say, Ha ha, betrayed you again! and laugh at him about it afterward.“I wouldn’t fake your lessons,” Harry said seriously. “But I have to remind you, Draco, that I didn’t say you should just automatically cooperate. Not on a true Prisoner’s Dilemma like this one. What I said was thatwhen you choose, you shouldn’t think like you’re choosing for just yourself, or like you’re choosing for everyone. You should think like you’rechoosing for all the people who are similar enough to you that they’ll probably do the same thing you do for the same reasons. And also choosingthe predictions made by anyone who knows you well enough to predictyou accurately, so that you never have to regret being rational becauseof the correct predictions that other people make about you—remind meto explain about Newcomb’s Problem at some point. So the question youand I have to ask, Draco, is this: are we similar enough that we’ll probablydo the same thing whatever it is, making our decisions in mostly the sameway? Or do we know each other well enough to predict each other, so thatI can predict whether you’ll cooperate or defect, and you can predict thatI’ve decided to do the same thing I predict you’ll do, because I know thatyou can predict me deciding that?”…and Draco could not help but think that since he had to strain justto understand half of that, the answer was obviously ‘No’.“Yes,” said Draco.There was a pause.“I see,” said Harry, sounding disappointed. “Oh, well. I guess we’llhave to think of some other way, then.”Draco hadn’t thought that was going to work.Draco and Harry talked about it back and forth. They had both agreedmuch earlier that what they did on the battlefield would not count as broken promises in real life—though Draco was a little angry about whatHarry had done in Professor Quirrell’s office, and said so.556 *But if the two of them couldn’t rely on honor or friendship, thatdid leave the question of how to get their armies to work together onbeating Sunshine, despite everything Granger might try to break themup. Professor Quirrell’s rules didn’t make it tempting to let Sunshine killthe other army’s soldiers—that just increased the bar you had to passyourself—but it did tempt each side to steal kills instead of acting like asingle army would, or to shoot some of the other side’s soldiers duringthe confusion of battle…Hermione was walking back to Ravenclaw not really looking where shewas going, her mind preoccupied with war and treachery and other ageinappropriate concepts, and she turned a corner and bumped straightinto a grownup.“Sorry,” she said automatically, and then, entirely without thinking,“Eeeeek!”“Don’t worry, Miss Granger,” said the cheerful smile, set beneaththe twinkling eyes, and above the silver beard, of the HEADMASTER OFHOGWARTS. “You are quite forgiven.”Her gaze was helplessly locked on the kindly face of the most powerfulwizard in the world, who was also the Chief Warlock, who was also theSupreme Mugwump, who had gone insane years ago from the stress offighting the Dark Lord, and numerous other facts that were popping upinto her mind one after the other while her throat went on making littleembarrassing squeaks.“In fact, Miss Granger,” said Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, “it is quite lucky that we bumped into each other. Why, I was justnow wondering curiously what the three of you were thinking of askingfor your wishes…”Saturday dawned bright and clear and with the students speaking inhushed voices, as though the first to shout might set off the explosion.557 *Draco had hoped that they would be fighting in the upper levels of Hogwarts again. Professor Quirrell had said that real fights were more likelyto take place in cities than forests, and fighting inside schoolrooms andcorridors was supposed to simulate that, with ribbons to mark the allowed areas. Dragon Army had done well in those fights.Instead, just as Draco had feared, Professor Quirrell had come upwith something special for this battle.The battleground was the Hogwarts Lake.And not in boats, either.They were fighting underwater.The Giant Squid had been temporarily paralyzed; spells had been setin place to keep away the grindylows; Professor Quirrell had gone andtalked to the merfolk; and all the soldiers had been issued potions of underwater action that allowed them to breathe, see clearly, talk to each other,and swim not quite as fast as a fast walk by kicking their legs.A huge silver sphere hung in the center of the battleground, shining like a small underwater moon. It would help to provide a sense ofdirection—at first. The moon would slowly go into eclipse as the battlewent on, and when it had gone entirely dark, the battle would end if ithadn’t already.War in water. You couldn’t defend a perimeter, attackers could comeat you from any direction, and even with the potion you couldn’t see veryfar in the darkness of the lake.And if you swam too far away from the action, you would start to glowafter a while, and be easy to hunt down—ordinarily if an army scatteredand ran instead of fighting, Professor Quirrell would just declare themdefeated; but today they were working on a points system. Of course youstill had some time before you started to glow, if you wanted to play assassin.Dragon Army had been set low in the water at the start of the game;above and far away, the distant underwater moon shone. The murky water was mostly lit by Lumos Charms, though his soldiers would extinguish558 *the lights as soon as they began maneuvers. There was no point in lettingthe enemy see you before you saw them.Draco kicked his legs a few times, propelling him to a higher positionfrom which he could gaze down at where his soldiers hovered in the water.The conversations died down almost at once under Draco’s icy glare,his soldiers looking up at him with gratifying expressions of fear andworry.“Listen to me very carefully,” said General Malfoy. His voice came outa little lower, a little burbly with bubbles, libsten to me vebwy caerbfully, butthe sound traveled clearly. “There’s only one way we can win this. We’vegot to march on Sunshine together with Chaos, and beat Sunshine. Thenwe fight it out with Potter and win. That’s got to happen, understand? Nomatter what else goes on, that part has to happen that way—”And Draco explained the plan he and Harry had come up with.Astonished looks were exchanged among the soldiers.“—and if any of your plots get in the way of that,” finished Draco, “after we are out of the water, I will set you on fire.”There was a nervous chorus of yessirs.“And everyone with secret orders, make sure you carry them out to theletter,” said Draco.Around half his soldiers openly nodded, and Draco marked them fordeath after he rose to power.Of course all the private orders were fake, like one Dragon being toldto offer a false traitor’s commission to another Dragon, and the secondDragon being told in hushed confidence to report anything said by thefirst Dragon. Draco had told each Dragon that the whole war could depend on that one thing, and that he hoped they understood it was moreimportant than the plans they’d previously made. With luck that wouldkeep all the idiots happy, and maybe flush out a few spies to boot, if thereports didn’t match the instructions.Draco’s real plan for winning against Chaos… well, it was simpler thanthe one he’d burned, but Father still wouldn’t have liked it. Despite trying,though, Draco hadn’t been able to think of anything better. It was a plotthat couldn’t possibly have worked against anyone except Harry Potter. In559 *fact it had been Harry’s plan originally, according to the traitor, thoughDraco had guessed that without being told. Draco and the traitor hadjust modified it a little…Harry took a deep breath, feeling the water gurgle harmlessly in his lungs.They’d fought in the forest, and he hadn’t gotten a chance to say it.They’d fought in the corridors of Hogwarts, and he hadn’t gotten achance to say it.They’d fought in the air, broomsticks issued to every soldier, and itstill hadn’t made sense to say it.Harry had thought he wouldn’t ever get to say those words, not whilehe was still young enough for them to be real…The Chaos Legionnaires were looking at Harry in puzzlement, as theirgeneral swam with his feet pointing up toward the distant light of thesurface, and his head pointed down toward the murky depths.“Why are you upside down?” the young commander shouted at his army,and began to explain how to fight after you abandoned the privileged orientation of gravity.A hollow, booming bell echoed through the water, and on the instant,Zabini and Anthony and five other soldiers struck out downward, into themurky depths of the lake. Parvati Patil, the only Gryffindor in the group,turned her head back for a moment and gave them all a cheery wave asshe dived; and after a moment, Scott and Matt did the same. The rest justsank and vanished.General Granger swallowed a lump in her throat as she watched themgo. She was risking everything on this, dividing her army instead of justtrying to take as many enemy soldiers with them as possible.The thing to realize, Zabini had told her, was that no army wouldmove until they had a plan that let them expect victory. Sunshine couldn’t560 *just plan to win themselves, they had to make both other armies think theywould win until it was too late.Ernie and Ron still looked like they were in shock. Susan was gazingafter the disappearing soldiers with a calculating look. Her army, whatwas left of it, just looked bewildered, traceries of light dappling on theiruniforms as they all drifted just below the sunlit surface of the lake.“Now what?” said Ron.“Now we wait,” said Hermione, loudly enough for all the soldiers tohear. It felt odd to talk with her mouth full of water, she kept feeling likeshe was committing some sort of horrible impoliteness at the dinner table and was about to drool all over herself. “All of us left here are going toget zapped, but that was going to happen anyway with Dragon and Chaosganging up on us. We’ve just got to take as many of them with us as wecan.”“I’ve got a plan,” said one of her Sunshine Soldiers… Hannah, her voicehad been a little hard to recognize at first. “It’s like all complicated, but Iknow how we can get Dragon and Chaos to start fighting each other—”“Me too!” said Fay. “I’ve got a plan too! See, Neville Longbottom issecretly on our side—”“You were talking to Neville?” said Ernie. “That’s not right, I was theone who—”Daphne Greengrass and a couple of other Slytherins who hadn’t gonewith Zabini were giggling helplessly as the cries of “No, wait, I was theone who got Longbottom” erupted from one soldier after another.Hermione just looked at them all wearily.“Okay,” said Hermione when it had all died down, “does everyoneget it? All your plots were faked by the Chaos Legion, or maybe someby Dragon. Anyone who really wanted to betray Harry or Malfoy wentstraight to me or Zabini, not you. Just go ahead and compare notes onall your secret plots and you’ll see it for yourselves.” She might not beas good at plotting as Zabini, but she could always understand what allher officers told her, that was why Professor Quirrell had made her thegeneral. “So don’t bother trying to do any plots when the other armiesget here. Just fight, okay? Please?”“But,” said Ernie with shock on his face, “Neville is in Hufflepuff! You’resaying he lied to us?”Daphne was laughing so hard and so helplessly that the exhalationshad turned her upside down in the water.“I’m not sure what Longbottom is,” said Ron darkly, “but I don’t thinkhe’s a Hufflepuff any more. Not now that Harry Potter’s got to him.”“Do you know,” said Susan, “I asked him that, and Neville told me hehad become a Chaos Hufflepuff?”“Anyway,” said Hermione in a loud voice. “Zabini took with everyonewho we thought was a spy, so in our army we can stop watching each otherquite so hard now, I hope.”“Anthony was a spy?” yelled Ron.“Parvati was a spy?” gasped Hannah.“Parvati was totally a spy,” said Daphne. “She shopped at the spy shoestore and wore spy lipstick, and someday she’s going to marry a nice spyhusband and have a lot of little spies.”And then a gong sound echoed through the water, indicating thatSunshine had just scored two points.This was shortly followed by the triple gong of Dragon losing a singlepoint.Traitors weren’t allowed to kill generals, not after the disaster of thefirst battle in December when all three generals had been shot in the firstminute. But with any luck…“Aw,” said Hermione. “It sounds like Mr. Crabbe is taking a little nap.”Like two shoals of fish, the armies swam along.Neville Longbottom kicked his feet in slow, measured motions. Diving, always diving in whatever direction you happened to be moving. Youwanted to show the enemy the smallest profile, present them with yourhead or your feet. So you were always diving, downward and head-first,and the enemy was always down.562 *Like every Chaos Legionnaire in the army, Neville’s head was constantly rotating as he swam, looking up, down, around, to every side.Not just watching for Sunshine Soldiers, but watching for any sign that aChaos Legionnaire had drawn their wand and was about to betray them.Usually traitors waited until the confusion of battle to make their move,but that early gong had put them all on guard.…the truth was, Neville was feeling sad about that. In November he’dbeen a soldier in a united army, all of them pulling together and helpingeach other, and now they were all watching each other constantly for thefirst signs of betrayal. It might have been more fun for General Chaos,but it wasn’t nearly as much fun for Neville.The direction formerly known as ‘up’ was getting steadily brighter, asthey came closer to the surface and Sunshine.“Wands out,” said General Chaos.Neville’s squad drew their wands, pointing them straight ahead toward the enemy, as their heads scanned around more rapidly. If therewere Sunny traitors, the time was approaching for them to strike.The other shoal of fish, Dragon Army, was doing the same thing.“Now!” shouted the distant voice of the Dragon General.“Now!” shouted General Chaos.“For Sunshine!” shouted all the soldiers in both armies, and chargeddownward.“What?” said Minerva involuntarily as she watched the screens from nextto the lake, a cry echoed in many other places; all of Hogwarts was watching this battle as they had watched the first.Professor Quirrell was laughing dryly. “I warned you, Headmaster. Itis impossible to have rules without Mr. Potter exploiting them.”For long precious seconds, as the forty-seven soldiers charged her ownseventeen, Hermione’s mind went blank.563 *Why…Then it all snapped into place.Every time a soldier originally from Sunshine got shot by someonecrying the name of Sunshine, she would lose a Quirrell point. When twoSunshine Soldiers were shot by either army, both enemy armies would betwo points closer to overtaking her, it was the same gain only shared. Andif anyone shot another soldier not in the name of Sunshine, that gongwouldn’t get lost in the confusion…Hermione was suddenly very glad that Zabini hadn’t gone with theobvious plan of starting trouble between the other two armies while theyattacked Sunshine.It was still disheartening, though, that sense of your chances closingdown, of hope being taken away.Most of Hermione’s soldiers were still looking confused, but somehad expressions of dawning horror as they got it.“It’s all right,” Susan Bones said firmly. Heads turned to look at theSunshine Captain. “Our job is the same, to take as many of them withus as we can. And remember, Zabini took away all the spies! We don’thave to stay on the lookout like they do!” The girl was smiling defiantly,provoking answering smiles from many of the other soldiers, even fromHermione herself. “It can be like it was in November. We just have tokeep our heads high, fight our best, and trust each other—”Daphne shot her.“Blood for the blood god!” shrieked Neville of Chaos, though since he wasunderwater it came out more like ‘Blubbled for the blubbled glub!’Captain Weasley spun and raised his wand toward Neville and fired.But Neville was swimming downward toward him, wand pointed straightahead, and that meant the Simple Shield could shelter Neville’s entire profile; if anyone shot him now, it wasn’t going to be Sunny Ron.A grimly determined look came over Captain Weasley’s face, and hearrowed straight up toward Neville, mouthing the word Contego, thoughthe shield wasn’t visible in the water.564 *The two enemy champions shot toward each other like arrows released from bows, each aimed to split the other down the middle. Theyhad dueled many times before, but this time would pay for all.(Far away by the lakeside, a hundred breaths were held.)“Rainbows and unicorns!” roared the Sunshine Captain.“The Black Goat with a thousand young!”“Do your homework!”Closer and yet closer, the two champions charged, neither willing toswerve, the first person to turn would present a vulnerable broadside andget shot, though if neither lost their nerve they would crash right intoeach other…Falling straight down as the enemy rose straight up to meet him, hammer descending to meet anvil in a path neither was willing to leave…“Special attack, Chaotic Twist!”Neville saw the look of horror on Captain Weasley’s face as the HoverCharm caught him. They’d tested it before the battle had started; and justas Harry had suspected, Wingardium Leviosa became a whole new sort ofweapon once everyone was swimming underwater.“Curse you, Longbottom!” shrieked Ron Weasley, “Can’t you ever fightwithout your dumb special attacks—”and by that time the Sunshine Captain had been spun around sideways and Neville shot him in the leg.“I don’t fight fair,” said Neville to the sleeping form, “I fight like HarryPotter.”Granger: 237 / Malfoy: 217 / Potter: 220It still hurt every time he had to shoot Hermione. Harry could hardlystand to look at the expression of peace that had come over her sleepingface, arms now drifting aimlessly as the curves of sunlight moved overher camouflage uniform and the cloud of her chestnut hair.And if Harry had tried to duck out of being the one to shoot her… notonly would Draco have known what it meant, Hermione would have beenoffended.565 *She’s not dead, Harry said to his brain as his kicking feet pushed himaway, she’s just resting. IDIOT.Are you sure? said his brain. What if she’s an ex-Hermione? Could we goback and check?Harry glanced back briefly.See, she’s fine, there are bubbles coming out of her mouth.Could’ve been her last breath escaping.Oh be quiet. Why are you being so paranoid-protective, anyway?Er, first real friend we’ve ever had in our whole life? Hey, remember whathappened to our pet rock?Would you SHUT UP about that worthless lump of rubble, it wasn’t even alivelet alone sentient, that is like the most pathetic childhood trauma ever—The two armies swiftly separated, becoming two shoals of fish oncemore.General Granger had gone down seventeen points, and taken threeChaotics and two Dragons with her; and one Chaotic and two Dragonshad been shot as traitors. So she’d lost net seven points, Harry had lostone, Draco had lost two; that put Sunshine twenty points up on Dragon,and seventeen points up on Chaos. Chaos could still win easily if theyexterminated all twenty remaining Dragons. The wild card, of course,being those seven remaining Sunshine Soldiers……if you could call them that.The two shoals swam uneasily next to each other, the soldiers in eacharmy awaiting an order to call out their true allegiances, and attack…“Everyone who got them,” Harry said loudly, “remember Special Orders One through Three. And don’t forget it’s Merlin Says on Three. Donot acknowledge.”The trustworthy two-thirds of the army did not nod, and the otherthird just looked puzzled.Special Order One: Don’t bother trying to call out any codewords in this battle, don’t expend effort on any plot not specially approved by the commander; justswim, shield, and fire.Hermione and Draco had both been fighting their soldiers, trying toget them to stop plotting on their own all through December. Harry hadegged his soldiers on and supported their plotting through the last two566 *battles… while also telling them that at some future point he might askthem to put a plot or two on hold, to which they’d all readily agreed. Sonow, in this critical battle, they were happy to obey.Neither Hermione or Draco could have given that order successfully,Harry was certain. It was the difference between your soldiers seeing youas an ally in their plotting, and seeing you as a spoilsport old fuddy-duddywho didn’t want them to have any fun. Imposition of order equaled escalation of chaos, and it also worked in reverse…“There they are!” shouted someone, and pointed.From the depths of the lake arose the forgotten ones, the ones who’dforsaken the last battle, the seven missing Sunshine Soldiers, glowingwith the bright aura of cowards, now fading as they returned to battle.The two shoals of fish wavered, pointing wands uneasily.“Hold your fire!” shouted Harry, and a similar cry came from GeneralMalfoy.There was a moment of held breath.Then the seven Sunshine Soldiers swam up to join Dragon Army.There was a triumphant cheer from Dragon Army.There were cries of dismay from a third of the Chaos Legion.Some of the other two-thirds smiled, though they shouldn’t have.Harry wasn’t smiling.Oh, this is so completely not going to work…But Harry hadn’t been able to think of anything better.“Special Orders Two and Three still apply!” shouted Harry. “Fight!”“For the Chaos Legion!” roared twenty Chaotic Legionnaires.“For Dragon Army!” roared twenty Dragon Warriors and seven Sunshine Soldiers.And the Chaotics dived straight downward, as all the traitors gotready to strike.Granger: 237 / Malfoy: 220 / Potter: 226567 *Draco’s head darted around frantically, trying to weigh up whatwas happening; somehow, despite his greater forces, he’d lost the initiative. Four small Chaotic forces were being pursued by four largerDragon forces, but because Draco’s forces were the ones trying to forcean engagement, it meant that they had to follow where Chaos ran, andsomehow that was producing concentrations of Chaotic force that wouldfire into the exposed sides of Dragon—It was happening again!“Prismatis!” shouted Draco, raising his wand, and that shield youcould see even through the water, a sparkling multicolored flat wall wideenough to shield Draco and the five other Dragons with him from theChaotic force that had just started firing on them as they swam past, andthat let the other five Dragons turn their attentions back to the Chaoticforce they’d been chasing—There was a tense moment as sleep spell after sleep spell crashed intoDraco’s Prismatic Wall, and Draco was hoping to Merlin that none ofthose four Chaotics had learned the Breaking Drill Hex—Then there was the bell of a Dragon victory, and the Chaotic forcespun head-for-foot and began swimming away; and Draco, his handsnow shaking slightly, dropped the Prismatic Wall and lowered his wand.Fighting in water was more exhausting even than fighting on broomsticks.“Do not pursue!” Draco cried to his soldiers as they started to follow,then, “Sonorus! REFORM ON ME!”The Dragon forces started converging on Draco, and the Chaoticforces spun around and began pursuing the Dragons on the instant—Draco swore out loud as he heard the bell of a Chaotic victory, someonehadn’t gotten their Simple Shield oriented right—and then the Dragonforces were in supporting range of each other and the Chaotics weremoving back into the murky distance.Somehow, despite their numerical superiority, the Dragons hadscored three times against the Chaotics and the Chaotics had scoredfour times back, and he’d heard one Dragon spy get executed. EitherHarry Potter had thought of a lot of very good ideas very fast, or for someunimaginable reason he’d already spent a lot of time working out how568 *to fight underwater. This wasn’t working, and Draco needed to rethinkthings.It looked like everyone was having trouble aiming while swimming,too, the battle might last long enough that time would be called… the distant underwater moon was only half full now, that wasn’t good… he hadto rethink things fast…“What is it?” said Padma Patil, as she and her force swam over towardDraco.Padma was his second-in-command; she was clever and powerful,and better yet, she hated Granger and saw Harry as a rival, which madeher trustworthy. Working with Padma was making him realize the truthof the old adage that Ravenclaw was sister to Slytherin; Draco had beensurprised when his father had told him it was an acceptable House forhis future wife, but now he saw the sense of it.“Wait until we’re all here,” Draco said. The truth was, he needed tocatch his breath. That was the trouble with being the general and the mostpowerful wizard, you had to keep using magic.Zabini came in next, commanding a force of two Sunnies and fourDragons, one of whom was Gregory keeping an eye on Zabini. Dracodidn’t trust Zabini. And neither Draco nor Zabini trusted the Sunniesenough to make them a majority of any unit; they were supposed to beloyal either to Draco directly, or to Granger who’d been fooled by thepromise that the Dragons would be betrayed in the end after both forceshad been depleted, just as Harry’s more trusted Chaotics should’ve beenfooled into not shooting at the Sunnies by the promise of their firing fakeSleep Hexes and switching to support Chaos later; but it was possiblesome of the Sunnies were loyal to Chaos and weren’t firing real SleepHexes and that was why Dragon wasn’t winning the way their numericaladvantage should’ve let them win…The next unit that approached was depleted, three soldiers holdingwands on two other soldiers, who were swimming with empty hands.Draco gritted his teeth. More traitor problems. He needed to talk toProfessor Quirrell about having some way to punish traitors at least, conditions like these were unrealistic, in real life you tortured your traitors todeath.569 *“General Malfoy!” shouted the commander of the problem unit asit swam up, a Ravenclaw boy named Terry. “We don’t know what todo—Cesi shot Bogdan, but Cesi says Kellah told him that Bogdan shotSpecter—”“I didn’t!” said Kellah.“Yes you did!” shrieked Cesi. “General Malfoy, she’s the spy, I should’verea—”“Somnium,” said Draco.There was the triple bell of a one-point loss from Dragon, and thenKellah’s limp body began to float away in the water.Draco had heard the word ‘recursion’ by this point, and he knew aHarry Potter plot when he saw one.(Unfortunately Draco had not heard of autoimmune disorders, andthe thought did not readily occur to him that a clever virus would beginits attack by creating symptoms of an autoimmune disorder so as to getthe body to distrust its own immune system…)“General order!” said Draco, raising his voice. “Nobody gets to shootspies except myself, Gregory, Padma, and Terry. If anyone sees anythingsuspicious they come to one of us.”And then—There was the bell of Sunshine scoring two points.“What?” said Draco and Zabini around the same time; their headsswiveled around. No one seemed to have gotten hit, and all the Sunshinesoldiers were present and accounted for. (Except Parvati, who had beenshot by some still-unknown traitor in Padma’s squad; and of coursePadma had shot Parvati again in case she was faking, so it wasn’t her…)“A Sunny traitor in Chaos?” said Zabini, sounding puzzled. “But allthe ones I knew about were supposed to strike during Chaos’s attack onSunshine—”“No!” said Padma in a tone of sudden realization. “That was Chaosexecuting a spy!”“What?” said Zabini. “But why—”And Draco got it. Damn it! “Because Potter thinks he’s safe for howmuch he beats Sunshine, but not for how much he beats us! So he doesn’twant to lose a single point when he executes a traitor! General order! If you570 *have to execute a traitor, call Sunshine first! And don’t forget to switchback to Dragon afterward—”Granger: 253 / Malfoy: 252 / Potter: 252Longbottom’s body drifted chaotically through the water, arms andlegs disarrayed. After Draco had finally got a hit in they’d all shot himagain just to be sure.Nearby was Harry Potter, now protected by a Prismatic Sphere, looking at them all grimly as the last sliver of crescent moon slowly diminished, somewhere far away. If Longbottom had managed to shoot onemore soldier (Draco knew Harry was thinking), if the two Chaotics hadmanaged to hold out just a little longer, they might have won…After Draco had reformed his forces and struck out again, the ensuing battle and execution of spies in Sunshine’s name had left Sunshine exactly one point ahead of Dragon and Chaos both. Once Harry had starteddoing it, Draco had been left with no choice but to follow suit.But now they had General Chaos outnumbered three to one, the survivors of Dragon Army and the last remaining Sunny traitor: Draco, andPadma, and Zabini.And Draco, who was no fool, had ordered Padma to take Zabini’swand after Longbottom had shot Gregory and fallen in turn to Draco.The boy had given him an insulted look, told Draco that he owed him forthis, and handed it over.That left Draco and Padma to take down General Chaos.“I don’t suppose you’d like to surrender?” said Draco, smiling as evillyas any smile he’d ever directed at Harry Potter.“Sleep before surrender!” shouted General Chaos.“Just so you know,” said Draco, “Zabini doesn’t actually have an oldersister for you to rescue from Gryffindor bullies. But Zabini does have amother who doesn’t approve of Muggleborns like Granger, and I wroteher a few notes, and offered Zabini a few favors—nothing involving myfather, just things I can do in school. And by the way, Zabini’s motherdoesn’t approve of the Boy-Who-Lived, either. Just in case you stillthought Zabini was really on your side.”Harry’s face grew even grimmer.Draco raised his wand, and began breathing rhythmically, buildingup strength for a Breaking Drill Hex. Granger’s Prismatic Sphere wasalmost as strong as Draco’s now, and Harry’s wasn’t much weaker, wheredid those two find time?“Lagann!” spoke Draco, putting everything he had into it, and thegreen spiral blazed out and Harry’s shield shattered, and at almost thesame moment—“Somnium!” said Padma.Granger: 253 / Malfoy: 252 / Potter: 254Harry let out a long breath of relief, and not just because he didn’thave to hold the Prismatic Sphere any more. His hand was shaking as helowered his wand.“You know,” said Harry, “I was pretty worried there for a moment.”Special Order Two: If a Sunny traitor doesn’t seem to be really shooting at you,fake being hit occasionally. Prefer targeting Dragons to Sunnies but go ahead andshoot Sunnies if you can’t shoot Dragons.Special Order Three: Merlin says do not shoot at Blaise Zabini or either Patiltwin.With a wide grin, Parvati Patil stripped the Transfigured patch off heruniform’s insignia, and let it float away in the water.“Gryffindors for Chaos,” she said, and handed Zabini his wand back.“Thank you very much,” Harry said, and bowed sweepingly to the Gryffindor girl. “And thank you as well,” bowing to Zabini. “You know, whenyou came to me with that plan, I wondered if you were brilliant or crazy,and I’ve decided that you’re both. And by the way,” Harry said, now turning as though to address Draco’s body, “Zabini does have a cousin—”“Somnium,” said Zabini’s voice.572 *Granger: 255 / Malfoy: 252 / Potter: 254And Harry Potter’s body floated away, his expression of shock and horror quickly relaxing into sleep.“On second thought,” Parvati said cheerfully, “make that Gryffindorsfor Sunshine.”She started to laugh, more exhiliarated than she’d ever been in her life,she’d finally gotten to assassinate and replace her twin sister and she’dwanted to do that since forever, and this had been perfect, it had all beenperfect——and then her wand spun around in a lightning motion just asZabini’s wand turned to point at her.“Wait!” said Zabini. “Do not shoot, do not resist. That’s an order.”“What?” said Parvati.“Sorry,” said Zabini, looking not-quite-sincerely apologetic, “but Ican’t be totally sure you’re for Sunshine. So I order you to let me shootyou.”“Hold on!” said Parvati. “We’re only ahead of Chaos by one point! Ifyou shoot me now—”“I’ll shoot you in the name of Dragon, obviously,” said Zabini, nowsounding a little superior. “Just because we tricked them into doing it,doesn’t mean it won’t work for us.”Parvati stared at him, her eyes narrowing. “General Malfoy said yourmother doesn’t like Hermione.”“I suppose,” said Zabini, still with that superior smirk. “But some ofus are more willing than Draco Malfoy to annoy a parent.”“And Harry Potter said you have a cousin—”“Nope,” said Zabini.Parvati stared at him, trying to think, but she wasn’t really good atplotting; Zabini’d said the plan was to secretly keep the scores of Chaosand Dragon as even as possible so they’d use Sunshine’s name to execute their traitors instead of losing even a single point, and that hadworked… but… she had the feeling she was missing something, she wasn’ta Slytherin…573 *“Why don’t I shoot you in the name of Dragon?” said Parvati.“Because I outrank you,” said Zabini.Parvati had a bad feeling about this.She stared at him for a long moment.And then—“Somni—” she started to say, and then realized she hadn’t said forDragon, and frantically cut herself off—Granger: 255 / Malfoy: 254 / Potter: 254“Hey, everyone,” said Blaise Zabini’s face on the screens, looking quiteamused, “guess it’s all down to me.”All by the lakeside, people were holding their breath.Sunshine was ahead of Dragon and Chaos by exactly one point.Blaise Zabini could shoot himself in the name of either Dragon orChaos, or just leave things the way they were.A series of chimes indicated that the last minute of time was runningout.And the Slytherin was smiling a strange, twisted smile, and casuallytoying with his wand, the dark wood barely visible in the dark water.“You know,” said Blaise Zabini’s voice, in the tones of someone who’dbeen rehearsing the words for a while, “it’s just a game, really. And gamesare supposed to be fun. So how about if I just do whatever I feel like?”574 *inerva and Dumbledore together had applied their combined talent to conjure the grand stage toward which Quirrell now slowlytrudged; it was, at its core, sturdy wood, but the outer surfaces shonewith glitter of marble inlaid with platinum and studded with gems of every House color. Neither she nor the Headmaster was any Founder ofHogwarts, but the conjuration only needed to last a few hours. Minervaordinarily enjoyed the few occasions when she had the occasion to tireherself out on large Transfigurations; she should have enjoyed the manysmall chances for artistry, and the illusion of opulence; but this time shehad done the work with the dreadful feeling of digging her own grave.But Minerva was feeling a little better now. There’d been one briefmoment when the explosion might’ve come; but Dumbledore had alreadybeen standing up and applauding warmly, and no one had proven foolishenough to riot in front of the Headmaster.And the explosive mood had rapidly faded into a collective sentimentwhich might perhaps have been described by the phrase: Give us a break!Blaise Zabini had shot himself in the name of Sunshine, and the finalscore had been 254 to 254 to 254.Behind the stage, waiting to ascend, three children were glaring at eachother in mingled fury and frustration. It didn’t help that they were stilldamp from being fished out of the lake, and that the Warming Charms575 *didn’t seem quite enough to make up for the crisp December air, ormaybe it was just their mood.“That’s it,” said Granger. “I’ve had it! No more traitors!”“I completely agree with you, Miss Granger,” Draco said icily.“Enough is enough.”“And what do you two intend to do about it?” snapped Harry Potter.“Professor Quirrell already said he wouldn’t ban spies!”“We’ll ban them for him,” said Draco grimly. He hadn’t even understood what he meant by the words as he said them, but the very act ofspeaking seemed to crystallize a plan—The stage really was well done, at least for a temporary structure; themakers hadn’t fallen into the usual pitfall of being impressed by theirown illusion of wealth, and knew something about architecture and visual style. From where Draco stood, in the obvious place for him to stand,the watching students would see him haloed in the faint glitter of emeralds; and Granger, standing where Draco had subtly motioned her, wouldbe haloed in Ravenclaw’s sapphire. As for Harry Potter, Draco wasn’t looking at him right now.Professor Quirrell had… awakened, or whatever it was he did; and wasleaning upon a platinum podium bare of all gems. With evident showmanship, the Defense Professor was carefully stacking and squaringthose three envelopes containing the three parchments upon which thethree generals had written their wishes, as all the students of Hogwartswatched, and waited.Finally Professor Quirrell looked up from the envelopes. “Well,” saidthe Defense Professor. “This is inconvenient.”A slight titter of laughter ran through the crowd, with a sharp undertone.“I suppose you are all wondering what I will do?” said Professor Quirrell. “There is nothing for it; I shall have to do what is fair. Although first576 *there was a little speech I wanted to make, and before even that, it appears to me that Mr. Malfoy and Miss Granger have something they wishto share.”Draco blinked, and then he and Granger traded rapid glances—mayI?—yes, go ahead— and Draco raised his voice.“General Granger and I would both like to say,” Draco said in his mostformal voice, knowing it was being amplified and heard, “that we will nolonger accept the help of any traitors. And if, in any battle, we find thatPotter has accepted traitors from either of our armies, we will join forcesto crush him.”And Draco shot a glance filled at malice at the Boy-Who-Lived. Takethat, General Chaos!“I agree completely with General Malfoy,” said Granger standing beside him, her high voice clear and strong. “Neither of us will use traitors,and if General Potter does, we will wipe him off the battlefield.”There was a susurration of surprise from the watching students.“Very good,” said their Defense Professor, smiling. “It took the two ofyou long enough, but you are still to be congratulated on having thoughtof it before any other generals.”It took a moment for this to soak in—“In the future, Mr. Malfoy, Miss Granger, before you come to my office with any request, consider whether there is a way for you to accomplish it without my help. I will not deduct Quirrell points on this occasion,but next time you may expect to lose the full fifty.” Professor Quirrellwore an amused grin. “And what do you have to say about that, Mr. Potter?”Harry Potter’s gaze went to Granger, then to Draco. His face appeared calm; though Draco was sure controlled would have been thebetter term.Finally Harry Potter spoke, his voice level. “The Chaos Legion is stillhappy to accept traitors. See you on the battlefield.”Draco knew the shock was showing on his own face; there were astonished murmurs from the watching students, and when Draco glanced atthe front row he saw that even Harry’s Chaotics looked taken aback.577 *Granger’s face was angry, and getting angrier. “Mr. Potter,” she saidin a sharp tone like she thought she was a teacher, “are you trying to beobnoxious?”“Most certainly not,” Harry Potter said calmly. “I won’t make you doit every time. Beat me once, and I’ll stay beaten. But threats aren’t alwaysenough, General of Sunshine. You did not ask me to join with you, buttried simply to impose your will; and sometimes you must actually defeatthe enemy, to impose your will on him. You see, I am skeptical that Hermione Granger, the brightest academic star of Hogwarts, and Draco, son ofLucius, scion of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy, can work together to beat their common foe, Harry Potter.” An amused smile crossedHarry Potter’s face. “Maybe I’ll just do what Draco tried with Zabini, andwrite a letter to Lucius Malfoy and see what he thinks about that.”“Harry!” gasped Granger, looking absolutely aghast, and there weregasps from the audience as well.Draco controlled the anger flushing through him. That had been astupid move on Harry’s part, saying that in public. If Harry had simplydone it, it might have worked, Draco hadn’t even thought about that,but now if Father did that it would look like he was playing into Harry’shands—“If you think my father, Lord Malfoy, can be manipulated by you thateasily,” Draco said coldly, “you have a surprise coming, Harry Potter.”And Draco realized as the words finished leaving his mouth that he’djust backed his own father squarely into the corner, more or less withouteven meaning to. Father probably wasn’t going to like this, not the tiniestbit, but now it would be impossible for him to say so… Draco would haveto apologize for that, it had been an honest accident, but it was strange tothink that he’d done it at all.“Then go ahead and defeat the evil General Chaos,” Harry said, stilllooking amused. “I can’t win against both your armies—not if you reallywork together. But I wonder if perhaps I could break you up before then.”“You won’t, and we’ll crush you!” said Draco Malfoy.And beside him, Hermione Granger firmly nodded.“Well,” said Professor Quirrell after the astounded silence hadstretched for a while. “That was not how I expected that particular578 *conversation to go.” The Defense Professor had a rather intrigued expression on his face. “Truthfully, Mr. Potter, I expected you to concedeimmediately and with a smile, then announce that you had long sinceworked out my intended lesson but had decided not to spoil it for others.Indeed, I planned my speech accordingly, Mr. Potter.”Harry Potter just shrugged. “Sorry about that,” he said, and said nothing more.“Oh, don’t worry,” said Professor Quirrell. “This, too, will serve.”And Professor Quirrell turned from the three children, and straightened at the podium to address the whole watching crowd; his customaryair of detached amusement dropped away like a falling mask, and whenhe spoke again his voice was amplified louder than it had been.“If not for Harry Potter,” said Professor Quirrell, his voice as crisp andcold as December, “You-Know-Who would have won.”The silence was instant, and total.“Make no mistake,” said Professor Quirrell. “The Dark Lord was winning.There were fewer and fewer Aurors who dared face him, the vigilanteswho opposed him were being hunted down. One Dark Lord and perhapsfifty Death Eaters were winning against a country of thousands. That isbeyond ridiculous! There are no grades low enough for me to mark thatincompetence!”There was a frown on the face of Headmaster Dumbledore; and onthe faces of the audience, puzzlement; and the utter silence went on.“Do you understand now how it happened? You saw it today. I allowed traitors, and gave the generals no means to restrain them. Yousaw the result. Clever plots and clever betrayals, until the last soldier lefton the battlefield shot himself! You cannot possibly doubt that all three ofthose armies could have been defeated by any outside foe that was unifiedwithin itself.”Professor Quirrell leaned forward at the podium, his voice now filledwith a grim intensity. His right hand stretched out, fingers open and579 *spread. “Division is weakness,” said the Defense Professor. His handclosed into a tight fist. “Unity is strength. The Dark Lord understood thatwell, whatever his other follies; and he used that understanding to createthe one simple invention that made him the most terrible Dark Lord inhistory. Your parents faced one Dark Lord. And fifty Death Eaters whowere perfectly unified, knowing that any breach of their loyalty would bepunished by death, that any slack or incompetence would be punished bypain. None could escape the Dark Lord’s grasp once they took his Mark.And the Death Eaters agreed to take that terrible Mark because they knewthat once they took it, they would be united, facing a divided land. OneDark Lord and fifty Death Eaters would have defeated an entire country,by the power of the Dark Mark.”Professor Quirrell’s voice was bleak and hard. “Your parents couldhave fought back in kind. They did not. There was a man named YermyWibble who called upon the nation to institute a draft, though he did notquite have vision enough to propose a Mark of Britain. Yermy Wibbleknew what would happen to him; he hoped his death would inspire others. So the Dark Lord took his family for good measure. Their emptyskins inspired nothing but fear, and no one dared to speak again. Andyour parents would have faced the consequences of their despicable cowardice, if not for being saved by a one-year-old boy.” Professor Quirrell’sface showed full contempt. “A dramatist would have called that a dei exmachina, for they did nothing to earn their salvation. He-Who-Must-NotBe-Named may not have deserved to win, but make no doubt of it, yourparents deserved to lose.”The voice of the Defense Professor rang forth like iron. “And knowthis: your parents have learned nothing! The nation is still fragmentedand weak! How few decades passed between Grindelwald and You-KnowWho? Do you think you will not see the next threat in your own lifetimes?Will you repeat then the follies of your parents, when you have seen theresults so clearly laid out before you this day? For I can tell you what yourparents will do, when the day of darkness comes! I can tell you what lesson they have learned! They have learned to hide like cowards and donothing while they wait for Harry Potter to save them!”There was a wondering look in the eyes of Headmaster Dumbledore;580 *and other students gazed up at their Defense Professor with bewilderment and anger and awe.Professor Quirrell’s eyes were as cold now as his voice. “Mark this,and mark it well. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named wished to rule over thiscountry, to hold it in his cruel grasp forever. But at least he wished torule over a living country, and not a heap of ash! There have been DarkLords who were mad, who wished only to make the world a vast funeralpyre! There have been wars in which one whole country marched againstanother! Your parents nearly lost against half a hundred, who thought totake this country alive! How quickly would they have been crushed by afoe more numerous than they, a foe that cared for nothing but their destruction? This I foretell: When the next threat rises, Lucius Malfoy willclaim that you must follow him or perish, that your only hope is to trust inhis cruelty and strength. And though Lucius Malfoy himself will believeit, this will be a lie. For when the Dark Lord perished, Lucius Malfoy didnot unite the Death Eaters, they were shattered in an instant, they fledlike whipped dogs and betrayed each other! Lucius Malfoy is not strongenough to be a true Lord, Dark or otherwise.”Draco Malfoy’s fists were clenched white, there were tears in his eyes,and fury, and unbearable shame.“No,” said Professor Quirrell, “I do not think it will be Lucius Malfoywho saves you. And lest you think that I speak on my own behalf, time willmake clear soon enough that this is not so. I make you no recommendation, my students. But I say that if a whole country were to find a leaderas strong as the Dark Lord, but honorable and pure, and take his Mark;then they could crush any Dark Lord like an insect, and all the rest of ourdivided magical world could not threaten them. And if some still greaterenemy rose against us in a war of extermination, then only a united magical world could survive.”There were gasps, mostly from Muggleborns; the students in greentrimmed robes looked merely puzzled. Now it was Harry Potter whosefists were clenched tight and trembling; and Hermione Granger besidehim was angry and dismayed.The Headmaster rose from his seat, his face now stern, saying noword as yet; but the command was clear.“I do not say what threat will come,” said Professor Quirrell. “But youwill not live all your lives in peace, not if the past history of the world isany guide at all to its future. And if you do in the future as you have seenthree armies do this day, if you cannot throw aside your petty bickeringand take the Mark of a single leader, then indeed you might wish that theDark Lord had lived to rule over you, and regret the day that ever HarryPotter was born—”“Enough!” bellowed Albus Dumbledore.There was silence.Professor Quirrell slowly turned his head to gaze at where Albus Dumbledore stood in the fury of his wizardry; their eyes met, and a soundlessstress pressed down like weight upon all the students, as they listened notdaring to move.“You, too, failed this country,” said Professor Quirrell. “And you knowthe peril as well as I.”“Such speeches are not for the ears of students,” said Albus Dumbledore in a dangerously rising voice. “Nor for the mouths of professors!”Dryly, then, Professor Quirrell spoke: “There were many speechesmade for the ears of adults, as the Dark Lord rose. And the adults clappedand cheered, and went home having enjoyed their day’s entertainment.But I will obey you, Headmaster, and make no further speeches if youdo not like them. My lesson is simple. I will go on doing nothing abouttraitors, and we will see what students can do for themselves about that,when they do not wait for professors to save them.”And then Professor Quirrell turned back to his students, and hismouth quirked up in a wry grin that seemed to dissipate the dreadfulpressure like a god blowing to scatter the clouds. “But do please be kindto the traitors up until now,” said Professor Quirrell. “They were justhaving fun.”There was laughter, though it was nervous at first, and then it seemedto build, as Professor Quirrell stood there smiling wryly and some of thetension released itself.582 *Draco’s mind was still whirling through a thousand questions and a dazeof horror, as Professor Quirrell prepared to open the envelopes in whichthe three had inscribed their wishes.It had never before occurred to Draco that moon-traveling Muggleswere a greater threat than the slow decline of wizardry, or that Father hadproven himself too weak to stop them.And even stranger, the obvious implication: Professor Quirrell believed that Harry could. The Defense Professor claimed to have made norecommendation, but he’d mentioned Harry Potter over and over in hisspeech; others would already be thinking the same thing as Draco.It was ridiculous. The boy who had covered a stuffed chair in glitterand called it a throne—The boy who faced down Snape and won, whispered a traitorous voice,that boy could grow into a Lord strong enough to rule, strong enough to save usall—Harry had been raised by Muggles! He was practically a mudbloodhimself, he wouldn’t fight against his adopted family—He knows their arts, their secrets and their methods; he can take all of theMuggles’ science and use it against them, alongside our own power as wizards.But what if he refuses? What if he’s too weak?Then, said that inner voice, it will have to be you, won’t it, Draco Malfoy?And then there was a renewed hush from the crowd, as ProfessorQuirrell opened the first envelope.“Mr. Malfoy,” said Professor Quirrell, “your wish is for… Slytherin towin the House Cup.”There was a puzzled pause from the watching audience.“Yes, Professor,” said Draco in a clear voice, knowing that it was onceagain being amplified. “If you can’t do that, then something else forSlytherin—”“I will not award House points unfairly,” said Professor Quirrell. Hetapped a cheek, looking thoughtful. “Which makes your wish difficultenough to be interesting. Would you like to say anything about why,Mr. Malfoy?”Draco turned from the Defense Professor, gazed out at the crowdfrom against that backdrop of platinum and emeralds. Not all of583 *Slytherin had cheered for Dragon Army, there were anti-Malfoy factionswho had expressed that dissatisfaction by supporting the Boy-WhoLived, or even Granger; and those factions would be encouraged greatlyby what Zabini had done. He needed to remind them that Slytherinmeant Malfoy and Malfoy meant Slytherin—“No,” said Draco. “They’re Slytherins, they’ll understand.”There was some laughter from the audience, especially in Slytherin,even from some students who would have called themselves anti-Malfoya moment earlier.Flattery was a lovely thing.Draco turned back to look at Professor Quirrell again, and was surprised to see an embarrassed look on Granger’s face.“And for Miss Granger…” said Professor Quirrell. There was the soundof a tearing envelope. “Your wish is for… Ravenclaw to win the HouseCup?”There was considerable laughter from the audience, including achuckle from Draco. He hadn’t thought Granger played that game.“Well, um,” said Granger, sounding like she was suddenly stumblingover a memorized speech, “I meant to say, that…” She took a deep breath.“There were soldiers from every House in my army, and I don’t meanto slight any of them. But Houses should still count for something, too.It was sad when students in the same House were hexing each otherjust because they were in different armies. People should be able to relyon whoever’s in their House. That’s why Godric Gryffindor, and SalazarSlytherin, and Rowena Ravenclaw, and Helga Hufflepuff created the fourHouses of Hogwarts in the first place. I’m the General of Sunshine, buteven before that, I’m Hermione Granger of Ravenclaw, and I’m proud tobe part of a House that’s eight hundred years old.”“Well said, Miss Granger!” said Dumbledore’s booming voice.Harry Potter was frowning, and something tickled at the edge ofDraco’s recognition.“An interesting sentiment, Miss Granger,” said Professor Quirrell.“But there are times when it is good for a Slytherin to have friends inRavenclaw, or for a Gryffindor to have friends in Hufflepuff. Surely it584 *would be best if you could rely both on your friends in your House, andalso your friends in your army?”Granger’s eyes flicked briefly toward the watching students andteachers, and she said nothing.Professor Quirrell nodded as though to himself, and then turned backto the podium, and took up and tore open the last envelope. Beside Draco,Harry Potter visibly tensed up as the Defense Professor drew forth theparchment. “And Mr. Potter wishes for—”There was a pause as Professor Quirrell looked at the parchment.Then, without any change of expression on Professor Quirrell’s face,the sheet of parchment burst into flames, and burned with a brief, intensefire that left only drifting black dust sprinkling down from his hand.“Please confine yourself to the possible, Mr. Potter,” said ProfessorQuirrell, sounding very dry indeed.There was a long pause; Harry, standing beside Draco, looked rathershaken.What in Merlin’s name did he ask for?“I do hope,” said Professor Quirrell, “that you prepared another wish,if I could not grant that one.”There was another pause.Harry drew a deep breath. “I didn’t,” he said, “but I already thoughtof another one.” Harry Potter turned to look out at the audience, andhis voice firmed as he spoke. “People fear traitors because of the damagethe traitor does directly, the soldiers they shoot or the secrets they tell.But that’s only part of the danger. What people do because they’re afraidof traitors also costs them. I used that strategy today against Sunshineand Dragon. I didn’t tell my traitors to cause as much direct damage aspossible. I told them to act in the way that would create the most distrustand confusion, and make the generals do the most costly things to try andstop them from doing it again. When there are just a few traitors and awhole country opposing them, it stands to reason that what a few traitorsdo might be less damaging than what a whole country does to stop them,that the cure might be worse than the disease—”“Mr. Potter,” said the Defense Professor, his voice suddenly cutting,“the lesson of history is that you are simply wrong. Your parents’ genera*585 *tion did too little to unify themselves, not too much! This whole countryalmost fell, Mr. Potter, though you were not there to see it. I suggest thatyou ask your dorm-mates in Ravenclaw how many of them have lost family to the Dark Lord. Or if you are wiser, do not ask! Do you have a wish tomake, Mr. Potter?”“If you don’t mind,” said the mild voice of Albus Dumbledore, “Ishould like to hear what the Boy-Who-Lived has to say. He has moreexperience than either of us at stopping wars.”A few people laughed, but not many.Harry Potter’s gaze moved to Dumbledore, and he looked consideringfor a moment. “I’m not saying you’re wrong, Professor Quirrell. In thelast war, people didn’t act together, and a whole country almost fell to afew dozen attackers, and yes, that was pathetic. And if we make the samemistake next time, yes, that’ll be even more pathetic. But you never fightthe same war twice. And the problem is, the enemy is also allowed to besmart. If you’re divided you’re vulnerable in one way; but when you try tounite, then you face other risks, and other costs, and the enemy will tryto take advantage of those, too. You can’t stop thinking at just one levelof the game.”“Simplicity also has a great deal to commend it, Mr. Potter,” said thedry voice of the Defense Professor. “I do hope that you have learned something this day about the dangers of strategies more complicated thanuniting your people and attacking your enemy. And if all this does nottie into your wish somehow, I shall be quite annoyed.”“Yes,” said Harry Potter, “it was pretty difficult coming up with a wishto symbolize the costs of unity. But the problem of acting together isn’tjust for wars, it’s something we have to solve all our lives, every day. Ifeveryone is coordinating using the same rules, and the rules are stupid,then if one person decides to do things differently, they’re breaking therules. But if everyone decides to do things differently, they can. It’s exactly the same problem of everyone needing to act together. But for thefirst person who speaks out, it seems like they’re going against the crowd.And if you thought that the only important thing was that people shouldalways be unified, then you could never change the game, no matter howstupid the rules. So my own wish, to symbolize what happens when peo*586 *ple unite in the wrong direction, is that in Hogwarts we should play Quidditch without the Snitch.”“WHAT?” screamed a hundred voices in the crowd, as Draco’s jawdropped.“The Snitch ruins the whole game,” said Harry Potter. “Everythingthe other players do ends up being irrelevant. It would make overwhelmingly more sense to just buy a clock. It’s one of those incredibly stupidthings you don’t notice just because you grew up with it, that people onlydo because everyone else is doing it—”But by that point Harry Potter’s voice could no longer be heard, because the riot had started.The riot ended around fifteen seconds later, after a gigantic spout of fireblasted out of the highest tower of Hogwarts to the sound of a hundredthunders. Draco hadn’t known Dumbledore could do that.The students sat down again very carefully and quietly.Professor Quirrell was laughing, without pause. “So be it, Mr. Potter. Your will be done.” The Defense Professor paused deliberately. “Ofcourse, I only promised one cunning plot. And that is all that the three ofyou will get.”Draco had been half-expecting the words earlier, but now theystill came as a shock; Draco exchanged rapid glances with Granger,they would have been the obvious allies but their wishes were directlyopposed—“You mean,” said Harry, “we have to all agree on a wish?”“Oh, that would be far too much to ask,” said Professor Quirrell. “Thethree of you have no common enemy, do you?”And for one brief moment, so fast that Draco thought he might haveimagined it, the Defense Professor’s eyes flicked in the direction of Dumbledore.“No,” said Professor Quirrell, “I mean that I shall grant three wishesusing a single plot.”587 *There was a confused silence.“You can’t do that,” Harry said flatly from beside Draco. “Not even Ican do that. Two of those wishes are mutually incompatible. It’s logicallyimpossible—” and then Harry cut himself off.“You’re a few years too young to tell me what I can’t do, Mr. Potter,”said Professor Quirrell, with a brief dry smile.Then the Defense Professor turned back to the watching students.“Truthfully, I have no confidence in your ability to learn this day’s lesson.Go home, and enjoy your time with your families, or what’s left of them,while they still live. My own family is long since dead at the Dark Lord’shand. I shall see you all when classes resume.”In the speechless silence that resulted, Professor Quirrell alreadyturning to walk off the stage, Draco heard the Defense Professor’s voicesay, quietly and no longer amplified, “But you, Mr. Potter, I would speakto now.”588 *hey had gone to the Defense Professor’s office, and Professor Quirrell had sealed the door before he leaned back in his chair and spoke.The Defense Professor’s voice was very calm, and that unnerved Harrya good deal more than if Professor Quirrell had been shouting.“I am trying,” said Professor Quirrell quietly, “to make allowances forthe fact that you are young. That I myself, at the same age, was a quiteextraordinary fool. You speak with adult style and meddle in adult games,and sometimes I forget that you are only a meddler. I hope, Mr. Potter,that your childish meddling has not just killed you, ruined your country,and lost the next war.”It was very hard for Harry to control his breathing. “Professor Quirrell, I said a good deal less than I wished to say, but I had to say something.Your proposals are extremely alarming to anyone who has the slightest familiarity with Muggle history over the last century. The Italian fascists,some very nasty people, got their name from the fasces, a bundle of rodsbound together to symbolize the idea that unity is strength—”“So the nasty Italian fascists believed that unity is stronger than division,” said Professor Quirrell. Sharpness was beginning to creep into hisvoice. “Perhaps they also believed that the sky is blue, and advocated apolicy of not dropping rocks on your head.”Reversed stupidity is not intelligence; the world’s stupidest person may say thesun is shining, but that doesn’t make it dark out… “Fine, you’re right, that wasan ad hominem argument, it’s not wrong because the fascists said it. ButProfessor Quirrell, you can’t have everyone in a country take the Mark589 *of one dictator! It’s a single point of failure! Look, I’ll put it this way.Suppose the enemy just Imperiuses whoever controls the Mark—”“Powerful wizards are not so easy to Imperius,” said Professor Quirrell dryly. “And if you cannot find a worthy leader, you are in any casedoomed. But worthy leaders do exist; the question is whether the peopleshall follow them.”Harry raked his hands through his hair in frustration. He wantedto call a time-out and make Professor Quirrell read The Rise and Fall ofthe Third Reich and then start the conversation over again. “I don’t suppose that if I suggested democracy was a better form of government thandictatorship—”“I see,” said Professor Quirrell. His eyes closed briefly, then opened.“Mr. Potter, the stupidity of Quidditch is transparent to you because youdid not grow up revering the game. If you had never heard of elections,Mr. Potter, and you simply saw what is there, what you saw would notplease you. Look to our elected Minister of Magic. Is he the wisest, thestrongest, the greatest of our nation? No; he is a buffoon who is ownedin fee simple by Lucius Malfoy. Wizards went to the polls and chose between Cornelius Fudge and Tania Leach, who had competed with eachother in a grand and entertaining contest after the Daily Prophet, whichLucius Malfoy also controls, decided that they were the only serious candidates. That Cornelius Fudge was genuinely selected as the best leader ourcountry could offer is not a suggestion anyone could make with a straightface. It is no different in the Muggle world, from what I have heard andseen; the last Muggle newspaper I read mentioned that the previous President of the United States had been a retired movie actor. If you had notgrown up with elections, Mr. Potter, they would be as transparently sillyto you as Quidditch.”Harry sat there with his mouth open, struggling for words. “The pointof elections isn’t to produce the one best leader, it’s to keep politiciansscared enough of the voters that they don’t go completely evil like dictators do—”“The last war, Mr. Potter, was fought between the Dark Lord and Dumbledore. And while Dumbledore was a flawed leader who was losing thewar, it is ridiculous to suggest that any of the Ministers of Magic elected590 *during that period could have taken Dumbledore’s place! Strength flowsfrom powerful wizards and their followers, not from elections and thefools they elect. That is the lesson of magical Britain’s recent history; andI doubt that the next war will teach you a lesson any different. If yousurvive it, Mr. Potter, which you will not do unless you abandon the enthusiastic illusions of childhood!”“If you think there are no dangers in the course of action you advocate,” said Harry, and despite everything his voice was growing sharp,“then that, too, is childish enthusiasm.”Harry stared grimly into Professor Quirrell’s eyes, who stared backwithout blinking.“Such dangers,” said Professor Quirrell coldly, “are to be discussed inoffices like this one, not in speeches. The fools who elected CorneliusFudge are not interested in complications and caution. Present themwith anything more nuanced than a rousing cheer, and you will face yourwar alone. That, Mr. Potter, was your childish error, which Draco Malfoywould not have made even when he was eight years old. It should havebeen obvious even to you that you should have stayed silent, and consultedwith me first, not spoken your worries before the crowd!”“I am no friend of Albus Dumbledore,” said Harry, a cold in his voiceto match Professor Quirrell’s. “But he is no child, and he did not seem tothink my concerns were childish, nor that I should have waited to speakthem.”“Oh,” said Professor Quirrell, “so you take your cues from the Headmaster now, do you?” and stood up from behind his desk.When Blaise turned the corner on the way to the office, he saw that Professor Quirrell was already leaning against the wall.“Blaise Zabini,” said the Defense Professor, straightening; his eyeswere set like dark stones within his face, and his voice sent a shiver offear down Blaise’s spine.He can’t do anything against me, I just have to remember that—“I believe,” said Professor Quirrell, in a clear, cold voice, “that I havealready guessed the name of your employer. But I would hear it from yourown lips, and tell me also the price that bought you.”Blaise knew he was sweating under his robes, and that the moisturewould be already visible on his forehead. “I got a chance to show I wasbetter than all three generals, and I took it. A lot of people hate me now,but there’re also plenty of Slytherins who’ll love me for it. What makesyou think I’m—”“You did not devise the plan of today’s battle, Mr. Zabini. Tell me whodid.”Blaise swallowed hard. “Well… I mean, in that case… then you alreadyknow who did, right? The only one who’s that crazy is Dumbledore. Andhe’ll protect me if you try to do anything.”“Indeed. Tell me the price.” The Defense Professor’s eyes were stillhard.“It’s my cousin Kimberly,” Blaise said, swallowing again and trying tocontrol his voice. “She’s real, and she’s really being bullied, Potter checkedthat, he wasn’t dumb. Only Dumbledore said that he’d nudged the bulliesinto doing it, just for the plan, and if I worked for him she’d be fine afterward, but if I did go with Potter, there was more trouble Kimberly couldget into!”Professor Quirrell was silent for a long moment.“I see,” Professor Quirrell said, his voice now much milder. “Mr. Zabini,should such an event occur again, you may contact me directly. I havemy own ways of protecting my friends. Now, a final question: Even withall the power you took into your hands, forcing a tie would have beendifficult. Did Dumbledore instruct you as to who should win otherwise?”“Sunshine,” said Blaise.Professor Quirrell nodded. “As I thought.” The Defense Professorsighed. “In your future career, Mr. Zabini, I do not suggest trying anyplots that complicated. They have a tendency to fail.”“Um, I said that to the Headmaster, actually,” Blaise said, “and he saidthat was why it was important to have more than one plot going at a time.”Professor Quirrell passed a weary hand across his forehead. “It’s awonder the Dark Lord didn’t go mad from fighting him. You may go on592 *to your meeting with the Headmaster, Mr. Zabini. I will say nothing ofthis, but if the Headmaster should somehow discover that we have spoken, remember my standing offer to give you what protection I can. Youare dismissed.”Blaise didn’t wait for any other word, just turned and fled.Professor Quirrell waited for a time, and then said, “Go ahead, Mr. Potter.”Harry tore the Cloak of Invisibility off his head and stuffed into hispouch. He was trembing with so much rage he could hardly speak. “Hewhat? He did what?”“You should have deduced it yourself, Mr. Potter,” Professor Quirrellsaid mildly. “You must learn to blur your vision until you can see the forest obscured by the trees. Anyone who heard the stories about you, andwho did not know that you were the mysterious Boy-Who-Lived, couldeasily deduce your ownership of an invisibility cloak. Step back fromthese events, blur away their details, and what do we observe? There wasa great rivalry between students, and their competition ended in a perfect tie. That sort of thing only happens in stories, Mr. Potter, and thereis one person in this school who thinks in stories. There was a strangeand complicated plot, which you should have realized was uncharacteristic of the young Slytherin you faced. But there is a person in this schoolwho deals in plots that elaborate, and his name is not Zabini. And I didwarn you that there was a quadruple agent; you knew that Zabini was atleast a triple agent, and you should have guessed a high chance that it washe. No, I will not declare the battle invalid. All three of you failed the test,and lost to your common enemy.”Harry didn’t care about tests at this point. “Dumbledore blackmailedZabini by threatening his cousin? Just to make our battle end in a tie? Why?”Professor Quirrell gave a mirthless laugh. “Perhaps the Headmasterthought the rivalry was good for his pet hero and wished to see it continue. For the greater good, you understand. Or perhaps he was simply593 *mad. You see, Mr. Potter, everyone knows that Dumbledore’s madness isa mask, that he is sane pretending to be insane. They pride themselves onthat clever insight, and knowing the secret explanation, they stop looking.It does not occur to them that it is also possible to have a mask behind themask, to be insane pretending to be sane pretending to be insane. AndI am afraid, Mr. Potter, that I have urgent business elsewhere, and mustdepart; but I should strongly advise you not to take your cues from AlbusDumbledore when fighting a war. Until later, Mr. Potter.”And the Defense Professor inclined his head with some irony, andthen strode off in the same direction Zabini had fled, while Harry wasstill standing in open-mouthed shock.Aftermath: Harry Potter.Harry trudged slowly toward the Ravenclaw dorm, eyes unseeing ofwalls, paintings, or other students; he went up stairs and down rampswithout slowing, speeding, or noticing where he trod.It had taken him more than a minute after Professor Quirrell’s departure to realize that his only source of information about Dumbledore being involved was (a) Blaise Zabini, who he would have to be an absolutegaping idiot to trust again, and (b) Professor Quirrell, who could haveeasily faked a plot in Dumbledore’s style, and who might also think thata little student rivalry was a fine thing; and who had, if you stepped backand blurred out the details, just proposed turning the country into a magical dictatorship.And it was also possible that Dumbledore was the one behind Zabini,and that Professor Quirrell had been sincerely trying to fight the DarkMark in kind, and prevent the repetition of a performance he saw as pathetic. Trying to make sure that Harry didn’t end up fighting the DarkLord alone, while everyone else hid, frightened, trying to stay out of theline of fire, waiting for Harry to save them.But the truth was…594 *Well…Harry was sort of okay with that.It was, he knew, the kind of thing that was supposed to make heroesresentful and bitter.To heck with that. Harry was very much in favor of everyone else staying out of danger while the Boy-Who-Lived took down the Dark Lord byhimself, plus or minus a small number of companions. If the next conflictwith the Dark Lord got to the point of a Second Wizarding War that killedlots of people and embroiled a whole country, that would mean Harry hadalready failed.And if afterward a war broke out between wizards and Muggles, itdidn’t matter who won, Harry would have already failed by letting it getthat far. Besides, who said the societies couldn’t peacefully integratewhen the secrecy inevitably broke down? (Though Harry could hearProfessor Quirrell’s dry voice in his mind, asking him if he was a fool,and saying all the obvious things…) And if mages and Muggles couldn’tlive in peace, then Harry would combine magic and science and figureout how to evacuate all the wizards to Mars or somewhere, instead ofletting a war break out.Because if it did come down to a war of extermination…That was the thing Professor Quirrell hadn’t realized, the one mostimportant question he’d forgotten to ask his young general.The real reason why Harry had no intention of being argued into endorsing a Light Mark, no matter how much it would help him in his fightagainst the Dark Lord.One Dark Lord and fifty Marked followers had been a peril to all ofmagical Britain.If all Britain took the Mark of a strong leader, they would be a peril tothe whole magical world.And if the whole wizarding world took a single Mark, they would be adanger to the rest of humanity.No one knew quite how many wizards there were in the world. He’ddone a few estimates with Hermione and come up with numbers in therough range of a million.But there were six billion Muggles.595 *If it came down to a final war…Professor Quirrell had forgotten to ask Harry which side he wouldprotect.A scientific civilization, reaching outward, looking upward, knowingthat its destiny was to grasp the stars.And a magical civilization, slowly fading as knowledge was lost, stillgoverned by a nobility that saw Muggles as not quite human.It was a terribly sad feeling, but not one that held any hint of doubt.Aftermath: Blaise Zabini.Blaise strolled through the hallways with careful, self-imposed slowness, his heart beating wildly as he tried to calm down—“Ahem,” said a dry, whispering voice from a shadowy alcove as hepassed.Blaise jumped, but he didn’t scream.Slowly, he turned.In that small, shadowy corner was a black cloak so wide and billowingthat it was impossible to determine whether the figure beneath was maleor female, and atop the cloak a broad-brimmed black hat, and a black mistseemed to gather beneath it and obscure the face of whoever or whatevermight lie beneath.“Report,” whispered Mr. Hat and Cloak.“I said just what you told me to,” said Blaise. His voice was a littlecalmer now that he wasn’t lying to anyone. “And Professor Quirrell reacted just the way you expected.”The broad black hat tilted and straightened, as though the head belowhad nodded. “Excellent,” said the unidentifiable whisper. “The reward Ipromised you is already on its way to your mother, by owl.”596 *Blaise hesitated, but his curiosity was eating him alive. “Can I asknow why you want to cause trouble between Professor Quirrell and Dumbledore?” The Headmaster hadn’t had anything to do with the Gryffindor bullies that Blaise knew about, and besides helping Kimberly, theHeadmaster had also offered to make Professor Binns give him excellent marks in History of Magic even if he turned in blank parchmentsfor his homework, though he’d still have to attend class and pretend tohand them in. Actually Blaise would have betrayed all three generals forfree, and never mind his cousin either, but he’d seen no need to say that.The broad black hat cocked to one side, as if to convey a quizzical stare.“Tell me, friend Blaise, did it occur to you that traitors who betray so manytimes over often meet with ill ends?”“Nope,” said Blaise, looking straight into the black mist under the hat.“Everyone knows that nothing really bad ever happens to students in Hogwarts.”Mr. Hat and Cloak gave a whispery chuckle. “Indeed,” said the whisper. “With the murder of one student five decades ago being the exception that proves the rule, since Salazar Slytherin would have keyed hismonster into the ancient wards at a higher level than the Headmasterhimself.”Blaise stared at the black mist, now beginning to feel a little uneasy.But it ought to take a Hogwarts professor to do anything significant tohim without setting off alarms. Quirrell and Snape were the only professors who’d do something like this, and Quirrell wouldn’t care about fooling himself, and Snape wouldn’t hurt one of his own Slytherins… wouldhe?“No, friend Blaise,” whispered the black mist, “I only wished to adviseyou never to try anything like this in your adult life. So many betrayalswould certainly lead to at least one vengeance.”“My mother never got any vengeances,” said Blaise proudly. “Eventhough she married seven husbands and every single one of them diedmysteriously and left her lots of money.”“Really?” said the whisper. “However did she persuade the seventh tomarry her after he heard what happened to the first six?”597 *“I asked Mum that,” said Blaise, “and she said I couldn’t know until Iwas old enough, and I asked her how old was old enough, and she said,older than her.”Again the whispery chuckle. “Well then, friend Blaise, my congratulations on having followed in your mother’s footsteps. Go, and if you saynothing of this, we will not meet again.”Blaise backed uneasily away, feeling an odd reluctance to turn hisback.The hat tilted. “Oh, come now, little Slytherin. If you were truly theequal of Harry Potter or Draco Malfoy, you would have already realizedthat my hinted threats were just to ensure your silence before Albus. HadI intended to harm, I would not have hinted; had I said nothing, then youshould have worried.”Blaise straightened, feeling a little insulted, and nodded to Mr. Hatand Cloak; then turned decisively and strode off toward his meeting withthe Headmaster.He’d been hoping to the very end that someone else would show upand give him a chance to sell out Mr. Hat and Cloak.But then Mum hadn’t betrayed seven different husbands at the sametime. When you looked at it that way, he was still doing better than her.And Blaise Zabini went on walking toward the Headmaster’s office,smiling, content to be a quintuple agent—For a moment the boy stumbled, but then straightened, shaking offthe odd feeling of disorientation.And Blaise Zabini went on walking toward the Headmaster’s office,smiling, content to be a quadruple agent.598 *Aftermath: Hermione Granger.The messenger didn’t approach her until she was alone.Hermione was just leaving the girl’s bathroom where she sometimeshid to think, and a bright shining cat leaped out of nowhere and said,“Miss Granger?”She let out a little shriek before she realized the cat had spoken in Professor McGonagall’s voice.Even so she hadn’t been frightened, only startled; the cat was brightand brilliant and beautiful, glowing with a white silver radiance likemoon-colored sunlight, and she couldn’t imagine being scared.“What are you?” said Hermione.“This is a message from Professor McGonagall,” said the cat, still inthe Professor’s voice. “Can you come to my office, and not speak of thisto anyone?”“I’ll be there right away,” said Hermione, still surprised, and the catleaped and vanished; only it didn’t vanish, it traveled away somehow; orthat was what her mind said, even though her eyes just saw it disappear.By the time Hermione had got to the office of her favorite professor,her mind was all a-whirl with speculations. Was there something wrongwith her Transfiguration scores? But then why would Professor McGonagall say not to tell anyone? It was probably about Harry practicing hispartial Transfiguration…Professor McGonagall’s face looked worried, not stern, as Hermioneseated herself in front of the desk—trying to keep her eyes from goingto the nest of cubbyholes containing Professor McGonagall’s homework,she’d always wondered what sort of work grownups had to do to keep theschool running and whether they could use any help from her…“Miss Granger,” said Professor McGonagall, “let me start by sayingthat I already know about the Headmaster asking you to make thatwish—”“He told you?” blurted Hermione in startlement. The Headmaster hadsaid no one else was supposed to know!Professor McGonagall paused, looked at Hermione, and gave a sadlittle chuckle. “It’s good to see Mr. Potter hasn’t corrupted you too much.599 *Miss Granger, you aren’t supposed to admit anything just because I say Iknow. As it happens, the Headmaster did not tell me, I simply know himtoo well.”Hermione was blushing furiously now.“It’s fine, Miss Granger!” said Professor McGonagall hastily. “You’rea Ravenclaw in your first year, nobody expects you to be a Slytherin.”That really stung.“Fine,” said Hermione with some acerbity, “I’ll go ask Harry Potter forSlytherin lessons, then.”“That wasn’t what I wanted to…” said Professor McGonagall, and hervoice trailed off. “Miss Granger, I’m worried about this because youngRavenclaw girls shouldn’t have to be Slytherins! If the Headmaster asksyou to get involved in something you’re not comfortable with, Miss Granger, it really is all right to say no. And if you’re feeling pressured, pleasetell the Headmaster that you would like me to be there, or that you wouldlike to ask me first.”Hermione’s eyes were very wide. “Does the Headmaster do thingsthat are wrong?”Professor McGonagall looked a little sad at that. “Not on purpose,Miss Granger, but I think… well, it probably is true that sometimes theHeadmaster has trouble remembering what it’s like to be a child. Evenwhen he was a child, I’m sure he must have been brilliant, and strong ofmind and heart, with courage enough for three Gryffindors. Sometimesthe Headmaster asks too much of his young students, Miss Granger, orisn’t careful enough not to hurt them. He is a good man, but sometimeshis plotting can go too far.”“But it’s good for students to be strong and have courage,” said Hermione. “That’s why you suggested Gryffindor for me, wasn’t it?”Professor McGonagall smiled wryly. “Perhaps I was only being selfish,wanting you for my own House. Did the Sorting Hat offer you—no, Ishould not have asked.”“It told me I might go anywhere but Slytherin,” said Hermione. She’dalmost asked why she wasn’t good enough for Slytherin, before she’d managed to stop herself… “So I have courage, Professor!”Professor McGonagall leaned forward over her desk. The worry wasshowing plainer on her face now. “Miss Granger, it’s not about courage,it’s about what’s healthy for young girls! The Headmaster is drawing youinto his plots, Harry Potter is giving you his secrets to keep, and nowyou’re making alliances with Draco Malfoy! And I promised your motherthat you would be safe at Hogwarts!”Hermione just didn’t know what to say to that. But the thought wasoccurring to her that Professor McGonagall might not have been warningher if she’d been a boy in Gryffindor instead of a girl in Ravenclaw andthat was, well… “I’ll try to be good,” she said, “and I won’t let anyone tellme otherwise.”Professor McGonagall pressed her hands over her eyes. When shetook them away, her lined face looked very old. “Yes,” she said in a whisper, “you would have done well in my House. Stay safe, Miss Granger, andbe careful. And if you are ever worried or uncomfortable about anything,please come to me at once. I won’t keep you any longer.”Aftermath, Draco Malfoy:Neither of them really wanted to do anything complicated that Saturday, not after fighting a battle earlier. So Draco was just sitting in anunused classroom and trying to read a book called Thinking Physics. It wasone of the most fascinating things that Draco had ever read in his life, atleast the parts he could understand, at least when the accursed idiot whorefused to let his books out of his sight could manage to shut up and letDraco concentrate—“Hermione Granger is a muuudbloood,” sang Harry Potter from wherehe sat at a nearby desk, reading a far more advanced book of his own.“I know what you’re trying to do,” said Draco calmly without lookingup from the pages. “It’s not going to work. We’re still ganging up andcrushing you.”“A Maaaalfoy is working with a muuudbloood, what will all your father’sfrieeeends think—”“They’ll think Malfoys aren’t as easily manipulated as you seem to believe, Potter!”The Defense Professor was crazier than Dumbledore, no futuresaviour of the world could ever be this childish and undignified at any age.“Hey, Draco, you know what’s really going to suck? You know thatHermione Granger has two copies of the magical allele, just like you andjust like me, but all your classmates in Slytherin don’t know that andyooouuu’re not allowed to explaaaaain—”Draco’s fingers were whitening where they gripped the book. Beingbeaten and spat upon couldn’t possibly require this much self-control,and if he didn’t get back at Harry soon, he was going to do somethingincriminating—“So what did you wish the first time?” said Draco.Harry didn’t say anything, so Draco looked up from his book, and felta twinge of malicious satisfaction at the sad look on Harry’s face.“Um,” Harry said. “A lot of people asked me that, but I don’t thinkProfessor Quirrell would have wanted me to talk about it.”Draco put a serious look on his own face. “You can talk about it withme. It’s probably not important compared to the other secrets you’ve toldme, and what else are friends for?” That’s right, I’m your friend! Feel guilty!“It wasn’t really all that interesting,” Harry said with obviously artificial lightness. “Just, I wish Professor Quirrell would teach Battle Magic againnext year.”Harry sighed, and looked back down at his book.And said, after another few seconds, “Your father’s probably going tobe pretty upset with you this Christmas, but if you promise him that you’llbetray the mudblood girl and wipe out her army, everything will go backto being all right, and you’ll still get your Christmas presents.”Maybe if he and Granger asked Professor Quirrell extra politely andused some of their Quirrell points, the two of them would be allowed to dosomething more interesting to General Chaos than putting him to sleep.602 *renching disorientation, that was how it felt to walk out of Platform Nine and Three-Quarters into the rest of Earth, the worldthat Harry had once thought was the only real world. People dressed in casual shirts and pants, instead of the more dignified robes of wizards andwitches. Scattered bits of trash here and there around the benches. A forgotten smell, the fumes of burned gasoline, raw and sharp in the air. Theambiance of the King’s Cross train station, less bright and cheerful thanHogwarts or Diagon Alley; the people seemed smaller, more afraid, andlikely would have eagerly traded their problems for a dark wizard to fight.Harry wanted to cast Scourgify for the dirt, and Everto for the garbage,and if he’d known the spell, a Bubble-Head Charm so he wouldn’t haveto breathe the air. But he couldn’t use his wand, in this place…This, Harry realized, must be what it felt like to go from a First Worldcountry to a Third World country.Only it was the Zeroth World which Harry had left, the wizardingworld, of Cleansing Charms and house elves; where, between the healer’sarts and your own magic, you could hit one hundred and seventy beforeold age really started catching up with you.And nonmagical London, Muggle Earth, to which Harry had temporarily returned. This was where Mum and Dad would live out the restof their lives, unless technology leapfrogged over wizardry’s quality oflife, or something deeper in the world changed.Without even thinking about it, Harry’s head turned and his eyesdarted behind him to see the wooden trunk that was scurrying afterhim, unnoticed by any Muggles, the clawed tentacles offering quickconfirmation that, yes, he hadn’t just imagined it all…603 *And then there was the other reason for the tight feeling in his chest.His parents didn’t know.They didn’t know anything.They didn’t know…“Harry?” called a thin, blonde woman whose perfectly smooth and unblemished skin made her look a good deal younger than thirty-three; andHarry realized with a start that it was magic, he hadn’t known the signsbefore but he could see them now. And whatever sort of potion lasted thatlong, it must have been terribly dangerous, because most witches didn’tdo that to themselves, they weren’t that desperate…There was water gathering in Harry’s eyes.“Harry?” yelled an older-looking man with a paunch gathering abouthis stomach, dressed with ostentatious academic carelessness in a blackvest thrown over a dark grey-green shirt, someone who would always bea professor anywhere he went, who would certainly have been one of themost brilliant wizards of his generation, if he’d been born with two copiesof that gene, instead of zero…Harry raised his hand and waved to them. He couldn’t speak. Hecouldn’t speak at all.They came over to him, not running, but at a steady, dignified walk;that was how fast Professor Michael Verres-Evans walked, and Mrs. Petunia Evans-Verres wasn’t about to walk any faster.The smile on his father’s face wasn’t very wide, but then his fathernever was given to huge smiles; it was, at least, as wide as Harry had everseen it, wider than when a new grant came in, or when one of his studentsgot a position, and you couldn’t ask for a wider smile than that.Mum was blinking hard, and she was trying to smile but not doing avery good job.“So!” said his father as he came striding up. “Made any revolutionarydiscoveries yet?”Of course Dad thought he was joking.It hadn’t hurt quite so much when his parents didn’t believe in him,back when no one else had believed in him either, back when Harry hadn’tknown how it felt to be taken seriously by people like Headmaster Dumbledore and Professor Quirrell.604 *And that was when Harry realized that the Boy-Who-Lived only existed in magical Britain, that there wasn’t any such person in Muggle London, just a cute little eleven-year-old boy going home for Christmas.“Excuse me,” Harry said, his voice trembling, “I’m going to breakdown and cry now, it doesn’t mean there was anything wrong at school.”Harry started to move forward, and then stopped, torn between hugging his father and hugging his mother, he didn’t want either one to feelslighted or that Harry loved them more than the other—“You,” said his father, “are a very silly boy, Mr. Verres,” and he gentlytook Harry by the shoulders and pushed him into the arms of his mother,who was kneeling down, tears already streaking her cheek.“Hello, Mum,” Harry said with his voice wavering, “I’m back.” And hehugged her, amid the noisy mechanical sounds and the smell of burnedgasoline; and Harry started crying, because he knew that nothing couldgo back, least of all him.The sky was completely dark, and stars were coming out, by the time theynegotiated the Christmas traffic to the university town that was Oxford,and parked in the driveway of the small, dingy-looking old house thattheir family used to keep the rain off their books.As they walked up the brief stretch of pavement leading to the frontdoor, they passed a series of flower-pots holding small, dim electric lights(dim since they had to recharge themselves off solar power during theday), and the lights lit up just as they passed. The hard part had beenfinding motion sensors that were waterproof and triggered at just theright distance…In Hogwarts there were real torches like that.And then the front door opened and Harry stepped into their livingroom, blinking hard.Every inch of wall space is covered by a bookcase. Each bookcase has sixshelves, going almost to the ceiling. Some bookshelves are stacked to the brimwith hardcover books: science, math, history, and everything else. Other shelveshave two layers of paperback science fiction, with the back layer of books propped605 *up on old tissue boxes or two-by-fours, so that you can see the back layer of booksabove the books in front. And it still isn’t enough. Books are overflowing onto thetables and the sofas and making little heaps under the windows…The Verres household was just as he’d left it, only with more books,which was also just how he’d left it.And a Christmas tree, naked and undecorated just two days beforeChristmas Eve, which threw Harry briefly before he realized, with a warmfeeling blossoming in his chest, that of course his parents had waited.“We took the bed out of your room to make room for more bookcases,”said his father. “You can sleep in your trunk, right?”“You can sleep in my trunk,” said Harry.“That reminds me,” said his father. “What did they end up doing aboutyour sleep cycle?”“Magic,” Harry said, making a beeline for the door that opened uponhis bedroom, just in case Dad wasn’t joking…“That’s not an explanation!” said Professor Verres-Evans, just asHarry shouted, “You used up all the open space on my bookcases?”Harry had spent the 23rd of December shopping for Muggle things thathe couldn’t just Transfigure; his father had been busy and had said thatHarry would need to walk or take the bus, which had suited Harry justfine. Some of the people at the hardware store had given Harry questioning looks, but he’d said with an innocent voice that his father was shopping nearby and was very busy and had sent him to get some things (holding up a list in carefully adult-looking half-illegible handwriting); and inthe end, money was money.They had all decorated the Christmas tree together, and Harry had puta tiny dancing fairy on top (two Sickles, five Knuts at Gambol & Japes).Gringotts had readily exchanged Galleons for paper money, but theydidn’t seem to have any simple way to turn larger quantities of gold intotax-free, unsuspicious Muggle money in a numbered Swiss bank account.This had rather spiked Harry’s plan to turn most of the money he’d self*606 *stolen into a sensible mix of 60% international index funds and 40% Berkshire Hathaway. For the moment, Harry had diversified his assets a little further by sneaking out late at night, invisible and Time-Turned, andburying one hundred golden Galleons in the backyard. He’d always always always wanted to do that anyway.Some of December 24th had been spent with the Professor readingHarry’s books and asking questions. Most of the experiments his fatherhad suggested were impractical, at least for the moment; of those remaining, Harry had done many of them already. (“Yes, Dad, I checked whathappened if Hermione was given a changed pronunciation and she didn’tknow whether it was changed, that was the very first experiment I did,Dad!”)The last question Harry’s father had asked, looking up from Magical Draughts and Potions with an expression of bewildered disgust, waswhether it all made sense if you were a wizard; and Harry had answeredno.Whereupon his father had declared that magic was unscientific.Harry was still a little shocked at the idea of pointing to a section ofreality and calling it unscientific. Dad seemed to think that the conflictbetween his intuitions and the universe meant that the universe had aproblem.(Then again, there were lots of physicists who thought that quantummechanics was weird, instead of quantum mechanics being normal andthem being weird.)Harry had shown his mother the healer’s kit he’d bought to keep intheir house, though most of the potions wouldn’t work on Dad. Mumhad stared at the kit in a way that made Harry ask whether Mum’s sister had ever bought anything like that for Grandpa Edwin and GrandmaElaine. And when Mum still hadn’t answered, Harry had said hastily thatshe must have just never thought of it. And then, finally, he’d fled theroom.Lily Evans probably hadn’t thought of it, that was the sad thing. Harryknew that other people had a tendency to not-think about painful subjects, in the same way they had a tendency not to deliberately rest theirhands on red-hot stove burners; and Harry was starting to suspect that607 *most Muggleborns rapidly acquired a tendency to not-think about theirfamily, who were all going to die before they reached their first centuryanyway.Not that Harry had any intention of letting that happen, of course.And then it was late in the day on December 24th and they were driving off for their Christmas Eve dinner.The house was huge, not by Hogwarts standards, but certainly by the standards of what you could get if your father was a distinguished professortrying to live in Oxford. Two stories of brick gleaming in the setting sun,with windows on top of windows and one tall window that went up muchfurther than glass should go, that was going to be one huge living room…Harry took a deep breath, and rang the doorbell.There was a distant call of “Honey, can you get it?”This was followed by a slow patter of approaching steps.And then the door opened to reveal a genial man, of fat and rosycheeks and thinning hair, in a blue button-down shirt straining slightlyat the seams.“Dr. Granger?” Harry’s father said briskly, before Harry could evenspeak. “I’m Michael, and this is Petunia and our son Harry. The food’sin the magical trunk,” and Dad made a vague gesture behind him—notquite in the direction of the trunk, as it happened.“Yes, please, come in,” said Leo Granger. He stepped forward and tookthe wine bottle from the Professor’s outstretched hands, with a muttered“Thank you,” and then stepped back and waved at the living room. “Havea seat. And,” his head turning down to address Harry, “all the toys aredownstairs in the basement, I’m sure Herm will be down shortly, it’s thefirst door on your right,” and pointed toward a hallway.Harry just looked at him for a moment, conscious that he was blocking his parents from coming in.“Toys?” said Harry in a bright, high-pitched voice, with his eyes wide.“I love toys!”There was an intake of breath from his mother behind him, and Harrystrode into the house, managing not to stomp too hard as he walked.The living room was every bit as large as it had looked from outside,with a huge vaulted ceiling dangling a gigantic chandelier, and a Christmas tree that must have been murder to maneuver through the door. Thelower levels of the tree were thoroughly and carefully decorated in neatpatterns of red and green and gold, with a newfound sprinkling of blueand bronze; the heights that only a grownup could reach were carelessly,randomly draped with strings of lights and wreaths of tinsel. A hallwayextended until it terminated in the cabinetry of a kitchen, and woodenstairs with polished metal railings stretched up toward a second floor.“Gosh!” Harry said. “This is a big house! I hope I don’t get lost inhere!”Dr. Roberta Granger was feeling rather nervous as dinner approached.The turkey and the roast, their own contributions to the common project,were steadily cooking away in the oven; the other dishes were to bebrought by their guests, the Verres family, who had adopted a boy namedHarry. Who was known to the wizarding world as the Boy-Who-Lived.And who was also the only boy that Hermione had ever called “cute”, ornoticed at all, really.The Verreses had said that Hermione was the only child in Harry’sage group whose existence their son had ever acknowledged in any waywhatsoever.And it might’ve been jumping the gun just a little; but both coupleshad a sneaking suspicion that wedding bells might be in the offing a fewyears down the road.So while Christmas Day would be spent, as always, with her husband’sfamily, they’d decided to spend Christmas Eve meeting their daughter’spossible future in-laws.The doorbell rang while she was right in the middle of basting theturkey, and she raised her voice and shouted, “Honey, can you get it?”There was a brief groan of a chair and its occupant, and then therewas the sound of her husband’s heavy footsteps and the door swingingopen.“Dr. Granger?” said an older man’s brisk voice. “I’m Michael, and thisis Petunia and our son Harry. The food’s in the magical trunk.”“Yes, please, come in,” said her husband, followed by a muttered“Thank you” that indicated some sort of present had been accepted, and“Have a seat.” Then Leo’s voice altered to a tone of artificial enthusiasm,and said, “And all the toys are downstairs in the basement, I’m sure Hermwill be down shortly, it’s the first door on your right.”There was a brief pause.Then a young boy’s bright voice said, “Toys? I love toys!”There was the sound of footsteps entering the house, and then thesame bright voice said, “Gosh! This is a big house! I hope I don’t get lostin here!”Roberta closed up the oven, smiling. She’d been a bit worried aboutthe way Hermione’s letters had described the Boy-Who-Lived—thoughcertainly her daughter hadn’t said anything indicating that Harry Potterwas dangerous; nothing like the dark hints written in the books Robertahad bought, supposedly for Hermione, during their trip to Diagon Alley.Her daughter hadn’t said much at all, only that Harry talked like he cameout of a book, and Hermione was studying harder than she ever had inher life just to stay ahead of him in class. But from the sound of it, HarryPotter was an ordinary eleven-year-old boy.She got to the front door just as her daughter came clattering frantically down the stairs at a speed that didn’t look safe at all, Hermione hadclaimed that witches were more resistant to falls but Roberta wasn’t quitesure she believed that—Roberta took in her first sight of Professor and Mrs. Verres, who wereboth looking rather nervous, just as the boy with the legendary scar onhis forehead turned to her daughter and said, now in a lower voice, “Wellmet on this fairest of evenings, Miss Granger.” His hand stretched back,as though offering his parents on a silver platter. “I present to you myfather, Professor Michael Verres-Evans, and my mother, Mrs. PetuniaEvans-Verres.”And as Roberta’s mouth was gaping open, the boy turned back to hisparents and said, now in that bright voice again, “Mum, Dad, this is Hermione! She’s really smart!”“Harry!” hissed her daughter. “Stop that!”The boy swiveled again to regard Hermione. “I’m afraid, MissGranger,” the boy said gravely, “that you and I have been exiled to thelabyrinthine recesses of the basement. Let us leave them to their adultconversations, which would no doubt soar far above our own childishintellects, and resume our ongoing discussion of the implications ofHumean projectivism for Transfiguration.”“Excuse us, please,” said her daughter in a very firm tone, and grabbedthe boy by his left sleeve, and dragged him into the hallway—Robertaswiveled helplessly to track them as they went past her, the boy gave hera cheery wave—and then Hermione pulled the boy into the basement access and slammed the door behind her.“I, ah, I apologize for…” said Mrs. Verres in a faltering voice.“I’m sorry,” said the Professor, smiling fondly, “Harry can be a bittouchy about that sort of thing. But I expect he’s right about us not being interested in their conversation.”Is he dangerous? Roberta wanted to ask, but she kept her silence andtried to think of subtler questions. Her husband beside her was chuckling, as if he’d found what they’d just seen funny, rather than frightening.The most terrible Dark Lord in history had tried to kill that boy, andthe burnt husk of his body had been found next to the crib.Her possible future son-in-law.Roberta had been increasingly apprehensive about giving her daughter over to witchcraft—especially after she’d read the books, put the datestogether, and realized that her magical mother had probably been killedat the height of Grindelwald’s terror, not died giving birth to her as herfather had always claimed. But Professor McGonagall had made othervisits after her first trip, to “see how Miss Granger is doing”; and Robertacouldn’t help but think that if Hermione said her parents were beingtroublesome about her witching career, something would be done to fixthem…Roberta put her best smile on her face, and did what she could tospread some pretended Christmas cheer.The dining room table was much longer than six people—er, four people and two children—really needed, but all of it was draped with a tablecloth of fine white linen, and the dishes had been needlessly transferredto fancy serving plates, which at least were of stainless steel rather thanreal silver.Harry was having a bit of trouble concentrating on the turkey.The conversation had turned to Hogwarts, naturally; and it’d been obvious to Harry that his parents were hoping that Hermione would tripup and say more about Harry’s school life than Harry had been tellingthem. And either Hermione had realized this, or she was just automatically steering clear of anything that might prove troublesome.So Harry was fine.But unfortunately Harry had made the mistake of owling his parentswith all sorts of facts about Hermione that she hadn’t told her own parents.Like that she was general of an army in their after-school activities.Hermione’s mother had looked very alarmed, and Harry had quicklyinterrupted and done his best to explain that all the spells were stunners,Professor Quirrell was always watching, and the existence of magicalhealing meant that lots of things were much less dangerous than theysounded, at which point Hermione had kicked him hard under the table.Thankfully Harry’s father, who Harry had to admit was better than himat some things, had announced with firm professorial authority that hehadn’t worried at all, since he couldn’t imagine children being allowed todo it if it was dangerous.That wasn’t why Harry was having trouble enjoying dinner, though.…the problem with feeling sorry for yourself was that it never took anytime at all to find someone else who had it worse.Dr. Leo Granger had asked, at one point, whether that nice teacherwho’d seemed to like Hermione, Professor McGonagall, was awardingher lots of points in school.Hermione had said yes, with an apparently genuine smile.Harry had managed, with some effort, to stop himself from icily pointing out that Professor McGonagall would never show favoritism to anyHogwarts student, and that Hermione was getting lots of points becauseshe’d earned every, single, one.At another point, Leo Granger had offered the table his opinion thatHermione was very smart and could have gone to medical school and become a dentist, if not for the whole witch business.Hermione had smiled again, and a quick glance had prevented Harryfrom suggesting Hermione might also have been an internationally famous scientist, and asking whether that thought would’ve occurred to theGrangers if they’d had a son instead of a daughter, or if it was unacceptableeither way for their offspring to do better than them.But Harry was rapidly reaching his boiling point.And becoming a lot more appreciative of the fact that his own fatherhad always done everything he could to support Harry’s development asa prodigy and always encouraged him to reach higher and never belittleda single one of his accomplishments, even if a child prodigy was still justa child. Was this the sort of household he could have ended up in, if Mumhad married Vernon Dursley?Harry was doing what he could, though.“And she’s really beating you in all your classes except broomstick riding and Transfiguration?” said Professor Michael Verres-Evans.“Yes,” Harry said with forced calm, as he cut himself another bite ofChristmas Eve turkey. “By solid margins, in most of them.” There wereother circumstances under which Harry would have been more reluctantto admit that, which was why he hadn’t gotten around to telling his fatheruntil now.“Hermione has always been quite good in school,” said Dr. Leo Granger in a satisfied tone.“Harry competes at the national level!” said Professor Michael VerresEvans.“Dear!” said Petunia.Hermione was giggling, and that wasn’t making Harry feel any betterabout her situation. It didn’t seem to bother Hermione and that botheredHarry.“I’m not embarrassed to lose to her, Dad,” Harry said. Right at this moment he wasn’t. “Did I mention that she memorized all her schoolbooksbefore the first day of class? And yes, I tested it.”“Is that, ah, usual for her?” Professor Verres-Evans said to theGrangers.“Oh, yes, Hermione’s always memorizing things,” said Dr. RobertaGranger with a cheerful smile. “She knows every recipe in all my cookbooks by heart. I miss her every time I make dinner.”Judging by the look on his father’s face, Dad was feeling at least someof what Harry felt.“Don’t worry, Dad,” Harry said, “she’s getting all the advanced material she can take, now. Her teachers at Hogwarts know she’s smart, unlikeher parents!”His voice had risen on the last three words, and even as all facesturned to stare at him and Hermione kicked him again, Harry knew thathe’d blown it, but it was too much, just way too much.“Of course we know she’s smart,” said Leo Granger, starting to lookoffended at the child who’d had the temerity to raise his voice at theirdinner table.“You don’t have the tiniest idea,” said Harry, the ice now leaking intohis voice. “You think she reads a lot of books and it’s cute, right? Yousee a perfect report card and you think it’s good that she’s doing well inclass. Your daughter is the most talented witch of her generation and thebrightest star of Hogwarts, and someday, Dr. and Dr. Granger, the factthat you were her parents will be the only reason that history remembersyou!”Hermione, who had calmly got up from her seat and walked aroundthe table, chose that moment to grab Harry’s shirt by the shoulder andpull him out of his chair. Harry let himself be pulled, but as Hermionedragged him away, he said, raising his voice even louder, “It is entirelypossible that in a thousand years, the fact that Hermione Granger’s par*ents were dentists will be the only reason anyone remembers dentistry!”Roberta stared at where her daughter had just dragged the Boy-WhoLived out of the room with a patient look upon her young face.“I’m terribly sorry,” said Professor Verres with an amused smile. “Butplease don’t worry, Harry always talks like that. Aren’t they just like amarried couple already?”The frightening thing was that they were.Harry had been expecting a rather severe lecture from Hermione.But after Hermione pulled them into the basement access and closedthe door behind them, she’d turned around——and was smiling, genuinely so far as Harry could tell.“Please don’t, Harry,” she said in a soft voice. “Even though it’s verynice of you. Everything’s fine.”Harry just looked at her. “How can you stand it?” he said. He had tokeep his voice quiet, they didn’t want the parents to hear, but it rose inpitch if not in volume. “How can you stand it?”Hermione shrugged, and said, “Because that’s the way parents shouldbe?”“No,” Harry said, his voice low and intense, “it’s not, my father neverputs me down—well, he does, but never like that—”Hermione held up a single finger, and Harry waited, watching hersearch for words. It took her a while before she said, “Harry… ProfessorMcGonagall and Professor Flitwick like me because I’m the most talentedwitch of my generation and the brightest star of Hogwarts. And Mumand Dad don’t know that, and you’ll never be able to tell them, but theylove me anyway. Which means that everything is just the way it shouldbe, at Hogwarts and at home. And since they’re my parents, Mr. Potter,you don’t get to argue.” She was once again smiling her mysterious smilefrom dinnertime, and looking at Harry very fondly. “Is that clear, Mr. Potter?”Harry nodded tightly.“Good,” said Hermione, and leaned over and kissed him on the cheek.The conversation had only just gotten started again when a distant highpitched yelp floated back to them,“Hey! No kissing!”The two fathers burst out in laughter just as the two mothers rose upfrom their chairs with identical looks of horror and dashed toward thebasement.When the children had been brought back, Hermione was saying inan icy tone that she was never going to kiss Harry ever again, and Harrywas saying in an outraged voice that the Sun would burn down to a colddead cinder before he let her get close enough to try.Which meant that everything was just the way it should be, and theyall sat back down again to finish their Christmas dinner.t was almost midnight.Staying up late was simple enough for Harry. He just hadn’t usedthe Time-Turner. Harry followed a tradition of timing his sleep cycleto make sure he was awake for when Christmas Eve turned into Christmas Day; because while he’d never been young enough to believe in SantaClaus, he’d once been young enough to doubt.It would have been nice if there had been a mysterious figure who entered your house in the night and brought you presents…A chill went down Harry’s spine then.An intimation of something dreadful approaching.A creeping terror.A sense of doom.Harry sat bolt upright in bed.He looked at the window.“Professor Quirrell?” Harry shrieked very quietly.Professor Quirrell made a slight lifting gesture, and Harry’s windowseemed to fold into its frame. At once a cold gust of winter blew into theroom through the gap, along with a scant few flakes of snow from a skyspotted with grey night-clouds, amid the black and stars.“Fear not, Mr. Potter,” said the Defense Professor in a normal voice.“I have Charmed your parents asleep; they shall not wake until I have departed.”“No one’s supposed to know where I am!” said Harry, still keeping theshriek quiet. “Even owls are supposed to deliver my mail to Hogwarts,not here!” Harry had agreed to that willingly; it would be silly if a DeathEater could win the whole war at any time just by owling him a magicallytriggered hand grenade.Professor Quirrell was grinning, from where he stood in the backyardbeyond the window. “Oh, I shouldn’t worry, Mr. Potter. You are well protected against locating Charms, and no blood purist is likely to think ofconsulting a phone book.” His grin grew wider. “And it did take considerable effort to cross the wards that the Headmaster put around thishouse—though of course anyone who knew your address could simplywait outside and attack you the next time you left.”Harry stared at Professor Quirrell for a while. “What are you doinghere?” Harry said finally.The smile left Professor Quirrell’s face. “I’ve come to apologize,Mr. Potter,” the Defense Professor said quietly. “I should not havespoken to you so harshly as I—”“Don’t,” Harry said. He looked down at the blanket that he was clutching around his pajamas. “Just don’t.”“Have I offended you that much?” said Professor Quirrell’s quietvoice.“No,” Harry said. “But you will if you apologize.”“I see,” said Professor Quirrell, and in an instant his voice grew stern.“Then if I am to treat you as an equal, Mr. Potter, I should say that youhave gravely violated the etiquette that holds between friendly Slytherins.If you are not currently playing the game against someone, you must notmeddle in their plans like that, not without asking them before. For you donot know what their true design may be, nor what stakes they may lose.It would mark you as their enemy, Mr. Potter.”“I’m sorry,” Harry said, in just the same quiet tone that Professor Quirrell had used.“Apology accepted,” said Professor Quirrell.“But,” Harry said, still quietly, “you and I really must speak further onpolitics, at some point.”Professor Quirrell sighed. “I know you dislike condescension,Mr. Potter—”That was a bit of an understatement.“But it would be even more condescending,” said Professor Quirrell,“if I were not to state it clearly. You are missing some life experience,Mr. Potter.”“And does everyone who has sufficient life experience agree with you,then?” said Harry calmly.“What good is life experience to someone who plays Quidditch?” saidProfessor Quirrell, and shrugged. “I think you will change your mind intime, after every trust you place has failed you, and you have become cynical.”The Defense Professor said it as though it were the most ordinarystatement in the world, framed against the black and the stars and thecloud-spotted sky, as one or two tiny snowflakes blew past him in the biting winter air.“That reminds me,” said Harry. “Merry Christmas.”“I suppose,” said Professor Quirrell. “After all, if it is not an apology,then it must be a Christmas gift. The very first one I have ever given, infact.”Harry hadn’t even started yet on learning Latin so he could read theexperimental diary of Roger Bacon; and he hardly dared open his mouthto ask.“Put on your winter coat,” said Professor Quirrell, “or take a warmingpotion if you have one; and meet me outside, under the stars. I shall seeif I can maintain it a little longer this time.”It took Harry a moment to process the words, and then he was dashing for the coat closet.Professor Quirrell kept the spell of starlight going for more than anhour, though the Defense Professor’s face grew strained, and he had tosit down after a while. Harry protested only once, and was shushed.They crossed the boundary from Christmas Eve to Christmas Daywithin that timeless void where Earthly rotations meant nothing, theone true everlasting Silent Night.And just as promised, Harry’s parents slept soundly all through it, until Harry was safely back in his room, and the Defense Professor had gone.right the sun, bright the air, bright the students and bright their par-ents, clean the paved ground of Platform 9.75, the winter Sun hanging low in the sky at 9:45am in the morning on January 5th, 1992. Someof the younger students wore scarves and mittens, but most simply woretheir robes; they were wizards, after all.After Harry had moved away from the landing platform, he took offhis scarf and coat, opened a compartment of his trunk, and stowed awayhis winter things.For a long moment, he stood there letting the January air bite at him,just to see what it was like.Harry took out his wizards’ robes, shrugged them on.And finally, Harry drew his wand; and he couldn’t help thinking ofthe parents he’d only just kissed goodbye, of the world whose problemshe was leaving behind…With a strange feeling of guilt for the unavoidable, Harry said, “Thermos.”The warmth flowed through him.And the Boy-Who-Lived was back.Harry yawned and stretched, feeling more lethargic than anythingelse at the conclusion of his vacation. He didn’t feel like reading his textbooks, or even any serious science fiction, this morning; what he neededwas something completely frivolous to occupy his attention…Well, that wouldn’t be hard to come by, if he was willing to part withfour Knuts.Besides, if the Daily Prophet was corrupt and the Quibbler was theonly competing newspaper, there might be some suppressed real newsin there.Harry trudged back over to the same newsstand from last time, wondering if the Quibbler could top the headline he’d seen before.The vendor started to smile as Harry approached, and then the man’sface suddenly changed, as he caught sight of the scar.“Harry Potter?” gasped the vendor.“No, Mr. Durian,” said Harry, eyes dipping briefly to the man’snametag, “just an amazing imitation—”And then Harry’s voice stopped in his throat, as he caught sight of thetop fold of the Quibbler.Sloshed Seer Spills Secrets:Dark Lord To Return,For just an instant, Harry tried to clamp down on his face, before realizing that not being shocked could be just as revealing, in a sense—“Excuse me,” Harry said. His voice sounded a little alarmed, and hedidn’t even know whether that was too revealing, or just what his normalreaction would be if he didn’t know anything. He’d spent too much timearound Slytherins, he was forgetting how to keep secrets from ordinarypeople. Four Knuts hit the counter. “One copy of the Quibbler, please.”“Oh, no worries, Mr. Potter!” said the vendor hastily, waving hishands. “It’s—never mind, just—”A newspaper flew through the air and hit Harry’s fingers, and he unfolded it.Sloshed Seer Spills Secrets:Dark Lord To Return,Wed Draco Malfoy622 *“It’s free,” said the vendor, “for you, I mean—”“No,” Harry said, “I was going to buy one anyway.”The vendor took the coins, and Harry read on.“Gosh,” Harry said half a minute later, “you get a seer smashed onsix slugs of Scotch and she spills all sorts of secret stuff. I mean, who’dhave thought that Sirius Black and Peter Pettigrew were secretly the sameperson?”“Not me,” said the vendor.“They’ve even got a picture of the two of them together, so we knowwho it is that’s secretly the same person.”“Yup,” said the vendor. “Pretty clever disguise, innit?”“And I’m secretly sixty-five years old.”“You don’t look half that,” the vendor said amiably.“And I’m betrothed to Hermione Granger, and Bellatrix Black, andLuna Lovegood, and oh yes, Draco Malfoy too…”“Goin’ ter be one interesting wedding,” said the vendor.Harry looked up from the newspaper, and said in a pleasant voice,“You know, I heard at first that Luna Lovegood was insane, and I wondered if she really was, or if she was just making stuff up and giggling toherself the whole time. Then when I read my second Quibbler headline,I decided that she couldn’t be insane, I mean, it can’t be easy to make thisstuff up, you couldn’t do it by accident. And now do you know what I think?I think she must be mad after all. When ordinary people try to make stuffup, it doesn’t come out like this. Something’s got to go really wrong withthe inside of your head before this is what comes out when you start making stuff up!”The vendor stared at Harry.“Seriously,” said Harry. “Who reads this stuff?”“You,” said the vendor.Harry wandered off to read his newspaper.He didn’t sit at the same nearby table he’d sat down at with Draco, thefirst time he’d prepared to board this train. That seemed like temptinghistory to repeat itself.623 *It wasn’t just that his first week at Hogwarts had been, judging by theQuibbler, fifty-four years long. It was that, in Harry’s humble opinion, hislife did not need any new threads of complexity.So Harry found a small iron chair somewhere else, distant from themain crowd and the occasional muffled cracks of parents Apparating inwith their children, and sat down and read the Quibbler to see if it contained any suppressed news.And besides the obvious craziness (heaven help them all if any of thatwas real) there was a good deal of snide romantic gossip; but nothing thatwould really be all that important if it was true.Harry was just reading about the Ministry’s proposed marriage law,to ban all marriages, when—“Harry Potter,” said a silken voice that sent a shock of adrenaline jolting through Harry’s blood.Harry looked up.“Lucius Malfoy,” Harry said, his voice weary. Next time he was goingto do the smart thing, and wait outside in the Muggle part of King’s Crossuntil 10:55am.Lucius inclined his head courteously, sending his long white hairdrifting over his shoulders. The man was still carrying that same cane,lacquered in black with a silver snake’s head for its handle; and something about his grip silently said this is a weapon of deadly power, not I amfeeble and leaning on this. His face was expressionless.Two men flanked him, their eyes continuously scanning, their wandsalready gripped low in their hands. The two of them moved like a singleorganism with four legs and four arms, the senior Crabbe-and-Goyle, andHarry thought he could guess which was which, but then it didn’t reallymatter. They were merely Lucius’s appendages, as certainly as if they’dbeen the two rightmost toes on his left foot.“I apologize for disturbing you, Mr. Potter,” said the smooth, silkenvoice. “But you have answered none of my owls; and this, I thought, mightbe my only opportunity to meet you.”“I have received none of your owls,” Harry said calmly. “Dumbledoreintercepted them, I presume. But I would not have answered them if624 *I had, except through Draco. For me to deal with you directly, withoutDraco’s knowledge, would trespass on our friendship.”Please go away, please go away…The grey eyes glittered at him. “Is that your pose, then…” said the senior Malfoy. “Well. I shall play along a little. What was your purpose inmaneuvering your good friend, my son, into a public alliance with thatgirl?”“Oh,” Harry said lightly, “that’s obvious, right? Draco’s working withGranger will make him realize that Muggleborns are human after all.Bwa. Ha. Ha.”A thin trace of a smile moved over Lucius’s lips. “Yes, that does soundlike one of Dumbledore’s plans. Which it is not.”“Indeed,” said Harry. “It is part of my game with Draco, and no workof Dumbledore’s, and that is all I will say.”“Let us dispense with games,” said the senior Malfoy, the grey eyessuddenly hardening. “If my suspicions are true, you would hardly doDumbledore’s bidding in any case, Mr. Potter.”There was a slight pause.“So you know,” Harry said, his voice cold. “Tell me. At which point,exactly, did you realize?”“When I read your response to Professor Quirrell’s little speech,” saidthe white-haired man, and chuckled grimly. “I was puzzled, at first, forit seemed not in your own interest; it took me days to understand whoseinterest was being served, and then it all finally became clear. And it isalso obvious that you are weak, in some ways if not others.”“Very clever of you,” said Harry, still cold. “But perhaps you mistakemy interests.”“Perhaps I do.” A hint of steel came into the silken voice. “Indeed, thatis precisely what I fear. You are playing strange games with my son, to apurpose I cannot guess. That is not a friendly act, and you cannot butexpect me to be concerned!”Lucius was leaning upon his cane with both hands now, and boththose hands white, and his bodyguards had suddenly tensed.Some instinct within Harry claimed that it would be a very bad ideato show his fear, to let Lucius see that he could be intimidated. They were625 *in a public train station anyway—“I find it interesting,” Harry said, putting steel into his own voice,“that you think I could benefit from doing Draco harm. But it is irrelevant, Lucius. He is my friend, and I do not betray my friends.”“What?” whispered Lucius. His face showed sheer shock.Then—“Company,” said one of the minions, and Harry thought, from thevoice, that it must be the senior Crabbe.Lucius straightened and turned, then let out a hiss of disapproval.Neville was approaching, looking scared but determined, in tow behind a tall woman who didn’t look scared at all.“Madam Longbottom,” Lucius said icily.“Mr. Malfoy,” returned the woman with equal ice. “Are you being anannoyance to our Harry Potter?”The bark of laughter that came from Lucius seemed strangely bitter.“Oh, I rather think not. Come to protect him from me, have you?” Thewhite-haired head shifted toward Neville. “And this would be Mr. Potter’s loyal lieutenant, the last scion of Longbottom, Neville, self-styled ofChaos. How strangely does the world turn. Sometimes I think it must allbe mad.”Harry had no idea at all what to say to that, and Neville looked confused, and frightened.“I doubt it is the world that is mad,” said Madam Longbottom. Hervoice took on a gloating tone. “You seem in a poor mood, Mr. Malfoy. Didthe speech of our dear Professor Quirrell cost you a few allies?”“It was a clever enough slander of my abilities,” Lucius said coldly,“though only effective upon the fools who believe that I was truly a DeathEater.”“What?” blurted Neville.“I was under the Imperius, young man,” said Lucius, now soundingtired. “The Dark Lord could hardly have begun recruiting among pureblood families without the support of House Malfoy. I demurred, and hesimply made sure of me. His own Death Eaters did not know it until afterward, hence the false Mark I bear; though since I did not truly consent,it does not bind me. Some of the Death Eaters still believe I was foremost626 *among their number, and for the peace of this nation I let them believeit, to keep them controlled. But I was not such a fool as to support that illfated adventurer of my own choice—”“Ignore him,” Madam Longbottom said, the instruction addressed toHarry as well as Neville. “He must spend the rest of his life pretending,for fear of your testimony under Veritaserum.” Said with malicious satisfaction.Lucius turned his back on her dismissively, and faced Harry again.“Will you request this harridan to depart, Mr. Potter?”“I think not,” said Harry in a dry voice. “I prefer to deal with the partof House Malfoy that’s my own age.”There was a long pause, then. The grey eyes searched him.“Of course…” said Lucius slowly. “I do feel the fool now. This wholetime you were just pretending to have no idea what we were talkingabout.”Harry met the gaze, and said nothing.Lucius raised his cane a few centimeters and struck it hard on theground.The world vanished in a pale haze, all sounds went quiet, there wasnothing in the universe but Harry and Lucius Malfoy and the snakeheaded cane.“My son is my heart,” said the senior Malfoy, “the last worthwhilething I have left in this world, and this I say to you in a spirit of friendship: if he were to come to harm, I would give my life over to vengeance.But so long as my son does not come to harm, I wish you the best of luckin your endeavors. And as you have asked nothing more of me, I will asknothing more of you.”Then the pale haze vanished, showing an outraged Madam Longbottom being blocked from moving forward by the senior Crabbe; her wandwas in her hand, now.“How dare you!” she hissed.Lucius’s dark robes swirled around him, and his white hair, as heturned to the senior Goyle. “We return to Malfoy Manor.”There were three pops of Apparition, and they were gone.A silence followed.627 *“Dear heavens,” said Madam Longbottom. “What was that about?”Harry shrugged helplessly. Then he looked at Neville.There was sweat on Neville’s forehead.“Thank you very much, Neville,” said Harry. “Your help was greatlyappreciated, Neville. And now, Neville, I think you should sit down.”“Yes, General,” said Neville, and instead of coming over to one of theother chairs near Harry, he semi-collapsed into a sitting position on thepavement.“You have wrought many changes in my grandson,” said MadamLongbottom. “I approve of some, but not others.”“Send me the list of which is which,” said Harry. “I’ll see what I cando.”Neville groaned, but said nothing.Madam Longbottom gave a chuckle. “I shall, young man, thank you.”Her voice lowered. “Mr. Potter… the speech given by Professor Quirrell issomething our nation has long needed to hear. I cannot say as much ofyour comment on it.”“I will take your opinion under advisement,” Harry said mildly.“I dearly hope that you do,” said Madam Longbottom, and turned backto her grandson. “Do I still need to—”“It’s okay for you to go, Granma,” said Neville. “I’ll be fine on my own,this time.”“Now that I approve of,” she said, and popped and vanished like a soapbubble.The two boys sat quietly for a moment.Neville spoke first, his voice weary. “You’re going to try to fix all thechanges she approves of, right?”“Not all of them,” Harry said innocently. “I just want to make sure I’mnot corrupting you.”Draco looked very worried. His head kept darting around, despite thefact that Draco had insisted on them going down into Harry’s trunk, andusing a true Quieting Charm and not just the sound-blurring barrier.628 *“What did you say to Father?” blurted Draco, the moment the Quieting Charm went up and the sounds of Platform 9 3/4 vanished.“I… look, can you tell me what he said to you, before he dropped youoff?” said Harry.“That I should tell him right away if you seemed to be threateningme,” said Draco. “That I should tell him right away if there was anything Iwas doing that could pose a threat to you! Father thinks you’re dangerous,Harry, whatever you said to him today it scared him! It’s not a good idea toscare Father!”Oh, hell…“What did you talk about?” demanded Draco.Harry leaned back wearily in the small folding chair that sat at thebottom of his trunk’s cavern. “You know, Draco, just as the fundamentalquestion of rationality is ‘What do I think I know and how do I think Iknow it?’, there’s also a cardinal sin, a way of thinking that’s the oppositeof that. Like the ancient Greek philosophers. They had no clue what wasgoing on, so they’d go around saying things like ‘All is water’ or ‘All is fire’,and they never asked themselves, ‘Wait a minute, even if everything iswater, how could I possibly know that?’ They didn’t ask themselves if theyhad evidence which discriminated that possibility from all the other possibilities you could imagine, evidence they’d be very unlikely to encounterif the theory wasn’t true—”“Harry,” Draco said, his voice strained, “What did you talk about withFather?”“I don’t know, actually,” said Harry, “so it’s very important that I notjust make stuff up—”Harry had never heard Draco shriek in horror in quite that high apitch before.629 *histle.

Pffft.Whirr.Professor Flitwick had silently passed Harry a folded parchment during Charms class that Monday, and the note had said that Harry was tovisit the Headmaster at his convenience and in such fashion that no oneelse would notice, especially not Draco Malfoy or Professor Quirrell. Hisone-time password for the gargoyle would be “squeamish ossifrage”. Thishad been accompanied by a remarkably artistic ink drawing of ProfessorFlitwick staring at him sternly, the eyes of which occasionally blinked;and at the bottom of the note, underlined three times, was the phraseAnd so Harry had finished up Transfiguration class, and studied withHermione, and eaten dinner, and spoken with his lieutenants, and finally, when the clock struck nine, turned himself invisible and droppedback to 6pm and wearily trudged off toward the gargoyle, the turning spiral stairs, the wooden door, the room full of little fiddly things, and thesilver-bearded figure of the Headmaster.This time, Dumbledore looked quite serious, the customary smile absent; and he was dressed in pajamas of a darker and more sober purplethan usual.“Thank you for coming, Harry,” said the Headmaster. The old wizard rose from his throne, began to slowly pace through the room and thestrange devices. “First, do you have with you the notes of yesterday’s encounter with Lucius Malfoy?”“Notes?” blurted Harry.“Surely you wrote it down…” said the old wizard, and his voice trailedoff.Harry felt rather embarrassed. Yes, if you’d just fumbled through amysterious conversation full of significant hints you didn’t understand,the bloody obvious thing to do would be to write it all down immediatelyafterward, before the memory faded, so you could try to figure it out later.“All right,” said the Headmaster, “from memory then.”Harry sheepishly recited as best he could, and got almost halfwaythrough before he realized that it wasn’t smart to just go around tellingthe possibly-crazy Headmaster everything, at least not without thinkingabout it first, but then Lucius was definitely a bad guy and Dumbledore’sopponent so it probably was a good idea to tell him, and Harry had alreadystarted talking and it was too late to try and calculate things out now…Harry finished his recollections honestly.Dumbledore’s face had grown more remote as Harry went on, and atthe end there was a look of ancientness about him, a sternness in the air.“Well,” said Dumbledore. “I suggest you take the best of care that theheir of Malfoy does not come to harm, then. And I will do the same.” TheHeadmaster was frowning, his fingers drumming soundlessly throughthe inky black surface of a plate inscribed with the word Leliel. “And Ithink it would be most extremely wise for you to avoid all interaction withLord Malfoy henceforth.”“Did you intercept owls from him to me?” said Harry.The Headmaster gazed at Harry for a long moment, then reluctantlynodded.For some reason Harry wasn’t feeling as outraged as he should havebeen. Maybe it was just that Harry was finding it very easy to sympathizewith the Headmaster’s point of view right now. Even Harry could understand why Dumbledore wouldn’t want him to interact with Lucius Malfoy; it didn’t seem like an evil deed.Not like the Headmaster blackmailing Zabini… for which they hadonly Zabini’s word, and Zabini was wildly untrustworthy, in fact it was632 *hard to see why Zabini wouldn’t just tell the story that got him the mostsympathy from Professor Quirrell…“How about if, instead of protesting, I say that I understand yourpoint of view,” said Harry, “and you go on intercepting my owls, but youtell me who from?”“I have intercepted a great many owls to you, I am afraid,” Dumbledore said soberly. “You are a celebrity, Harry, and you would receivedozens of letters a day, some from far outside this country, did I not turnthem back.”“That,” Harry said, now starting to feel a bit of indignation, “seemslike going a little too far—”“Many of those letters,” the old wizard said quietly, “will be asking youfor things you cannot give. I have not read them, of course, only turnedthem back to their senders undelivered. But I know, for I receive themtoo. And you are too young, Harry, to have your heart broken six timesbefore breakfast each morning.”Harry looked down at his shoes. He should insist on reading the lettersand judging for himself, but… there was a small voice of common senseinside him, and it was screaming very loudly right now.“Thank you,” Harry muttered.“The other reason I asked you here,” said the old wizard, “was that Iwished to consult your unique genius.”“Transfiguration?” said Harry, surprised and flattered.“No, not that unique genius,” said Dumbledore. “Tell me, Harry, whatevil could you accomplish if a Dementor were allowed onto the groundsof Hogwarts?”It developed that Professor Quirrell had asked, or rather demanded, thathis students test their skills against an actual Dementor after they learnedthe words and gestures to the Patronus Charm.“Professor Quirrell is unable to cast the Patronus Charm himself,”said Dumbledore, as he paced slowly through the devices. “Which isnever a good sign. But then, he volunteered that fact to me in the course of633 *demanding that outside instructors be brought in to teach the PatronusCharm to every student who wished to learn; he offered to pay the expense himself, if I would not. This impressed me greatly. But now heinsists on bringing in a Dementor—”“Headmaster,” Harry said quietly, “Professor Quirrell believes verystrongly in live-fire tests under realistic combat conditions. Wanting tobring in an actual Dementor is completely in character for him.”Now the Headmaster was giving Harry a strange look.“In character?” said the old wizard.“I mean,” said Harry, “it’s entirely consistent with the way ProfessorQuirrell usually acts…” Harry trailed off. Why had he put it that way?The Headmaster nodded. “So you have the same sense I do; that itis an excuse. A very reasonable excuse, to be sure; more so than you mayrealize. Often, wizards seemingly unable to cast a Patronus Charm willsucceed in the presence of an actual Dementor, going from not a singleflicker of light to a full corporeal Patronus. Why this should be, no oneknows; but it is so.”Harry frowned. “Then I really don’t see why you’re suspicious—”The Headmaster spread his hands as though in helplessness. “Harry,the Defense Professor has asked me to pass the darkest of all creaturesthrough the gates of Hogwarts. I must be suspicious.” The Headmastersighed. “And yet the Dementor will be guarded, warded, in a mightycage, I will be there myself to watch it at all times—I cannot think ofwhat ill could be done. But perhaps I am merely unable to see it. And so Iam asking you.”Harry stared at the Headmaster with his mouth open. He was soshocked he couldn’t even feel flattered.“Me?” said Harry.“Yes,” said Dumbledore, smiling slightly. “I try my best to anticipatemy foes, to encompass their wicked minds and predict their evil thoughts.But I would never have imagined sharpening a Hufflepuff’s bones intoweapons.”Was Harry ever going to live that down?“Headmaster,” Harry said wearily, “I know it doesn’t sound good, butin all seriousness: I’m not evil, I’m just very creative—”634 *“I did not say that you were evil,” Dumbledore said seriously. “Thereare those who say that to comprehend evil is to become evil; but they aremerely pretending to be wise. Rather it is evil which does not know love,and dares not imagine love, and cannot ever understand love withoutceasing to be evil. And I suspect that you can imagine your way into theminds of Dark Wizards better than I ever could, while still knowing loveyourself. So, Harry.” The Headmaster’s eyes were intent. “If you stood inProfessor Quirrell’s shoes, what misdeeds could you accomplish after youtricked me into allowing a Dementor onto the grounds of Hogwarts?”“Hold on,” said Harry, and in something of a daze trudged over to thechair in front of the Headmaster’s desk, and sat down. It was a large andcomfortable chair this time, not a wooden stool, and Harry could feel himself enveloped as he sank into it.Dumbledore was asking him to outwit Professor Quirrell.Point one: Harry was rather fonder of Professor Quirrell than of Dumbledore.Point two: The hypothesis was that the Defense Professor was planning to do something evil, and in that subjunctive case, Harry ought to behelping the Headmaster prevent it.Point three…“Headmaster,” Harry said, “if Professor Quirrell is up to something,I’m not sure I can outwit him. He’s got a lot more experience than I do.”The old wizard shook his head, somehow managing to appear verysolemn despite his smile. “You underestimate yourself.”That was the first time anyone had ever said that to Harry.“I remember,” the old wizard continued, “a young man in this veryoffice, cold and controlled as he faced down the Head of House Slytherin,blackmailing his own Headmaster to protect his classmates. And I believethat young man is more cunning than Professor Quirrell, more cunningthan Lucius Malfoy, that he will grow to be the equal of Voldemort himself.It is he who I wish to consult.”Harry suppressed the chill that went through him at the name,frowned thoughtfully at the Headmaster.How much does he know…?635 *The Headmaster had seen Harry in the grip of his mysterious darkside, as deep as Harry had ever sunk into it. Harry still remembered whatit had been like to watch, invisibly Time-Turned, as his past self faceddown the older Slytherins; the boy with the scar on his forehead whodidn’t act like the others. Of course the Headmaster would have noticedsomething odd about the boy in his office…And Dumbledore had concluded that his pet hero had cunning tomatch his destined foe, the Dark Lord.Which wasn’t asking for very much, considering that the Dark Lordhad put a clearly visible Dark Mark on all of his servants’ left arms, andthat he’d slaughtered the entire monastery that taught the martial arthe’d wanted to learn.Enough cunning to match Professor Quirrell would be a whole differentorder of problem.But it was also clear that the Headmaster wouldn’t be satisfied untilHarry went all cold and darkish, and came up with some sort of answerthat sounded impressively cunning… which had better not actually get inthe way of Professor Quirrell’s teaching Defense…And of course Harry would go over to his dark side and think it throughfrom that direction, just to be honest, and just in case.“Tell me,” Harry said, “everything about how the Dementor is to bebrought in, and how it is to be guarded.”Dumbledore’s eyebrows rose for a moment, and then the old wizardbegan to speak.The Dementor would be transported to the grounds of Hogwarts byan Auror trio, all three personally known to the Headmaster, and all threeable to cast a corporeal Patronus Charm. They would be met at the edgeof the grounds by Dumbledore, who would pass the Dementor throughthe Hogwarts wards—Harry asked if the pass was permanent or temporary—whether someone could just bring in the same Dementor again the next day.The pass was temporary (replied the Headmaster with an approvingnod), and the explanation went on: The Dementor would be in a cage ofsolid titanium bars, not Transfigured but true-forged; in time a Dementor’s presence would corrode that metal to dust, but not in a single day.636 *Students awaiting their turn would stay well back of the Dementor,behind two corporeal Patronuses maintained by two of the three Aurorsat any given time. Dumbledore would wait by the Dementor’s cage withhis Patronus. A single student would approach the Dementor; and Dumbledore would dispel his Patronus; and the student would attempt to casttheir own Patronus Charm; and if they failed, Dumbledore would restorehis Patronus before the student could suffer any permanent damage.Past dueling champion Professor Flitwick would also be present whilethere were students near, just to add safety margin.“Why just you waiting by the Dementor?” said Harry. “I mean,shouldn’t it be you plus an Auror—”The Headmaster shook his head. “They could not withstand the repeated exposure to the Dementor, each time I dispel my Patronus.”And if Dumbledore’s Patronus did fail for some reason, while one ofthe students was still near the Dementor, the third Auror would cast another corporeal Patronus and send it to shield the student…Harry poked and prodded, but he couldn’t see a flaw in the security.So Harry took a deep breath, sank further into the chair, closed hiseyes, and remembered:“And that will be… five points? No, let us make it an even ten points fromRavenclaw for backchat.”The cold came more slowly now, more reluctantly, Harry hadn’t beencalling much on his dark side lately…Harry had to run through that entire session in Potions in his mind,before his blood chilled into something approaching deadly crystallineclarity.And then he thought of the Dementor.And it was obvious.“The Dementor is a distraction,” Harry said. The coldness clear in hisvoice, since that was what Dumbledore wanted and expected. “A large,salient threat, but in the end straightforward, and easy to defend against.So while all your attention is focused on the Dementor, the real plot willbe happening elsewhere.”Dumbledore stared at Harry for a moment, and then gave a slow nod.“Yes…” said the Headmaster. “And I do believe I know what it might be a637 *distraction from, if Professor Quirrell means ill… thank you, Harry.”The Headmaster was still staring at Harry, a strange look in those ancient eyes.“What?” said Harry with a tinge of annoyance, the cold still lingeringin his blood.“I have another question for that young man,” said the Headmaster.“It is something I have long wondered to myself, yet been unable to comprehend. Why?” There was a tinge of pain in his voice. “Why would anyone deliberately make himself a monster? Why do evil for the sake of evil?Why Voldemort?”Whirr, bzzzt, tick; ding, puff, splat…Harry stared at the Headmaster in surprise.“How would I know?” said Harry. “Am I supposed to magically understand the Dark Lord because I’m the hero, or something?”“Yes!” said Dumbledore. “My own great foe was Grindelwald, and himI understood very well indeed. Grindelwald was my dark mirror, the manI could so easily have been, had I given in to the temptation to believe thatI was a good person, and therefore always in the right. For the greater good,that was his slogan; and he truly believed it himself, even as he tore atall Europe like a wounded animal. And him, I defeated in the end. Butthen after him came Voldemort, to destroy everything I had protected inBritain.” The hurt was plain now in Dumbledore’s voice, exposed uponhis face. “He committed acts worse by far than Grindelwald’s worst, horror for the sake of horror. I sacrificed everything only to hold him back,and I still don’t understand why! Why, Harry? Why did he do it? He wasnever my destined foe, but yours, so if you have any guesses at all, Harry,please tell me! Why?”Harry stared down at his hands. The truth was that Harry hadn’t readup on the Dark Lord yet, and right now he hadn’t the tiniest clue. Andsomehow that didn’t seem like an answer the Headmaster wanted to hear.“Too many Dark rituals, maybe? In the beginning he thought he’d do just638 *one, but it sacrificed part of his good side, and that made him less reluctant to perform other Dark rituals, so he did more and more rituals ina positive feedback cycle until he ended up as a tremendously powerfulmonster—”“No!” Now the Headmaster’s voice was agonized. “I can’t believe that,Harry! There has to be something more to it than just that!”Why should there be? thought Harry, but he didn’t say it, because itwas clear that the Headmaster thought the universe was a story andhad a plot, and that huge tragedies weren’t allowed to happen exceptfor equally huge, significant reasons. “I’m sorry, Headmaster. The DarkLord doesn’t seem like much of a dark mirror to me, not at all. There isn’tanything I find even the tiniest bit tempting about nailing the skins ofYermy Wibble’s family to a newsroom wall.”“Have you no wisdom to share?” said Dumbledore. There was pleading in the old wizard’s voice, almost begging.Evil happens, thought Harry, it doesn’t mean anything or teach us anything,except to not be evil? The Dark Lord was probably just a selfish bastard who didn’tcare who he hurt, or an idiot who made stupidly avoidable mistakes that snowballed. There is no destiny behind the ills of this world; if Hitler had been allowedinto architecture school like he wanted, the whole history of Europe would havebeen different; if we lived in the sort of universe where horrible things were onlyallowed to happen for good reasons, they just wouldn’t happen in the first place.And none of that, obviously, was what the Headmaster wanted tohear.The old wizard was still looking at Harry from over a fiddly thing likea frozen puff of smoke, a painful desperation in those ancient, waitingeyes.Well, sounding wise wasn’t difficult. It was a lot easier than beingintelligent, actually, since you didn’t have to say anything surprisingor come up with any new insights. You just let your brain’s patternmatching software complete the cliche, using whatever Deep Wisdomyou’d stored previously.“Headmaster,” Harry said solemnly, “I would rather not define myselfby my enemies.”639 *Somehow, even in the midst of all the whirring and ticking, there wasa kind of silence.That had come out a bit more Deeply Wise than Harry had intended.“You may be very wise, Harry…” the Headmaster said slowly. “I dowish… that I could have been defined by my friends.” The pain in his voicehad grown deeper.Harry’s mind searched hastily for something else Deeply Wise to saythat would soften the unintended force of the blow—“Or perhaps,” Harry said more softly, “it is the foe that makes the Gryffindor, as it is the friend that makes the Hufflepuff, and the ambition thatmakes the Slytherin. I do know that it is always, in every generation, thepuzzle that makes the scientist.”“It is a dreadful fate to which you condemn my House, Harry,” said theHeadmaster. The pain was still in his voice. “For now that you remark onit, I do think that I was very much made by my enemies.”Harry stared at his own hands, where they lay in his lap. Maybe heshould just shut up while he was ahead.“But you have answered my question,” said Dumbledore more softly,as though to himself. “I should have realized that would be a Slytherin’skey. For his ambition, all for the sake of his ambition; and that I know,though not why…” For a time Dumbledore stared off into nothingness;then he straightened, and his eyes seemed to focus on Harry again.“And you, Harry,” said the Headmaster, “you name yourself a scientist?” His voice was laced with surprise and mild disapproval.“You don’t like science?” said Harry a little wearily. He’d hoped Dumbledore would be fonder of Muggle things.“I suppose it is useful to those without wands,” said Dumbledore,frowning. “But it seems a strange thing by which to define yourself. Isscience as important as love? As kindness? As friendship? Is it sciencethat makes you fond of Minerva McGonagall? Is it science that makesyou care for Hermione Granger? Will it be science to which you turn,when you try to kindle warmth in Draco Malfoy’s heart?”You know, the sad thing is, you probably think you just uttered some kind ofincredibly wise knockdown argument.640 *Now, how to phrase the rejoinder in such fashion that it also soundedincredibly wise…“You are not Ravenclaw,” Harry said with calm dignity, “and so itmight not have occurred to you that to respect the truth, and seek it allthe days of your life, could also be an act of grace.”The Headmaster’s eyebrows rose up. And then he sighed. “How didyou become so wise, so young…?” The old wizard sounded sad, as he saidit. “Perhaps it will prove valuable to you.”Only for impressing ancient wizards who are overly impressed with themselves, thought Harry. He was actually a bit disappointed by Dumbledore’scredulity; it wasn’t that Harry had lied, but Dumbledore seemed far tooimpressed with Harry’s ability to phrase things so that they sounded profound, instead of putting them into plain English like Richard Feynmanhad done with his wisdom…“Love is more important than wisdom,” said Harry, just to test the limits of Dumbledore’s tolerance for blindingly obvious cliches completed bysheer pattern matching without any sort of detailed analysis.The Headmaster nodded gravely, and said, “Indeed.”Harry stood up out of the chair, and stretched his arms. Well, I’d bettergo off and love something, then, that’s bound to help me defeat the Dark Lord. Andnext time you ask me for advice, I’ll just give you a hug—“This day you have helped me much, Harry,” said the Headmaster.“And so there is one last thing I would ask that young man.”Great.“Tell me, Harry,” said the Headmaster (and now his voice soundedsimply puzzled, though there was still a hint of pain in his eyes), “why doDark Wizards fear death so greatly?”“Er,” said Harry, “sorry, I’ve got to back the Dark Wizards on that one.”Whoosh, hiss, chime; glorp, pop, bubble—“What?” said Dumbledore.“Death is bad,” said Harry, discarding wisdom for the sake of clearcommunication. “Very bad. Extremely bad. Being scared of death islike being scared of a great big monster with poisonous fangs. It actually makes a great deal of sense, and does not, in fact, indicate that youhave a psychological problem.”The Headmaster was staring at him as though he’d just turned into acat.“Okay,” said Harry, “let me put it this way. Do you want to die?Because if so, there’s this Muggle thing called a suicide preventionhotline—”“When it is time,” the old wizard said quietly. “Not before. I wouldnever seek to hasten the day, nor seek to refuse it when it comes.”Harry was frowning sternly. “That doesn’t sound like you have a verystrong will to live, Headmaster!”“Harry…” The old wizard’s voice was starting to sound a little helpless;and he had paced to a spot where his silver beard, unnoticed, had driftedinto a crystalline glass goldfish bowl, and was slowly taking on a greenishtinge that crept up the hairs. “I think I may have not made myself clear.Dark Wizards are not eager to live. They fear death. They do not reach uptoward the sun’s light, but flee the coming of night into infinitely darkercaverns of their own making, without moon or stars. It is not life theydesire, but immortality; and they are so driven to grasp at it that they willsacrifice their very souls! Do you want to live forever, Harry?”“Yes, and so do you,” said Harry. “I want to live one more day. Tomorrow I will still want to live one more day. Therefore I want to liveforever, proof by induction on the positive integers. If you don’t want todie, it means you want to live forever. If you don’t want to live forever, itmeans you want to die. You’ve got to do one or the other… I’m not gettingthrough here, am I.”The two cultures stared at each other across a vast gap of incommensurability.“I have lived a hundred and ten years,” the old wizard said quietly (taking his beard out of the bowl, and jiggling it to shake out the color). “Ihave seen and done a great many things, too many of which I wish I hadnever seen or done. And yet I do not regret being alive, for watching my642 *students grow is a joy that has not begun to wear on me. But I would notwish to live so long that it does! What would you do with eternity, Harry?”Harry took a deep breath. “Meet all the interesting people in theworld, read all the good books and then write something even better,celebrate my first grandchild’s tenth birthday party on the Moon, celebrate my first great-great-great grandchild’s hundredth birthday partyaround the Rings of Saturn, learn the deepest and final rules of Nature,understand the nature of consciousness, find out why anything exists inthe first place, visit other stars, discover aliens, create aliens, rendezvouswith everyone for a party on the other side of the Milky Way once we’veexplored the whole thing, meet up with everyone else who was born onOld Earth to watch the Sun finally go out, and I used to worry aboutfinding a way to escape this universe before it ran out of negentropybut I’m a lot more hopeful now that I’ve discovered the so-called laws ofphysics are just optional guidelines.”“I did not understand much of that,” said Dumbledore. “But I mustask if these are things that you truly desire so desperately, or if you onlyimagine them so as to imagine not being tired, as you run and run fromdeath.”“Life is not a finite list of things that you check off before you’re allowed to die,” Harry said firmly. “It’s life, you just go on living it. If I’mnot doing those things it’ll be because I’ve found something better.”Dumbledore sighed. His fingers drummed on a clock; as they touchedit, the numerals changed to an indecipherable script, and the handsbriefly appeared in different positions. “In the unlikely event that I ampermitted to tarry until a hundred and fifty,” said the old wizard, “I donot think I would mind. But two hundred years would be entirely toomuch of a good thing.”“Yes, well,” Harry said, his voice a little dry as he thought of his Mumand Dad and their allotted span if Harry didn’t do something about it,“I suspect, Headmaster, that if you came from a culture where peoplewere accustomed to living four hundred years, that dying at two hundredwould seem just as tragically premature as dying at, say, eighty.” Harry’svoice went hard, on that last word.“Perhaps,” the old wizard said peacefully. “I would not wish to die643 *before my friends, nor live on after they had all gone. The hardest time iswhen those you loved the most have gone on before you, and yet othersstill live, for whose sake you must stay…” Dumbledore’s eyes were fixedon Harry, and growing sad. “Do not mourn me too greatly, Harry, whenmy time comes; I will be with those I have long missed, on our next greatadventure.”“Oh!” Harry said in sudden realization. “You believe in an afterlife. Igot the impression wizards didn’t have religion?”Toot. Beep. Thud.“How can you not believe it?” said the Headmaster, looking completelyflabbergasted. “Harry, you’re a wizard! You’ve seen ghosts!”“Ghosts,” Harry said, his voice flat. “You mean those things like portraits, stored memories and behaviors with no awareness or life, accidentally impressed into the surrounding material by the burst of magic thataccompanies the violent death of a wizard—”“I’ve heard that theory,” said the Headmaster, his voice growing sharp,“repeated by wizards who mistake cynicism for wisdom, who think thatto look down upon others is to elevate themselves. It is one of the silliestideas I have heard in a hundred and ten years! Yes, ghosts do not learnor grow, because this is not where they belong! Souls are meant to move on,there is no life remaining for them here! And if not ghosts, then what ofthe Veil? What of the Resurrection Stone?”“All right,” Harry said, trying to keep his voice calm, “I’ll hear out yourevidence, because that’s what a scientist does. But first, Headmaster, let metell you a little story.” Harry’s voice was trembling. “You know, when Igot here, when I got off the train from King’s Cross, I don’t mean yesterday but back in September, when I got off the train then, Headmaster,I’d never seen a ghost. I wasn’t expecting ghosts. So when I saw them,Headmaster, I did something really dumb. I jumped to conclusions. I, Ithought there was an afterlife, I thought no one had ever really died, I644 *thought that everyone the human species had ever lost was really fine after all, I thought that wizards could talk to people who’d passed on, thatit just took the right spell to summon them, that wizards could do that, Ithought I could meet my parents who died for me, and tell them that I’dheard about their sacrifice and that I’d begun to call them my mother andfather—”“Harry,” whispered Dumbledore. Water glittered in the old wizard’seyes. He took a step closer across the office—“And then,” spat Harry, the fury coming fully into his voice, the coldrage at the universe for being like that and at himself for being so stupid,“I asked Hermione and she said that they were just afterimages, burnedinto the stone of the castle by the death of a wizard, like the silhouettesleft on the walls of Hiroshima. And I should have known! I should haveknown without even having to ask! I shouldn’t have believed it even for allof thirty seconds! Because if people had souls there wouldn’t be any suchthing as brain damage, if your soul could go on speaking after your wholebrain was gone, how could damage to the left cerebral hemisphere takeaway your ability to talk? And Professor McGonagall, when she told meabout how my parents had died, she didn’t act like they’d just gone awayon a long trip to another country, like they’d emigrated to Australia backin the days of sailing ships, which is the way people would act if they actually knew that death was just going somewhere else, if they had hard evidence for an afterlife, instead of making stuff up to console themselves,it would change everything, it wouldn’t matter that everyone had lost someone in the war, it would be a little sad but not horrible! And I’d already seenthat people in the wizarding world didn’t act like that! So I should haveknown better! And that was when I knew that my parents were reallydead and gone forever and ever, that there wasn’t anything left of them,that I’d never get a chance to meet them and, and, and the other childrenthought I was crying because I was scared of ghosts—”The old wizard’s face was horrified, he opened his mouth to speak—“So tell me, Headmaster! Tell me about the evidence! But don’t youdare exaggerate a single tiny bit of it, because if you give me false hopeagain, and I find out later that you lied or stretched things just a little, Iwon’t ever forgive you for it! What’s the Veil?”645 *Harry reached up and wiped at his cheeks, while the glass things ofthe office stopped vibrating from his last shriek.“The Veil,” said the old wizard with only a slight tremble in his voice,“is a great stone archway, kept in the Department of Mysteries; a gatewayto the land of the dead.”“And how does anyone know that?” said Harry. “Don’t tell me whatyou believe, tell me what you’ve seen!”The physical manifestation of the barrier between worlds was a greatstone archway, old and tall and coming to a sharp point, with a tatteredblack veil like the surface of a pool of water, stretched between the stones;rippling, always, from the constant and one-way passage of the souls. Ifyou stood by the Veil you could hear the voices of the dead calling, alwayscalling in whispers barely on the wrong side of comprehension, growinglouder and more numerous if you stayed and tried to hear, as they tried tocommunicate; and if you listened too long, you would go to meet them,and in the moment you touched the Veil you would be sucked through,and never be heard from again.“That doesn’t even sound like an interesting fraud,” Harry said, hisvoice calmer now that there was nothing there to make him hope, or makehim angry for having hopes dashed. “Someone built a stone archway,made a little black rippling surface between it that Vanished anything ittouched, and enchanted it to whisper to people and hypnotize them.”“Harry…” the Headmaster said, starting to look rather worried. “I cantell you the truth, but if you refuse to hear it…”Also not interesting. “What’s the Resurrection Stone?”“I would not tell you,” the Headmaster said slowly, “save that I fearwhat this disbelief may do to you… so listen, then, Harry, please listen…”The Resurrection Stone was one of the three legendary Deathly Hallows, kin to Harry’s cloak. The Resurrection Stone could call souls backfrom the dead—bring them back into the world of the living, though notas they were. Cadmus Peverell used the stone to call back his lost belovedfrom the dead, but her heart stayed with the dead, and not in the worldof the living. And in time it drove him mad, and he killed himself to betruly with her once more…In all politeness, Harry raised his hand.646 *“Yes?” the Headmaster said reluctantly.“The obvious test to see if the Resurrection Stone is really calling backthe dead, or just projecting an image from the user’s mind, is to ask aquestion whose answer you don’t know, but the dead person would, andthat can be definitely verified in this world. For example, call back—”Then Harry paused, because this time he’d managed to think itthrough one step ahead of his tongue, fast enough to not say the firstname and test that had sprung to mind.“…your dead wife, and ask her where she left her lost earring, or something like that,” Harry finished. “Did anyone do any tests like that?”“The Resurrection Stone has been lost for centuries, Harry,” the Headmaster said quietly.Harry shrugged. “Well, I’m a scientist, and I’m always willing to beconvinced. If you really believe the Resurrection Stone calls back thedead—then you must believe a test like that will succeed, right? So doyou know anything about where to find the Resurrection Stone? I gotone Deathly Hallow already under highly mysterious circumstances, and,well, we both know how the rhythm of the world works on that sort ofthing.”Dumbledore stared at Harry.Harry gazed equably back at the Headmaster.The old wizard passed a hand across his forehead and muttered, “Thisis madness.”(Somehow, Harry managed to stop himself from laughing.)And Dumbledore told Harry to draw forth the Cloak of Invisibilityfrom his pouch; at the Headmaster’s direction, Harry stared at the inside and back of the hood until he saw it, faintly drawn against the silverymesh in faded scarlet like dried blood, the symbol of the Deathly Hallows:a triangle, with a circle drawn inside, and a line dividing them both.“Thank you,” Harry said politely. “I shall be sure to keep an eye out fora stone so marked. Do you have any other evidence?”Dumbledore appeared to be fighting a struggle within himself.“Harry,” the old wizard said, his voice rising, “this is a dangerous roadyou are walking, I am not sure I do the right thing by saying this, but I647 *must wrench you from this way! Harry, how could Voldemort have survivedthe death of his body if he did not have a soul?”And that was when Harry realized that there was exactly one personwho’d originally told Professor McGonagall that the Dark Lord was stillalive in the first place; and it was the crazy Headmaster of their madhouseof a school, who thought the world ran on cliches.“Good question,” Harry said, after some internal debate about howto proceed. “Maybe he found some way of duplicating the power of theResurrection Stone, only he loaded it in advance with a complete copy ofhis brain state. Or something like that.” Harry was suddenly far fromsure that he was trying to come up with an explanation for somethingthat had actually happened. “Actually, can you just go ahead and tell meeverything you know about how the Dark Lord survived and what it mighttake to kill him?” If he even still exists as more than Quibbler headlines.“You are not fooling me, Harry,” said the old wizard; his face lookedancient now, and lined by more than years. “I know why you are trulyasking that question. No, I do not read your mind, I do not have to, yourhesitation gives you away! You seek the secret of the Dark Lord’s immortality in order to use it for yourself!”“Wrong! I want the secret of the Dark Lord’s immortality in order touse it for everyone!”Tick, crackle, fzzzt…Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore just stood there and staredat Harry with his mouth gaping open dumbly.(Harry awarded himself a tally mark for Monday, since he’d managedto blow someone’s mind completely before the day was over.)“And in case it wasn’t clear,” said Harry, “by everyone I mean all Muggles too, not just all wizards.”“No,” said the old wizard, shaking his head. His voice rose. “No, no,no! This is insanity!”“Bwa ha ha!” said Harry.648 *The old wizard’s face was tight with anger and worry. “Voldemortstole the book from which he gleaned his secret; it was not there when Iwent to look for it. But this much I know, and this much I will tell you: hisimmortality was born of a ritual terrible and Dark, blacker than pitchestblack! And it was Myrtle, poor sweet Myrtle, who died for it; his immortality took sacrifice, it took murder—”“Well obviously I’m not going to popularize a method of immortalitythat requires killing people! That would defeat the entire point!”There was a startled pause.Slowly the old wizard’s face relaxed out of its anger, though the worrywas still there. “You would use no ritual requiring human sacrifice.”“I don’t know what you take me for, Headmaster,” Harry said coldly, hisown anger rising, “but let’s not forget that I’m the one who wants peopleto live! The one who wants to save everyone! You’re the one who thinksdeath is awesome and everyone ought to die!”“I am at a loss, Harry,” said the old wizard. His feet once more begantrudging across his strange office. “I know not what to say.” He pickedup a crystal ball that seemed to hold a hand in flames, looked into it witha sad expression. “Only that I am greatly misunderstood by you… I don’twant everyone to die, Harry!”“You just don’t want anyone to be immortal,” Harry said with considerable irony. It seemed that elementary logical tautologies like All x:Die(x) = Not Exist x: Not Die(x) were beyond the reasoning abilities of theworld’s most powerful wizard.The old wizard nodded. “I am less afraid than I was, but still greatlyworried for you, Harry,” he said quietly. His hand, a little wizened by time,but still strong, placed the crystal ball firmly back into its stand. “For thefear of death is a bitter thing, an illness of the soul by which people aretwisted and warped. Voldemort is not the only Dark Wizard to go downthat bleak road, though I fear he has taken it further than any before him.”“And you think you’re not afraid of death?” Harry said, not even tryingto mask the incredulity in his voice.The old wizard’s face was peaceful. “I am not perfect, Harry, but Ithink I have accepted my death as part of myself.”649 *“Uh huh,” Harry said. “See, there’s this little thing called cognitive dissonance, or in plainer English, sour grapes. If people were hit on the headswith truncheons once a month, and no one could do anything about it,pretty soon there’d be all sorts of philosophers, pretending to be wise as youput it, who found all sorts of amazing benefits to being hit on the head witha truncheon once a month. Like, it makes you tougher, or it makes youhappier on the days when you’re not getting hit with a truncheon. But ifyou went up to someone who wasn’t getting hit, and you asked them ifthey wanted to start, in exchange for those amazing benefits, they’d say no.And if you didn’t have to die, if you came from somewhere that no one hadever even heard of death, and I suggested to you that it would be an amazing wonderful great idea for people to get wrinkled and old and eventuallycease to exist, why, you’d have me hauled right off to a lunatic asylum!So why would anyone possibly think any thought so silly as that death isa good thing? Because you’re afraid of it, because you don’t really want todie, and that thought hurts so much inside you that you have to rationalize it away, do something to numb the pain, so you won’t have to thinkabout it—”“No, Harry,” the old wizard said. His face was gentle, his hand trailedthrough a lighted pool of water that made small musical chimes as hisfingers stirred it. “Though I can understand how you must think so.”“Do you want to understand the Dark Wizard?” Harry said, his voicenow hard and grim. “Then look within the part of yourself that flees notfrom death but from the fear of death, that finds that fear so unbearablethat it will embrace Death as a friend and cozen up to it, try to becomeone with the night so that it can think itself master of the abyss. Youhave taken the most terrible of all evils and called it good! With only aslight twist that same part of yourself would murder innocents, and callit friendship. If you can call death better than life then you can twist yourmoral compass to point anywhere—”“I think,” said Dumbledore, shaking water droplets from his hand tothe sound of tiny tinkling bells, “that you understand Dark Wizards verywell, without yet being one yourself.” It was said in perfect seriousness,and without accusation. “But your comprehension of me, I fear, is sorelylacking.” The old wizard was smiling now, and there was a gentle laughter650 *in his voice.Harry was trying not to go any colder than he already was; from somewhere there was pouring into his mind a blazing fury of resentment, atDumbledore’s condescension, and all the laughter that wise old fools hadever used in place of argument. “Funny thing, you know, I thought DracoMalfoy was going to be this impossible to talk to, and instead, in his childish innocence, he was a hundred times stronger than you.”A look of puzzlement crossed the old wizard’s face. “What do youmean?”“I mean,” Harry said, his voice biting, “that Draco actually took his ownbeliefs seriously and processed my words instead of throwing them out the window by smiling with gentle superiority. You’re so old and wise, you can’teven notice anything I’m saying! Not understand, notice!”“I have listened to you, Harry,” said Dumbledore, looking moresolemn now, “but to listen is not always to agree. Disagreements aside,what is it that you think I do not comprehend?”That if you really believed in an afterlife, you’d go down to St. Mungo’s andkill Neville’s parents, Alice and Frank Longbottom, so they could go on to theirnext great adventure, instead of letting them linger here in their damagedstate—Harry barely, barely kept himself from saying it out loud.“All right,” Harry said coldly. “I’ll answer your original question, then.You asked why Dark Wizards are afraid of death. Pretend, Headmaster,that you really believed in souls. Pretend that anyone could verify theexistence of souls at any time, pretend that nobody cried at funerals because they knew their loved ones were still alive. Now can you imaginedestroying a soul? Ripping it to shreds so that nothing remains to go on itsnext great adventure? Can you imagine what a terrible thing that wouldbe, the worst crime that had ever been committed in the history of theuniverse, which you would do anything to prevent from happening evenonce? Because that’s what Death really is—the annihilation of a soul!”The old wizard was staring at him, a sad look in his eyes. “I suppose Ido understand now,” he said quietly.“Oh?” said Harry. “Understand what?”“Voldemort,” said the old wizard. “I understand him now at last. Because to believe that the world is truly like that, you must believe there isno justice in it, that it is woven of darkness at its core. I asked you why hebecame a monster, and you could give no reason. And if I could ask him,I suppose, his answer would be: Why not?”They stood there gazing into each other’s eyes, the old wizard in his robes,and the young boy with the lightning-bolt scar on his forehead.“Tell me, Harry,” said the old wizard, “will you become a monster?”“No,” said the boy, an iron certainty in his voice.“Why not?” said the old wizard.The young boy stood very straight, his chin raised high and proud,and said: “There is no justice in the laws of Nature, Headmaster, no termfor fairness in the equations of motion. The universe is neither evil, norgood, it simply does not care. The stars don’t care, or the Sun, or the sky.But they don’t have to! We care! There is light in the world, and it is us!”“I wonder what will become of you, Harry,” said the old wizard. Hisvoice was soft, with a strange wonder and regret in it. “It is enough tomake me wish to live just to see it.”The boy bowed to him with heavy irony, and departed; and the oakendoor slammed shut behind him with a thud.652 *arry, holding the tea cup in the exactly correct way that ProfessorQuirrell had needed to demonstrate three times, took a small, careful sip. All the way across the long, wide table that was the centerpieceof Mary’s Room, Professor Quirrell took a sip from his own cup, makingit look far more natural and elegant. The tea itself was something whosename Harry couldn’t even pronounce, or at least, every time Harry hadtried to repeat the Chinese words, Professor Quirrell had corrected him,until finally Harry had given up.Harry had maneuvered himself into getting a glimpse at the bill lasttime, and Professor Quirrell had let him get away with it.He’d felt an impulse to drink a Comed-Tea first.Even taking that into account, Harry had still been shocked out of hisskin.And it still tasted to him like, well, tea.There was a quiet, nagging suspicion in Harry’s mind that ProfessorQuirrell knew this, and was deliberately buying ridiculously expensive teathat Harry couldn’t appreciate just to mess with him. Professor Quirrell himself might not like it all that much. Maybe nobody actually liked this tea,and the only point of it was to be ridiculously expensive and make thevictim feel unappreciative. In fact, maybe it was really just ordinary tea,only you asked for it in a certain code, and they put a fake gigantic priceon the bill…Professor Quirrell’s expression was drawn and thoughtful. “No,”Professor Quirrell said, “you should not have told the Headmaster about653 *your conversation with Lord Malfoy. Please try to think faster next time,Mr. Potter.”“I’m sorry, Professor Quirrell,” Harry said meekly. “I still don’t see it.”There were times when Harry felt very much like an impostor, pretendingto be cunning in Professor Quirrell’s presence.“Lord Malfoy is Albus Dumbledore’s opponent,” said Professor Quirrell. “At least for this present time. All Britain is their chessboard, all wizards their pieces. Consider: Lord Malfoy threatened to throw away everything, abandon his game, to take vengeance on you if Mr. Malfoy washurt. In which case, Mr. Potter…?”It took more long seconds for Harry to get it, but it was clear that Professor Quirrell wasn’t going to give any more hints, not that Harry wantedthem.Then Harry’s mind finally made the connection, and he frowned.“Dumbledore kills Draco, makes it look like I did it, and Lucius sacrificeshis game against Dumbledore to get at me? That… doesn’t seem like theHeadmaster’s style, Professor Quirrell…” Harry’s mind flashed back to asimilar warning from Draco, which had made Harry say the same thing.Professor Quirrell shrugged, and sipped his tea.Harry sipped his own tea, and sat in silence. The tablecloth spreadover the table was in a very peaceful pattern, seeming at first like plaincloth, but if you stared at it long enough, or kept silent long enough, youstarted to see a faint tracery of flowers glimmering on it; the curtains ofthe room had changed their pattern to match, and seemed to shimmeras though in a silent breeze. Professor Quirrell was in a contemplativemood that Saturday, and so was Harry, and Mary’s Room, it seemed, hadnot neglected to notice this.“Professor Quirrell,” Harry said suddenly, “is there an afterlife?”Harry had chosen the question carefully. Not, do you believe in an afterlife? but simply Is there an afterlife? What people really believed didn’tseem to them like beliefs at all. People didn’t say, ‘I strongly believe in thesky being blue!’ They just said, ‘the sky is blue’. Your true inner map ofthe world just felt to you like the way the world was…The Defense Professor raised his cup to his lips again before answering. His face was thoughtful. “If there is, Mr. Potter,” said Professor Quir*654 *rell, “then quite a few wizards have wasted a great deal of effort in theirsearches for immortality.”“That’s not actually an answer,” Harry observed. He’d learned by nowto notice that sort of thing when talking to Professor Quirrell.Professor Quirrell set down his teacup with a small, high-pitched tacking sound on his saucer. “Some of those wizards were reasonably intelligent, Mr. Potter, so you may take it that the existence of an afterlifeis not obvious. I have looked into the matter myself. There have beenmany claims of the sort which hope and fear would be expected to produce. Among those reports whose veracity is not in doubt, there is nothing which could not be the result of mere wizardry. There are certain devices said to communicate with the dead, but these, I suspect, only projectan image from the mind; the result seems indistinguishable from memory because it is memory. The alleged spirits tell no secrets they knewin life, nor could have learned after death, which are not known to thewielder—”“Which is why the Resurrection Stone is not the most valuable magical artifact in the world,” said Harry.“Precisely,” said Professor Quirrell, “though I wouldn’t say no to achance to try it.” There was a dry, thin smile on his lips; and somethingcolder, more distant, in his eyes. “You spoke to Dumbledore of that aswell, I take it.”Harry nodded.The curtains were taking on a faintly blue pattern, and a dim traceryof elaborate snowflakes now seemed to be becoming visible on the tablecloth. Professor Quirrell’s voice sounded very calm. “The Headmastercan be very persuasive, Mr. Potter. I hope he has not persuaded you.”“Heck no,” said Harry. “Didn’t fool me for a second.”“I should hope not,” said Professor Quirrell, still in that very calm tone.“I would be extremely put out to discover that the Headmaster had convinced you to throw away your life on some fool plot by telling you thatdeath is the next great adventure.”“I don’t think the Headmaster believed it himself, actually,” Harrysaid. He sipped his own tea again. “He asked me what I could possiblydo with eternity, gave me the usual line about it being boring, and he655 *didn’t seem to see any conflict between that and his own claim to have animmortal soul. In fact, he gave me a whole long lecture about how awfulit was to want immortality before he claimed to have an immortal soul. Ican’t quite visualize what must have been going on inside his head, but Idon’t think he actually had a mental model of himself continuing foreverin the afterlife…”The temperature of the room seemed to be dropping.“You perceive,” said a voice like ice from the other end of the table,“that Dumbledore does not truly believe as he speaks. It is not that hehas compromised his principles. It is that he never had them from thebeginning. Are you becoming cynical yet, Mr. Potter?”Harry had dropped his eyes to his teacup. “A little,” Harry said to hispossibly-ultra-high-quality, perhaps-ridiculously-expensive Chinese tea.“I’m certainly becoming a bit frustrated with… whatever’s going wrong inpeople’s heads.”“Yes,” said that icy voice. “I find it frustrating as well.”“Is there any way to get people not to do that?” said Harry to his teacup.“There is indeed a certain useful spell which solves the problem.”Harry looked up hopefully at that, and saw a cold, cold smile on theDefense Professor’s face.Then Harry got it. “I mean, besides Avada Kedavra.”The Defense Professor laughed. Harry didn’t.“Anyway,” Harry said hastily, “I did think fast enough not to suggestthe obvious idea about the Resurrection Stone in front of Dumbledore.Have you ever seen a stone with a line, inside a circle, inside a triangle?”The deathly chill seemed to draw back, fold into itself, as the ordinaryProfessor Quirrell returned. “Not that I can recall,” Professor Quirrellsaid after a while, a thoughtful frown on his face. “That is the Resurrection Stone?”Harry set aside his teacup, then drew on his saucer the symbol he hadseen on the inside of his cloak. And before Harry could take out his ownwand to cast the Hover Charm, the saucer went floating obligingly acrossthe table toward Professor Quirrell. Harry really wanted to learn thatwandless stuff, but that, apparently, was far above his current curriculum.656 *Professor Quirrell studied Harry’s tea-saucer for a moment, thenshook his head; and a moment later, the saucer went floating back toHarry.Harry put his teacup back on the saucer, noting absently as he did sothat the symbol he’d drawn had vanished. “If you happen to see a stonewith that symbol,” said Harry, “and it does talk to the afterlife, do let meknow. I have a few questions for Merlin or anyone who was around inAtlantis.”“Quite,” said Professor Quirrell. Then the Defense Professor lifted uphis teacup again, and tipped it back as though to finish the last of whatwas there. “By the way, Mr. Potter, I fear we shall have to cut short today’svisit to Diagon Alley. I was hoping it would—but never mind. Let it standthat there is something else I must do this afternoon.”Harry nodded, and finished his own tea, then rose from his seat at thesame time as Professor Quirrell.“One last question,” Harry said, as Professor Quirrell’s coat lifted itselfoff the coatrack and went floating toward the Defense Professor. “Magicis loose in the world, and I no longer trust my guesses so much as I oncedid. So in your own best guess and without any wishful thinking, do youbelieve there’s an afterlife?”“If I did, Mr. Potter,” said Professor Quirrell as he shrugged on hiscoat, “would I still be here?”657 *January wind howled around the vast, blank stone wallsThethatbitingdemarcated the material bounds of the castle Hogwarts, whis-pering and whistling in odd pitches as it blew past closed windows andstone turrets. The most recent snow had mostly blown away, but occasional patches of melted and refrozen ice still stuck to the stone face andblazed reflected sunlight. From a distance, it must have looked like Hogwarts was blinking hundreds of eyes.A sudden gust made Draco flinch, and try, impossibly, to press hisbody even closer to the stone, which felt like ice and smelled like ice. Someutterly pointless instinct seemed convinced that he was about to be blownoff the outer wall of Hogwarts, and that the best way to prevent this wasto jerk around in helpless reflex and possibly throw up.Draco was trying very hard not to think about the six stories worth ofempty air underneath him, and focus, instead, on how he was going tokill Harry Potter.“You know, Mr. Malfoy,” said the young girl beside him in a conversational voice, “if a seer had told me that someday I’d be hanging onto theside of a castle by my fingertips, trying not to look down or think abouthow loud Mum’d scream if she saw me, I wouldn’t’ve had any idea of howit’d happen, except that it’d be Harry Potter’s fault.”659 *Earlier:The two allied Generals stepped together over Longbottom’s body,their boots hitting the floor in almost perfect synchrony.Only a single soldier now stood between them and Harry, a Slytherinboy named Samuel Clamons, whose hand was clenched white around hiswand, held upward to sustain his Prismatic Wall. The boy’s breathingwas coming rapidly, but his face showed the same cold determinationthat lit the eyes of his general, Harry Potter, who was standing behind thePrismatic Wall at the dead end of the corridor next to an open window,with his hands held mysteriously behind his back.The battle had been ridiculously difficult, for the enemy being outnumbered two-to-one. It should have been easy, Dragon Army and theSunshine Regiment had melded together easily in practice sessions,they’d fought each other long enough to know each other very well indeed. Morale was high, both armies knowing that this time they weren’tjust fighting to win for themselves, but fighting for a world free oftraitors. Despite the surprised protests of both generals, the soldiersof the combined army had insisted on calling themselves Dramione’sSungon Argiment, and produced patches for their insignia of a smilingface wreathed in flames.But Harry’s soldiers had all blackened their own insignia—it didn’tlook like paint, more like they’d burned that part of their uniforms—andthey’d fought all through the upper levels of Hogwarts with a desperatefury. The cold rage that Draco sometimes saw in Harry had seemed totrickle down into his soldiers, and they’d fought like it hadn’t been play.And Harry had emptied out his entire bag of tricks, there’d been tinymetal balls (Granger had identified them as “ball bearings”) on floors andstaircases, rendering them impassable until cleared, only Harry’s armyhad already practiced coordinated Hover Charms and they could fly theirown people right over the obstacles they’d made…You couldn’t bring devices into the game from outside, but you couldTransfigure anything you wanted during the game, so long as it was safe.And that just wasn’t fair when you were fighting a boy raised by scientists,660 *who knew about things like ball bearings and skateboards and bungeecords.And so it had come to this.The survivors of the allied forces had cornered the last remnants ofHarry Potter’s army in a dead-end corridor.Weasley and Vincent had rushed Longbottom at the same time, moving together like they’d practiced for weeks instead of hours, and somehow Longbottom had managed to hex them both before falling himself.And now it was Draco and Granger and Padma and Samuel and Harry,and by the looks of Samuel, his Prismatic Wall couldn’t last much longer.Draco had already leveled his wand at Harry, waiting for the Prismatic Wall to fall of its own accord; there was no need to waste a BreakingDrill Hex before then. Padma leveled her own wand at Samuel, Grangerleveled hers at Harry…Harry was still hiding his hands behind his back, instead of aiminghis wand; and looking at them with a face that could have been carvedout of ice.It might be a bluff. It probably wasn’t.There was a brief, tense silence.And then Harry spoke.“I’m the villain now,” the young boy said coldly, “and if you think villains are this easy to finish off, you’d better think again. Beat me whenI’m fighting seriously, and I’ll stay beaten; but lose, and we’ll be doing thisall over again next time.”The boy brought his hands forward, and Draco saw that Harry waswearing strange gloves, with a peculiar grayish material on the fingertips,and buckles that stapped the gloves tightly to his wrists.Beside Draco, the Sunshine General gasped in horror; and Draco,without even asking why, fired a Breaking Drill Hex.Samuel staggered, he let out a scream as he staggered, but he held theWall; and if Padma or Granger fired now, they would exhaust their ownforces so badly that they might just lose.“Harry!” shouted Granger. “You can’t be serious!”Harry was already in motion.And as he swung out the open window, his cold voice said, “Follow ifyou dare.”The icy wind howled around them.Draco’s arms were already starting to feel tired.…It had developed that, yesterday, Harry had carefully demonstratedto Granger exactly how to Transfigure the gloves he was currently wearing, which used something called ‘gecko setae’; and how to glue Transfigured patches of the same material to the toes of their shoes; and Harryand Granger had, in innocent childish play, tried climbing around thewalls and ceiling a little.And that, also yesterday, Harry had supplied Granger with a grandtotal of exactly two doses of Feather-Falling Potion to carry around in herpouch, “just in case”.Not that Padma would have followed them, anyway. She wasn’t crazy.Draco carefully peeled loose his right hand, stretched it over as far ashe could, and slapped it down on the stone again. Beside him, Grangerdid the same.They’d already swallowed the Feather-Falling Potion. It was skirtingthe edges of the game rules, but the potion wouldn’t be activated unlessone of them actually fell, and so long as they didn’t fall they weren’t usingthe item.Professor Quirrell was watching them.The two of them were perfectly, completely, utterly safe.Harry Potter, on the other hand, was going to die.“I wonder why Harry is doing this,” said General Granger in a reflective tone, as she slowly peeled the fingertips of one hand off the wall withan extended sticky sound. Her hand plopped back down again almost assoon as it was lifted. “I’ll have to ask him that after I kill him.”It was amazing how much the two of them were turning out to havein common.Draco didn’t really feel like talking right now, but he managed to say,through gritted teeth, “Could be revenge. For the date.”662 *“Really,” said Granger. “After all this time.”Stick. Plop.“How sweet of him,” said Granger.Stick. Plop.“I guess I’ll find some truly romantic way to thank him,” said Granger.Stick. Plop.“What’s he got against you?” said Granger.Stick. Plop.The icy wind howled around them.One might have thought it would feel safer to have ground under yourfeet again.But if that ground was a slanted roof tiled with rough slats, whichhad rather a lot more ice on it than the stone walls, and you were runningacross it at a high rate of speed…Then you would be sadly mistaken.“Luminos!” shouted Draco.“Luminos!” shouted Granger.“Luminos!” shouted Draco.“Luminos!” shouted Granger.The distant figure was dodging and scrambling as it ran, and not asingle shot hit, but they were gaining.Until Granger slipped.It was inevitable, in retrospect, in real life you couldn’t actually runacross icy slanted rooftops at a high rate of speed.And also inevitably, because it happened without the slightestthought, Draco spun and grabbed for Granger’s right arm, and hecaught her, only she was already too far off balance, she was falling andpulling Draco with her, it all happened so quickly—There was a hard, painful impact, not just Draco’s weight hitting therooftop but some of Granger’s weight too, and if she’d hit just a little bit663 *closer to the edge they could have made it, but instead her body tippedagain and her legs slipped off and her other hand grabbed frantically…And that was how Draco ended up holding onto Granger’s arm in awhite grip, while her other hand clenched frantically at the edge of therooftop and the toes of Draco’s shoes dug into the edge of a roof tile.“Hermione!” Harry’s voice shrieked distantly.“Draco,” whispered Granger’s voice, and Draco looked down.That might have been a mistake. There was a lot of air underneathher, nothing but air, they were on the edge of a rooftop that had juttedout from the main stone wall of Hogwarts.“He’s going to come help me,” whispered the girl, “but first he’s goingto Luminos both of us, there’s no way he wouldn’t. You have to let me go.”It should have been the easiest thing in the world.She was just a mudblood, just a mudblood, just a mudblood!She wouldn’t even be hurt!…Draco’s brain wasn’t listening to anything Draco was telling it rightnow.“Do it,” Hermione Granger whispered, her eyes blazing without a single trace of fear, “do it, Draco, do it, you can beat him yourself we have towin Draco!”There was a sound of someone running and it was coming closer.Oh, be rational…The voice in Draco’s head sounded an awful lot like Harry Potter teaching lessons.…are you going to let your brain run your life?664 *Aftermath, 1:It was taking a bit of an effort for Daphne Greengrass to keep herself quiet, as Millicent Bulstrode retold the story in the Slytherin girls’common room (a cozy cool place in the dungeons running beneath theHogwarts Lake, with fish swimming past every window, and couches youcould lie down in if you wanted). Mostly because, in Daphne’s opinion, itwas a perfectly good story already without all of Millicent’s improvements.“And then what?” gasped Flora and Hestia Carrow.“General Granger looked up at him,” Millicent said dramatically, “andshe said, ‘Draco! You’ve got to let go of me! Don’t worry about me, Draco,I promise I’ll be all right!’ And what do you suppose Malfoy did then?”“He said ‘Never!’,” shouted Charlotte Wiland, “and held on eventighter!”All the listening girls except Pansy Parkinson nodded.“Nope!” said Millicent. “He dropped her. And then he jumped up andshot General Potter. The end.”There was a stunned pause.“You can’t do that!” said Charlotte.“She’s a mudblood,” said Pansy, sounding confused. “Of course he letgo!”“Well, Malfoy shouldn’t have grabbed her in the first place, then!” saidCharlotte. “But once he grabbed her, he had to hang on! Especially in theface of approaching certain doom!” Tracey Davis, sitting next to Daphne,was nodding along in firm agreement.“I don’t see why,” said Pansy.“That’s because you don’t have the tiniest smidgin of romance in you,”said Tracey. “Besides, you can’t just go dropping girls. A boy who’d dropa girl like that… he’d drop anyone. He’d drop you, Pansy.”“What d’you mean, drop me?” Pansy said.Daphne couldn’t resist any more. “You know,” Daphne said darkly,“you’re eating breakfast one day at our table, and the next thing you know,Malfoy lets go of you, and you’re falling off the top of Hogwarts! That’swhat!”“Yeah!” said Charlotte. “He’s a witch dropper!”665 *“You know why Atlantis fell?” said Tracey. “’Cause someone like Malfoy dropped it, that’s why!”Daphne lowered her voice. “In fact… what if Malfoy’s the one whomade Hermione, I mean General Granger, slip in the first place? What ifhe’s out to make all the Muggleborns trip and fall?”“You mean—?” gasped Tracey.“That’s right!” Daphne said dramatically. “What if Malfoy is—the heirof Slipperin?”“The next Drop Lord!” said Tracey.Which was far too good a line for anyone to keep to themselves, soby nightfall it was all over Hogwarts, and the next morning it was theQuibbler’s headline.Aftermath, 2:Hermione made sure she got to their usual classroom nice and earlythat evening, just so that she would be by herself, in a chair, peacefullyreading a book, when Harry got there.If there was any way for a door to creak open apologetically, that washow the door was creaking open.“Um,” said Harry Potter’s voice.Hermione kept reading.“I’m, um, kinda sorry, I didn’t mean for you to actually fall off the roofor anything…”It had been quite an entertaining experience, in fact.“I, ah… I don’t have much experience apologizing, I’ll fall to my kneesif you want, or buy you something expensive, Hermione I don’t know how toapologize to you for this what can I do just tell me?”She kept reading the book in silence.It wasn’t as if she had any idea how Harry could apologize, either.Right now she was just feeling a sort of odd curiosity as to what wouldhappen if she kept reading her book for a while.666 *omantic?” Hermione said. “They’re both boys!”“Wow,” Daphne said, sounding a little shocked. “You mean Muggles really do hate that? I thought that was just something the DeathEaters made up.”“No,” said an older Slytherin girl Hermione didn’t recognize, “it’s true,they have to get married in secret, and if they’re ever discovered, they getburned at the stake together. And if you’re a girl who thinks it’s romantic,they burn you too.”“That can’t be right!” objected a Gryffindor girl, while Hermione wasstill trying to sort out what to say to that. “There wouldn’t be any Mugglegirls left!”She’d kept on reading quietly, and Harry Potter had kept on trying toapologize, and it had soon dawned on Hermione that Harry had realized,possibly for the first time in his life, that he’d done something annoying;and that Harry, definitely for the first time in his life, was terrified thathe’d lost her as a friend; and she’d started to feel (a) guilty and (b) worriedabout the direction Harry’s increasingly desperate offers were going. Butshe still had no idea what sort of apology was appropriate, so she’d saidthat the Ravenclaw girls should vote on it—and this time she wouldn’tfix the outcome, though she hadn’t mentioned that part—to which Harryhad instantly agreed.The next day, practically every Ravenclaw girl over the age of thirteenhad voted to have Draco drop Harry.Hermione had felt mildly disappointed it was that simple, though itwas obviously fair.667 *Right now, however, standing just outside the great doors of the castle amid half the female population of Hogwarts, Hermione was beginning to suspect that there were things going on here that she did not understand and that she desperately hoped neither of her fellow generalsever heard about.You couldn’t really see the details from up there, just the general fact of asea of expectant female faces.“You’ve got no idea what this is about, do you?” said Draco, soundingamused.Harry had read a fair number of books he wasn’t supposed to read,not to mention a few Quibbler headlines.“Boy-Who-Lived gets Draco Malfoy pregnant?” said Harry.“Okay, you do know what this is about,” said Draco. “I thought Muggles hated that?”“Only the dumb ones,” said Harry. “But, um, aren’t we, uh, a littleyoung?”“Not too young for them,” said Draco. He snorted. “Girls!”They silently walked toward the edge of the roof.“So I’m doing this for revenge on you,” said Draco, “but why are youdoing this?”Harry’s mind made a lightning calculation, weighing the factors,whether it was too soon…“Honestly?” said Harry. “Because I meant to have her climb up the icywalls, but I didn’t mean to have her fall off the roof. And, um, I kinda didfeel really awful about that. I mean, I guess I actually did start seeing heras my friendly rival after a while. So this is a real apology to her, not a plotor anything.”There was a pause.Then—“Yeah,” said Draco. “I understand.”Harry didn’t smile. It might have been the most difficult nonsmile ofhis life.668 *Draco looked at the edge of the roof, and made a face. “This is goingto be a lot harder to do on purpose than by accident, isn’t it.”Harry’s other hand held the roof in a reflexively terrified grip, his fingerswhite on the cold, cold stone.You could know with your conscious mind that you’d drunk theFeather-Falling Potion. Knowing it with your unconscious mind wasanother matter entirely.It was every bit as scary as Harry had thought it might have been forHermione, which was justice.“Draco,” said Harry, controlling his voice wasn’t easy, but the Ravenclaw girls had given them a script, “You’ve got to let me go!”“Okay!” said Draco, and let go of Harry’s arm.Harry’s other hand scrabbled at the edge, and then, without any decision being made, his fingers failed, and Harry fell.There was a brief moment when Harry’s stomach tried to leap up intohis throat, and his body tried desperately to orient itself in the absence ofany possible way to do so.There was a brief moment when Harry could feel the Feather-FallingPotion kicking in, starting to slow him, a sort of lurching, cushioning feeling.And then something pulled on Harry and he accelerated downwardagain faster than gravity—Harry’s mouth had already opened and begun screaming while partof his brain tried to think of something creative he could do, part of hisbrain tried to calculate how much time he had left to be creative, and atiny rump part of his brain noticed that he wasn’t even going to finishthe remaining-time calculation before he hit the ground—669 *Harry was desperately trying to control his hyperventilating, and itwasn’t helping him to hear the shrieking of all the girls, now lying inheaps on the ground and each other.“Good heavens,” said the unfamiliar man, he of the old-lookingclothes and faintly scarred face, who was holding Harry in his arms. “Ofall the ways I imagined we might meet again someday, I didn’t expect itto be you falling out of the sky.”Harry remembered the last thing he’d seen, the falling body, and managed to gasp, “Professor… Quirrell…”“He’ll be all right after a few hours,” said the unfamiliar man holdingHarry. “He’s just exhausted. I wouldn’t have thought it possible… he musthave knocked down two hundred students just to make sure he got whoeverwas jinxing you…”Gently, the man set Harry upright on the ground, supporting him thewhile.Harry carefully balanced himself, and nodded to the man.He let go, and Harry promptly fell over.The man helped him rise again. Making sure, at all times, to standbetween Harry and the girls now picking themselves up from the ground,his head constantly glancing in that direction.“Harry,” the man said quietly, and very seriously, “do you have anyidea which of these girls might have wanted to kill you?”“Not murder,” said a strained voice. “Just stupidity.”This time it was the unfamiliar man who seemed to almost fall over,utter shock on his face.Professor Quirrell was already sitting up from where he’d fallen onthe grass.“Good heavens!” gasped the man. “You shouldn’t be—”“Mr. Lupin, your concerns are misplaced. No wizard, no matter howpowerful, casts such a Charm by strength alone. You must do it by beingefficient.”Professor Quirrell didn’t stand up, though.“Thank you,” Harry whispered. And then, “Thank you,” to the manstanding beside him as well.“What happened?” said the man.670 *“I should have foreseen it myself,” Professor Quirrell said, his voicecrisp with disapproval. “Some number of girls tried to summon Mr. Potter to their own, particular arms. Individually, I suppose, they all thoughtthey were being gentle.”Oh.“Consider it a lesson in preparedness, Mr. Potter,” said ProfessorQuirrell. “Had I not insisted that there be more than one adult witness tothis little event, and that both of us have our wands out, Mr. Lupin wouldnot have been available to slow your fall afterward, and you would havebeen gravely injured.”“Sir!” said the man—Mr. Lupin, apparently. “You should not say suchthings to the boy!”“Who is—” Harry started to say.“The only other person who was available to watch, besides myself,”said Professor Quirrell. “I introduce you to Remus Lupin, who is heretemporarily to instruct students in the Patronus Charm. Though I amtold that the two of you have already met.”Harry studied the man, puzzled. He should have remembered thatfaintly scarred face, that strange, gentle smile.“Where did we meet?” said Harry.“In Godric’s Hollow,” said the man. “I changed a number of yournappies.”Mr. Lupin’s temporary office was a small stone room with a small woodendesk, and Harry couldn’t see anything of what Mr. Lupin was sitting on,suggesting that it was a small stool just like the one in front of his desk.Harry guessed that Mr. Lupin wouldn’t be at Hogwarts for long, or usethis office much, and so he’d told the house elves not to waste the effort.It said something about a person that he tried not to bother house elves.Specifically, it said that he’d been Sorted into Hufflepuff, since, to thebest of Harry’s knowledge, Hermione was the only non-Hufflepuff whoworried about bothering house elves. (Harry himself thought her qualmsrather silly. Whoever had created house elves in the first place had beenunspeakably evil, obviously; but that didn’t mean Hermione was doingthe right thing now by denying sentient beings the drudgery they hadbeen shaped to enjoy.)“Please sit down, Harry,” the man said quietly. His formal robes wereof low quality, not quite tattered, but visibly worn by the passage of timein a way that simple Repair Charms couldn’t fix; shabby was the word thatcame to mind. And despite that, somehow, there was a dignity abouthim that couldn’t have been obtained by fine and expensive robes, thatwouldn’t have fit with fine robes, that was the exclusive property of theshabby. Harry had heard of humility, but he’d never seen the real thingbefore—only the satisfied modesty of people who thought it was part oftheir style and wanted you to notice.Harry took a seat on the small wooden stool in front of Mr. Lupin’sshort desk.“Thank you for coming,” the man said.“No, thank you for saving me,” said Harry. “Let me know if you everneed something impossible done.”The man seemed to hesitate. “Harry, may I… ask a personal question?”“You can ask, certainly,” Harry said. “I have a lot of questions for you,too.”Mr. Lupin nodded. “Harry, are your stepparents treating you well?”“My parents,” Harry said. “I have four. Michael, James, Petunia, andLily.”“Ah,” said Mr. Lupin. And then, “Ah” again. He seemed to be blinkingrather hard. “I… that is good to hear, Harry, Dumbledore would tell noneof us where you were… I was afraid he might think you ought to havewicked stepparents, or some such… ”Harry wasn’t sure Mr. Lupin’s concern had been misplaced, considering his own first encounter with Dumbledore; but it had all turned outwell enough, so he said nothing. “What about my…” Harry searched for aword that didn’t raise them higher or put them lower… “other parents? Iwant to know, well, everything.”“A tall order,” Mr. Lupin said. He wiped a hand across his forehead.“Well, let us begin at the beginning. When you were born, James was sohappy that he couldn’t touch his wand without it glowing gold, for a whole672 *week. And even after that, whenever he held you, or saw Lily holding you,or just thought of you, it would happen again—”Every now and then Harry would look at his watch, and find that anotherthirty minutes had passed. He felt slightly bad about making Remus missdinner, especially since Harry himself would just drop back to 7pm later,but that wasn’t enough to stop either of them.Finally Harry screwed up enough courage to ask the critical question,while Remus was in the middle of an extended discourse on the wondersof James’s Quidditch that Harry couldn’t find the heart to squash moredirectly.“And that was when,” Remus said, his eyes shining brightly, “Jamespulled off a triple reverse Mulhanney Dive with extra backspin! The wholecrowd went wild, even some of the Hufflepuffs were cheering—”I guess you had to be there, Harry thought—not that being there wouldhave helped in any way—and said, “Mr. Lupin?”Something about Harry’s voice must have reached the man, becausehe stopped in mid-sentence.“Was my father a bully?” said Harry.Remus looked at Harry for a long moment. “For a little while,” Remussaid. “He grew out of it soon enough. Where did you hear that?”Harry didn’t answer, he was trying to think of something true to saythat would deflect suspicion, but he didn’t think fast enough.“Never mind,” said Remus, and sighed. “I can guess who.” The faintlyscarred face was pinched in disapproval. “What a thing to tell—”“Did my father have any extenuating circumstances?” Harry said.“Poor home life, or something like that? Or was he just… being naturallynasty?” Cold?Remus’s hand swept his hair back, the first nervous gesture Harry hadseen from him. “Harry,” Remus said, “you can’t judge your father by whathe did as a young boy!”“I’m a young boy,” Harry said, “and I judge myself.”673 *Remus blinked twice at that.“I want to know why,” Harry said. “I want to understand, because tome, it seems like there isn’t any possible excuse for that!” Voice shakinga bit. “Please tell me anything you know about why he did it, even if itdoesn’t sound nice.” So I don’t fall into the same trap myself, whatever it is.“It was the thing to do if you were in Gryffindor,” Remus said, slowly,reluctantly. “And… I didn’t think so back then, I thought it was the otherway around, but… it might have been Black who got James into it, really…Black wanted so much to show everyone that he was against Slytherin,you see, we all wanted to believe that blood wasn’t destiny—”“No, Harry,” said Remus. “I don’t know why Black went after Peter instead of running. It was as though Black was making tragedy for the sakeof tragedy that day.” The man’s voice was unsteady. “There was no hint,no warning, we all thought—to think that he was to be—” Remus’s voicecut off.Harry was crying, he couldn’t help it, it hurt worse to hear it fromRemus than anything he’d ever felt himself. Harry had lost two parentshe didn’t remember, knew only from stories. Remus Lupin had lost allfour of his best friends in less than twenty-four hours; and for the loss ofhis last remaining one, Peter Pettigrew, there’d just been no reason at all.“Sometimes it still hurts to think of him in Azkaban,” Remus finished,his voice almost a whisper. “I am glad, Harry, that Death Eaters are notallowed visitors. It means I do not have to feel ashamed of not going.”Harry had to swallow hard several times before he could speak. “Canyou tell me about Peter Pettigrew? He was my father’s friend, and itseems—that I should know, that I should remember—”Remus nodded, water glittering in his own eyes now. “I think, Harry,that if Peter had known it would end that way—” the man’s voice chokedup. “Peter was more afraid of the Dark Lord than any of us, and if he’dknown it would end that way, I don’t think he would have done it. ButPeter knew the risk, Harry, he knew the risk was real, that it could happen,674 *and yet he stayed by James and Lily’s side. All through Hogwarts I used towonder why Peter hadn’t been sorted into Slytherin, or maybe Ravenclaw,because Peter so adored secrets, he couldn’t resist them, he would findout things about people, things they wanted kept hidden—” A brief wrylook crossed Remus’s face. “But he didn’t use those secrets, Harry. He justwanted to know. And then the Dark Lord’s shadow fell over everything,and Peter stood by James and Lily and put his talents to good use, and Iunderstood why the Hat had sent him to Gryffindor.” Remus’s voice wasfierce now, and proud. “It’s easy to stand by your friends if you’re a herolike Godric, bold and strong like people think Gryffindors should be. Butif Peter was more afraid than any of us, doesn’t that also make him themost brave?”“It does,” Harry said. His own voice was choked to where he almostcouldn’t talk. “If you could, Mr. Lupin, if you have time, there’s someoneelse who I think should hear Peter Pettigrew’s story, a student in firstyear Hufflepuff, named Neville Longbottom.”“Alice and Frank’s boy,” said Remus, his voice turning sad. “I see. Itis not a happy story, Harry, but I can tell it again, if you think it will helphim.”Harry nodded.A brief silence fell.“Did Black have any unfinished business with Peter Pettigrew?”Harry said. “Anything that would make him seek out Mr. Pettigrew, evenif it wasn’t a killing matter? Like a secret Mr. Pettigrew knew, that Blackwanted to know himself, or wanted to kill him to hide?”Something flickered in Remus’s eyes, but the older man shook hishead, and said, “Not really.”“That means there is something,” said Harry.That wry smile appeared again beneath the salt-and-pepper mustache. “You have a bit of Peter in you yourself, I see. But it’s not important,Harry.”“I’m a Ravenclaw, I’m not supposed to resist the temptation of secrets.And,” Harry said more seriously, “if it was worth Black getting caught, Ican’t help but think it might matter.”675 *Remus looked quite uncomfortable. “I suppose I could tell you whenyou’re older, but really, Harry, it’s not important! Just something fromour school days.”Harry couldn’t have put his finger on exactly what tipped him off; itmight have been something about the exact tone of nervousness in Remus’s voice, or the way the man had said when you’re older, that sparkedthe sudden leap of Harry’s intuition…“Actually,” said Harry, “I think I’ve sort of guessed it already, sorry.”Remus raised his eyebrows. “Have you?” He sounded a bit skeptical.“They were lovers, weren’t they?”There was an awkward pause.Remus gave a slow, grave nod.“Once,” Remus said. “A long time ago. A sad affair, ending in vasttragedy, or so it seemed to us all when we were young.” The unhappypuzzlement was plain on his face. “But I had thought that long since overand done and buried beneath adult friendship, until the day that Blackkilled Peter.”676 *he gentle sun of January shone on the cold fields outside Hogwarts.TFor some of the students it was a study hour, and others had beenlet out of class. The first-years who’d signed up for it were practicing acertain spell, a spell that was most advantageously learned outdoors, beneath the bright sun and a clear blue sky, rather than within the confinesof any classroom. Cookies and lemonade were also considered helpful.The early gestures of the spell were complex and precise; you twitchedyour wand once, twice, thrice, and four times with small tilts at exactlythe right relative angles, you shifted your forefinger and thumb exactlythe right distances…The Ministry thought this meant it was futile to try and teach anyonethe spell before their fifth year. There had been a few known cases ofyounger children learning it, and this had been dismissed as “genius”.It might not have been a very polite way of putting it, but Harry wasbeginning to see why Professor Quirrell had claimed that the MinistryCommittee of Curriculum would have been of greater benefit to wizardkind if they had been used as landfill.So the gestures were complicated and delicate. That didn’t stop youfrom learning it when you were eleven. It meant you had to be extra careful and practice each part for a lot longer than usual, that was all.Most Charms that could only be learned by older students were likethat because they required more strength of magic than any young student could muster. But the Patronus Charm wasn’t like that, it wasn’t difficult because it needed too much magic, it was difficult because it tookmore than mere magic.677 *It took the warm, happy feelings that you kept close in your heart, theloving memories, a different kind of strength that you didn’t need for ordinary spells.Harry twitched his wand once, twice, thrice and four times, shiftedhis fingers exactly the right distances…“Good luck at school, Harry. Do you think I bought you enough books?”“You can never have enough books… but you certainly tried, it was a really,really, really good try…”It had brought tears to his eyes, the first time Harry had rememberedand tried to put it into the spell.Harry brought the wand up and around and brandished it, a gesturethat didn’t have to be precise, only bold and defiant.“Expecto Patronum!” cried Harry.Nothing happened.Not a single flicker of light.When Harry looked up, Remus Lupin was still studying the wand, arather troubled look on his faintly scarred face.Finally Remus shook his head. “I’m sorry, Harry,” the man said quietly. “Your wandwork was exactly right.”And there wasn’t a flicker of light anywhere else, either, because allthe other first-years who were supposed to be practicing their PatronusCharms had been glancing out of the corners of their eyes at Harry instead.The tears were threatening to come back into Harry’s eyes, and theyweren’t happy tears. Of all the things, of all the things, Harry had neverexpected this.There was something horribly humiliating about being informed thatyou weren’t happy enough.What did Anthony Goldstein have inside him that Harry didn’t, thatmade Anthony’s wand shine with that bright light?Did Anthony love his own father more?“What thought were you using to cast it?” said Remus.“My father,” Harry said, his voice trembling. “I asked him to buy mesome books before I came to Hogwarts, and he did, and they were expensive, and then he asked me if they were enough—”678 *Harry didn’t try to explain about the Verres family motto.“Take a rest before you try a different thought, Harry,” said Remus.He gestured toward where some other students were sitting on theground, looking disappointed or embarrassed or regretful. “You won’tbe able to cast a Patronus Charm while you’re feeling ashamed of notbeing grateful enough.” There was a gentle compassion in Mr. Lupin’svoice, and for a moment, Harry felt like hitting something.Instead Harry turned around, and stalked to where the other failureswere sitting. The other students whose wandwork had also been proclaimed perfect, and who were now supposed to be searching for happierthoughts; by the looks of them they weren’t making much progress. Therewere many robes there trimmed in dark blue, and a handful of red, andone lone Hufflepuff girl who was still crying. The Slytherins hadn’t evenbothered showing up, except for Daphne Greengrass and Tracey Davis,who were still trying to get the gestures.Harry plopped down on the cold dead grass of winter, next to the student whose failure had surprised him the most.“So you couldn’t do it either,” Hermione said. She’d fled the field atfirst, but she’d come back after that, and you had to look closely at herreddened eyes to see that she’d been crying.“I,” Harry said, “I, I’d probably feel a lot worse about that if you hadn’tfailed, you’re the nicest, person I know, that I’ve ever met, Hermione, andif you also can’t do it, it means I might still be, be good…”“I should have gone to Gryffindor,” Hermione whispered. She blinkedhard a few times, but she didn’t wipe her eyes.The boy and the girl walked forward together, definitely not holdinghands, but each drawing a kind of strength from the other’s presence,something that let them ignore the whispers of their year-mates, as theywalked through the hallway approaching the great doors of Hogwarts.Harry hadn’t been able to cast the Patronus Charm no matter whathappy thought he tried. People hadn’t seemed surprised by that, which679 *made it even worse. Hermione hadn’t been able to do it either. Peoplehad been very surprised by that, and Harry had seen her starting to get thesame sidelong looks as him. The other Ravenclaws who’d failed weren’tgetting those looks. But Hermione was the Sunshine General, and herfans were treating it like she’d failed them, somehow, like she’d betrayeda promise she’d never made.The two of them had gone to the library to research the PatronusCharm, which was Hermione’s way of dealing with distress, as it wassometimes also Harry’s. Study, learn, try to understand why…The books had confirmed what the Headmaster had told Harry; often,wizards who couldn’t cast the Patronus Charm in practice would be ableto do so in the presence of a real Dementor, going from flat failure all theway to a full corporeal Patronus. It defied all logic, the Dementor’s auraof fear ought to make it harder to wield a happy thought; but that was theway it was.So the two of them were both going to give it one last try, there wasno way either of them wouldn’t give it one last try.It was the day the Dementor came to Hogwarts.Earlier, Harry had unTransfigured his father’s rock from where it usually rested on his pinky ring in the form of a tiny diamond, and placed thehuge gray stone back into his pouch. Just in case Harry’s magic failed entirely, when he confronted the darkest of all creatures.Harry had already started to feel pessimistic, and he wasn’t even infront of a Dementor yet.“I bet you can do it and I can’t,” Harry said in a whisper. “I bet that’swhat happens.”“It felt wrong to me,” Hermione said, her voice even quieter than his.“I tried it this morning and I realized. When I was doing the brandish atthe end, even before I said the words, it felt wrong.”Harry didn’t say anything. He’d felt the same thing, right from thestart, though it had taken another five attempts using five other happythoughts before he’d been able to acknowledge it to himself. Every timehe tried to brandish his wand, it had felt hollow; the spell he was tryingto learn didn’t fit him.“It doesn’t mean we’re going to be Dark Wizards,” said Harry. “Lots ofpeople who can’t cast the Patronus Charm aren’t Dark Wizards. GodricGryffindor wasn’t a Dark Wizard…”Godric had defeated Dark Lords, fought to protect commoners fromNoble Houses and Muggles from wizards. He’d had many fine friendsand true, and lost no more than half of them in one good cause or another.He’d listened to the screams of the wounded, in the armies he’d raisedto defend the innocent; young wizards of courage had rallied to his calls,and he’d buried them afterward. Until finally, when his wizardry had onlyjust begun to fail him in his old age, he’d brought together the three othermost powerful wizards of his era to raise Hogwarts from the bare ground;the one great accomplishment to Godric’s name that wasn’t about war,any kind of war, no matter how just. It was Salazar, and not Godric, who’dtaught the first Hogwarts class in Battle Magic. Godric had taught thefirst Hogwarts class in Herbology, the magics of green growing life.To his last day he’d never been able to cast the Patronus Charm.Godric Gryffindor had been a good man, not a happy one.Harry didn’t believe in angst, he couldn’t stand reading about whinyheroes, he knew a billion other people in the world would have given anything to trade places with him, and…And on his deathbed, Godric had told Helga (for Salazar had abandoned him, and Rowena passed before) that he didn’t regret any of it, andhe was not warning his students not to follow in his footsteps, no one wasever to say he’d told anyone not to follow in his footsteps. If it had beenthe right thing for him to do, then he wouldn’t tell anyone else to choosewrongly, not even the youngest student in Hogwarts. And yet for thosewho did follow in his footsteps, he hoped they would remember that Gryffindor had told his House that it was all right for them to be happier thanhim. That red and gold would be bright warm colors, from now on.And Helga had promised him, weeping, that when she was Headmistress she would make sure of it.Whereupon Godric had died, and left no ghost behind him; and Harryhad shoved the book back to Hermione and walked away a little, so shewouldn’t see him crying.You wouldn’t think that a book with an innocent title like “The Patronus Charm: Wizards Who Could and Couldn’t” would be the saddestbook Harry had ever read.Harry…Harry didn’t want that.To be in that book.Harry didn’t want that.The rest of the school just seemed to think that No Patronus meantBad Person, plain and simple. Somehow the fact that Godric Gryffindoralso hadn’t been able to cast the Patronus Charm seemed not to get repeated. Maybe people didn’t talk about it to respect his last wish, Fredand George probably didn’t know and Harry certainly wasn’t about to tellthem. Or maybe the other failures didn’t mention it because it was lessshameful, the smaller loss of pride and status, to be thought Dark ratherthan unhappy.Harry saw that Hermione, beside him, was blinking hard; and he wondered if she was thinking of Rowena Ravenclaw, who’d also loved books.“Okay,” Harry whispered. “Happier thoughts. If you do go to a fullcorporeal Patronus, what do you think your animal will be?”“An otter,” Hermione said at once.“An otter?” Harry whispered incredulously.“Yes, an otter,” said Hermione. “What about yours?”“Peregrine falcon,” Harry said without hesitation. “It can dive fasterthan three hundred kilometers per hour, it’s the fastest living creaturethere is.” The peregrine falcon had been Harry’s favorite animal sinceforever. Harry was determined to become an Animagus someday, just toget that as his form, and fly by the strength of his own wings, and see theland below with sharper eyes… “But why an otter?”Hermione smiled, but didn’t say anything.And the vast doors of Hogwarts swung open.They walked for a time, the children, over a pathway that led towardthe unforbidden forest, and continued through the forest itself. The Sunwas lowering to near the horizon, the shadows long, the sunlight filteredthrough the bare branches of the winter trees; for it was January, and thefirst-years the last to learn, that day.682 *Then the path swerved and took a new direction, and they all saw itin the distance, the clearing in the forest, and the sere winter grounds,yellowing dried grass whitened by a few small remnants of snow.The human figures still small at that range. The two spots of dimwhite light from the Aurors’ Patronuses, and the brighter spot of silverlight from the Headmaster’s, next to something…Harry squinted.Something…It must have been purely Harry’s imagination, because there shouldn’thave been any way for a Dementor to reach past three corporeal Patronuses, but he thought he could feel a touch of emptiness brushing athis mind, brushing straight at the soft inner center of himself withoutany respect for Occlumency barriers.Seamus Finnigan was ashen and trembling as he rejoined the studentsmilling about on the withered and snow-spotted grass. Seamus’s Patronus Charm had been successful, but there was still that intervalbetween when the Headmaster dispelled his own Patronus and whenyou were supposed to cast your own, when you faced the Dementor’sfear unshielded.Up to twenty seconds of exposure at five paces was certainly safe, evenfor an eleven-year-old wizard with weak resistance and a still-maturingbrain. There was a lot of variance in how hard the Dementor’s power hitpeople, which was another thing not quite understood; but twenty seconds was definitely safe.Forty seconds of Dementor exposure at five paces might possibly havebeen enough to cause permanent damage, though only to the most sensitive subjects.It was harsh training even by the standards of Hogwarts, where theway you learned to fly on a hippogriff was by being tossed on one andtold to get going. Harry was no fan of overprotectiveness, and if youlooked at the difference in maturity between a fourth-year in Hogwarts683 *and a fourteen-year-old Muggle, it was clear that Muggles were smothering their children… but even Harry had started to wonder if this waspushing it. Not every hurt could be healed afterward.But if you couldn’t cast the spell under those conditions, it meant youcouldn’t rely on using the Patronus Charm to defend yourself; overconfidence was even more dangerous to wizards than to Muggles. Dementorscould drain your magic and your physical vitality, not just your happythoughts, which meant you might not be able to Apparate away if youwaited too long, or if you didn’t recognize the approaching fear until theDementor was within range for its attack. (During his reading, Harry haddiscovered with considerable horror that some books claimed the Dementor’s Kiss would eat your soul and that this was the reason for the permanent mindless coma into which it put the victims. And that wizards whobelieved this had deliberately used the Dementor’s Kiss to execute criminals.It was a certainty that some called criminals were innocent, and even ifthey weren’t, destroying their souls? If Harry had believed in souls, he wouldhave… drawn a blank, he just couldn’t think of an appropriate responseto that.)The Headmaster was taking security seriously, and so were the threeAurors standing guard. Their leader was an Asianish-looking man,solemn without being grim, Auror Komodo, whose wand never left hishand. His Patronus, an orangutan of solid moonlight, paced back andforth between the Dementor and the first-years awaiting their turn;beside the orangutan moved the bright white panther of Auror Butnaru,a man with a piercing gaze, long black hair in a ponytail, and a longbraided goatee. Those two Aurors, and their two Patronuses, were allwatching the Dementor. On the opposite side of the students was theresting Auror Goryanof, tall and thin and pale and unshaven, sittingback on a chair he’d conjured without word or wand, and maintainingan absentminded pokerface as he scanned the entire scene. ProfessorQuirrell had shown up not long after the first-years began their attempts,and his eyes never strayed far from Harry. The tiny Professor Flitwick,who had been a champion duellist, was fiddling absently with his wand;and his eyes, peering out from within the huge puffy beard that served ashis face, stayed focused on Professor Quirrell.684 *And it must have been Harry’s imagination, but Professor Quirrellseemed to wince slightly each time the Headmaster’s Patronus winkedout to test the next student. Maybe Professor Quirrell was imagining thesame placebo effect as Harry, that backwash of emptiness caressing athis mind.“Anthony Goldstein,” called the voice of the Headmaster.Harry quietly walked toward Seamus, even as Anthony began to approach the shining silver phoenix, and… whatever it was beneath the tattered cloak.“What did you see?” Harry asked Seamus in a low voice.A lot of students hadn’t answered Harry, when he’d tried to gatherthe data; but Seamus was Finnigan of Chaos, one of Harry’s lieutenants.Maybe that wasn’t fair, but…“Dead,” said Seamus in a whisper, “grayish and slimy… dead and leftin water for a while… ”Harry nodded. “That’s what a lot of people see,” Harry said. He projected confidence, even though it was fake, because Seamus needed it.“Go eat some chocolate, you’ll feel better.”Seamus nodded and stumbled off toward the table of healing sweets.“Expecto Patronum!” cried a young boy’s voice.Then there were gasps of shock, even from the Aurors.Harry spun around to look—There was a brilliant silver bird standing between Anthony Goldsteinand the cage. The bird reared its head and let out a cry, and the cry wasalso silver, as bright and hard and beautiful as metal.And something in the back of Harry’s mind said, if that’s a peregrinefalcon, I’m going to strangle him in his sleep.Shut up, Harry said to the thought, do you want us to be a Dark Wizard?What’s the point? You’re going to end up as one eventually.That… wasn’t something Harry would usually have thought…It’s a placebo effect, Harry told himself again. The Dementor can’t actuallyget to me through three corporeal Patronuses, I’m just imagining what I think it’slike. When I actually face the Dementor, it’ll feel completely different, and thenI’ll know I was just being silly before.685 *A slight chill went down Harry’s spine then, because he had a feelingthat yes, it would be completely different, and not in a positive direction.The blazing silver phoenix sprang back into existence from the Headmaster’s wand, the lesser bird vanished; and Anthony Goldstein began towalk back.The Headmaster was coming with Anthony instead of calling out thenext name, the Patronus waiting behind to guard the Dementor.Harry glanced over to where Hermione was standing, just behind theglowing panther. Hermione’s turn would have come next, but had apparently just been delayed.She looked stressed.Earlier, she’d politely asked Harry to please stop trying to destress her.Dumbledore was smiling slightly as he escorted Anthony back towardthe others; smiling only slightly, because the Headmaster looked very,very tired.“Unbelievable,” said Dumbledore in a voice that sounded muchweaker than his accustomed boom. “A corporeal Patronus, in his firstyear. And an astounding number of successes among the other youngstudents. Quirinus, I must acknowledge that you have proved yourpoint.”Professor Quirrell inclined his head. “A simple enough guess, I shouldthink. A Dementor attacks through fear, and children are less afraid.”“Less afraid?” said Auror Goryanof from where he was sitting.“So I said as well,” said Dumbledore. “And Professor Quirrell pointedout that adults had more courage, not less to fear; which thought, I confess, had never occurred to me before.”“That was not my precise phrasing,” Professor Quirrell said dryly, “butit will do. And the rest of our agreement, Headmaster?”“As you say,” Dumbledore said reluctantly. “I admit I was not expecting to lose that wager, Quirinus, but you have proven your wisdom.”All the students were looking at them, puzzled; except Hermione, whowas staring in the direction of the cage and the tall decaying robes; andHarry, who was watching everyone, since he was imagining himself feeling paranoid.686 *Professor Quirrell said, in tones that did not invite further comments,“I am allowed to teach the Killing Curse to students who wish to learnit. Which will render them considerably safer from Dark Wizards andother pests, and it is foolish to think they will otherwise know no deadlymagics.” Professor Quirrell paused, his eyes narrowing. “Headmaster, Irespectfully observe that you are not looking well. I suggest leaving theremainder of the day’s task to Professor Flitwick.”Dumbledore shook his head. “We are almost done for the day, Quirinus. I will last.”Hermione had approached Anthony. “Captain Goldstein,” she said,and her voice trembled only a little, “can you give me any advice?”“Don’t be afraid,” Anthony said firmly. “Don’t think about anythingit tries to make you think about. You’re not just holding up the wandin front of you as a shield against the fear, you’re brandishing your wandto drive the fear away, that’s how you make a happy thought into something solid…” Anthony shrugged helplessly. “I mean, I heard all that before, but…”Other students were starting to congregate around Anthony, withtheir own questions.“Miss Granger?” the Headmaster said. His voice might have been gentle, or just weakened.Hermione straightened her shoulders, and followed him.“What did you see under the cloak?” Harry said to Anthony.Anthony looked at Harry, surprised, and then answered, “A very tallman who was dead, I mean, sort of dead-shaped and dead-colored… ithurt to see him and I knew that was the Dementor trying to get at me.”Harry looked back out at where Hermione was confronting the cageand the cloak.Hermione raised her wand into position for the first gestures.The Headmaster’s phoenix winked out of existence.And Hermione gave a tiny, pathetic shriek, flinched——took a step back, Harry could see her wand moving, and then shebrandished it and said “Expecto Patronum!”Nothing happened.Hermione turned and ran.687 *“Expecto Patronum!” said the Headmaster’s deeper voice, and the silverphoenix blazed back to life.The young girl stumbled, and kept running, strange sounds beginning to come from her throat.“Hermione!” Susan yelled it, and Hannah, and Daphne, and Ernie, andthey all started to run toward her; even as Harry, who was always thinking one step ahead, spun on his own heel and ran for the table with thechocolate.Even after Harry had shoved the chocolate into Hermione’s mouthand she’d chewed and swallowed, she was still breathing in great gaspsand crying, her eyes still seemed unfocused.She can’t have been permanently Demented, Harry thought desperately atthe confusion inside him, the horrible fear and deathly fury beginning totwist around each other, she can’t have been, she wasn’t exposed for even tenseconds let alone forty—But she could be temporarily Demented, as Harry realized in that moment, there wasn’t any rule that you couldn’t be temporarily injured by aDementor in just ten seconds if you were sensitive enough.Then Hermione’s eyes seemed to focus, and dart around, and settleon him.“Harry,” she gasped, and the other students went silent. “Harry, don’t.Don’t!”Harry was suddenly afraid to ask what he shouldn’t do, was he in herworst memories, or some sleep’s nightmare that she was now reliving inwaking life?“Don’t go near it!” said Hermione. Her hand reached out, grabbed himby the lapel of his robes. “You mustn’t go near it, Harry! It spoke to me,Harry, it knows you, it knows you’re here!”“What—” Harry said, and then cursed himself for asking.“The Dementor!” said Hermione. Her voice rose to a shriek. “ProfessorQuirrell wants it to eat you!”In the sudden hush, Professor Quirrell came forward a few steps; buthe didn’t approach any closer (Harry was there, after all). “Miss Granger,” he said, and his voice was grave, “I think you should have some morechocolate.”688 *“Professor Flitwick, don’t let Harry try, send him back!”The Headmaster had arrived by then, and he and Professor Flitwickwere exchanging worried looks.“I did not hear the Dementor speak,” the Headmaster said. “Still…”“Just ask,” said Professor Quirrell, sounding a little weary.“Did the Dementor say how it would get to Harry?” said the Headmaster.“All his tastiest parts first,” said Hermione, “it would—it would eat—”Hermione blinked. Some sanity seemed to come back into her eyes.Then she started crying.“You were too brave, Hermione Granger,” the Headmaster said. Hisvoice was gentle, and clearly audible. “Too much braver than I comprehended. You should have turned and run, not endured and tried to complete your Charm. When you are older and stronger, Miss Granger, Iknow that you will try again, and I know that you will succeed.”“I’m sorry,” Hermione said in gasps, “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry…I’m sorry, Harry, I can’t tell you what I saw, I didn’t look at it, I didn’t darelook at it, I knew it was too horrible to ever be seen…”It should have been Harry, but he’d hesitated, because his hands wereall chocolatey; and then Ernie and Susan were there, helping Hermionefrom where she’d fallen on the grass, leading her toward the snacks table.Five bars of chocolate later, Hermione seemed to be all right again,and she went over and apologized to Professor Quirrell; but she was always watching Harry, every time that he glanced in her direction. He’dstepped toward her only once, and stopped when she’d stepped away. Hereyes had silently apologized, and silently pleaded for him to leave her be.Neville Longbottom had seen something dead and half-dissolved, oozingand running with a face like a squashed sponge.It was the worst thing anyone had yet described seeing. Neville hadbeen able to produce a small flicker of light from his wand before, but he689 *had, intelligently and with great presence of mind, turned and run awayinstead of trying to cast his own Patronus Charm.(The Headmaster had said nothing to the other students, told no oneelse to be less brave; but Professor Quirrell had calmly observed that if youmade the mistake after being warned, that was when ignorance becamestupidity.)“Professor Quirrell?” Harry said in a low voice, having come as closeto the Defense Professor as he dared. “What do you see when you—”“Don’t ask.” The voice was very flat.Harry nodded respectfully. “What was your original phrasing to theHeadmaster, if I can ask?”Dryly. “Our worst memories can only grow worse as we grow older.”“Ah,” Harry said. “Logical.”Something strange flickered in Professor Quirrell’s eyes, then, as helooked at Harry. “Let us hope,” Professor Quirrell said, “that you succeedupon this try, Mr. Potter. For if you do, the Headmaster may teach youhis trick of using a Patronus to send messages that cannot be forged or intercepted, and the military importance of that is impossible to overstate.It would be a tremendous advantage to the Chaos Legion, and someday,I suspect, this entire country. But if you do not succeed, Mr. Potter… well,I shall understand.”Morag MacDougal had said, in a wavering voice, “Ouch”, and Dumbledore had recast his Patronus right away.Parvati Patil had produced a corporeal Patronus in the form of a tiger,larger than Dumbledore’s phoenix, though not nearly as bright. Therehad been a great burst of applause from all the watchers, though not thesame shock as when Anthony had done it.And then it was Harry’s turn.The Headmaster called the name of Harry Potter, and Harry wasafraid.Harry knew, he knew that he was going to fail, and he knew that itwas going to hurt.But he still had to try; because sometimes, in the presence of a Dementor, a wizard went from not a flicker of light to a full corporeal Patronus,and no one understood why.And because if Harry couldn’t defend himself from Dementors, he hadto be able to recognize their approach, recognize the feeling of them in hismind, and run before it was too late.What is my worst memory…?Harry had expected the Headmaster to give him a worried look, or ahopeful look, or deeply wise advice; but instead Albus Dumbledore onlywatched him with quiet calm.He thinks I’m going to fail, but he won’t sabotage me by telling me so, thoughtHarry, if he had true words of encouragement to speak, he would speak them…The cage came closer. It was already tarnished, but not rusted awayto nothing, not yet.The cloak came closer. It was unraveling and shot through with unpatched holes; it had been new that morning, Auror Goryanof had said.“Headmaster?” Harry said. “What do you see?”The Headmaster’s voice was also calm. “The Dementors are creaturesof fear, and as your fear of the Dementor diminishes, so does the fearsomeness of its form. I see a tall, thin, naked man. He is not decaying. Heis only slightly painful to look upon. That is all. What do you see, Harry?”…Harry couldn’t see under the cloak.Or that wasn’t right, it was that his mind was refusing to see what wasunder the cloak…No, his mind was trying to see the wrong thing under the cloak, Harrycould feel it, his eyes trying to force a mistake. But Harry had done hisbest to train himself to notice that tiny feeling of confusion, to automatically flinch away from making stuff up; and every time his mind tried tostart inventing a lie about what was under the cloak, that reflex was fastenough to shut it down.Harry looked under the cloak and saw…An open question. Harry wouldn’t let his mind see something false,and so he didn’t see anything, like the part of his visual cortex getting thatsignal was just ceasing to exist. There was a blind spot under the cloak.Harry couldn’t know what was under there.Just that it was far worse than any decaying mummy.The unseeable horror beneath the cloak was very close, now, but theblazing bird of moonlight, the white phoenix, yet lay between them.Harry wanted to run away like some of the other students had. Halfthe ones who’d had no luck with their Patronus Charms just hadn’t shownup today in the first place. Of those remaining, half had fled before theHeadmaster had even dispelled his own Patronus, and no one had said aword. There’d been a little laughter when Terry had turned and walkedback before his own try; and Susan and Hannah, who’d gone before, hadyelled at everyone to shut up.But Harry was the Boy-Who-Lived, and he would lose much respect ifhe was seen to give up without even trying…Pride and roles seemed to diminish and fall away, in the presence ofwhatever lay beneath the cloak.Why am I still here?It wasn’t the shame of others thinking him cowardly, that kept Harry’sfeet in place.It wasn’t the hope of repairing his reputation that brought up hiswand.It wasn’t the desire to master the Patronus Charm as magic, thatmoved his fingers into the initial position.It was something else, something that had to oppose whatever lay beneath the cloak, this was the true darkness and Harry had to find outwhether it lay within him, the power to drive it back.Harry had planned to try one final time to think of his book-shoppingspree with his father, but instead, at the last minute, facing the Dementor,a different memory occurred to him, something he hadn’t tried before; athought that wasn’t warm and happy in the ordinary way, but felt righter,somehow.And Harry remembered the stars, remembered them burning terriblybright and unwavering in the Silent Night; he let that image fill him, fillall of him like an Occlumency barrier across his entire mind, became onceagain the bodiless awareness of the void.The bright silver shining phoenix vanished.And the Dementor smashed into his mind like the fist of God.692 *There was an instant when the two forces clashed head-on, when thepeaceful starlit memory held its own against the fear, even as Harry’s fingers began the wand motions, practiced until they had become automatic.They weren’t warm and happy, those blazing points of light in perfectblackness; but it was an image the Dementor could not easily pierce. Forthe silent burning stars were vast and unafraid, and to shine in the coldand darkness was their natural state.But there was a flaw, a crack, a fault-line in the immovable object trying to resist that irresistible force. Harry felt a twinge of anger at theDementor for trying to feed on him, and it was like slipping on wet ice.Harry’s mind began to slide sideways, into bitterness, black fury, deathlyhatred—Harry’s wand came up in the final brandish.It felt wrong.“Expecto Patronum,” his voice spoke, the words hollow and pointless.And Harry fell into his dark side, fell down into his dark side, furtherand faster and deeper than ever before, down down down as the slideaccelerated, as the Dementor latched onto the exposed and vulnerableparts and fed on them, eating away the light. A fading reflex scrabbledfor warmth, but even as an image of Hermione came to him, or an imageof Mum and Dad, the Dementor twisted it, showed him Hermione lyingdead on the ground, the corpses of his mother and father, and then eventhat was sucked away.Into the vacuum rose the memory, the worst memory, something forgotten so long ago that the neural patterns shouldn’t have still existed.“Lily, take Harry and go! It’s him!” shouted a man’s voice. “Go! Run! I’ll holdhim off!”And Harry couldn’t help but think, in the empty depths of his dark side, howridiculously overconfident James Potter had been. Hold off Lord Voldemort? Withwhat?Then the other voice spoke, high-pitched like the hiss of a teakettle, and it waslike dry ice laid on Harry’s every nerve, like a brand of metal cooled to liquid heliumtemperatures and laid on every part of him. And the voice said:“Avadakedavra.”693 *(The wand flew from the boy’s nerveless fingers as his body began toconvulse and fall, the Headmaster’s eyes widening in alarm as he beganhis own Patronus Charm.)“Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry!” screamed the woman’s voice.Whatever was left of Harry listened with all the light drained out of him, inthe dead void of his heart, and wondered if she thought that Lord Voldemort wouldstop because she asked politely.“Step aside, woman!” said the shrill voice of burning cold. “For you I am notcome, only the boy.”“Not Harry! Please… have mercy… have mercy…”Lily Potter, Harry thought, seemed not to understand what type of people became Dark Lords in the first place; and if this was the best strategy she could conceive to save her child’s life, that was her final failure as a mother.“I give you this rare chance to flee,” said the shrill voice. “But I will not troublemyself to subdue you, and your death here will not save your child. Step aside,foolish woman, if you have any sense in you at all!”“Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead!”The empty thing that was Harry wondered if Lily Potter seriously imaginedthat Lord Voldemort would say yes, kill her, and then depart leaving her son unharmed.“Very well,” said the voice of death, now sounding coldly amused, “I accept thebargain. Yourself to die, and the child to live. Now drop your wand so that I canmurder you.”There was a hideous silence.Lord Voldemort began to laugh, horrible contemptuous laughter.And then, at last, Lily Potter’s voice shrieked in desperate hate, “Avada ke—”The lethal voice finished first, the curse rapid and precise.“Avadakedavra.”A blinding flare of green marked the end of Lily Potter.And the boy in the crib saw it, the eyes, those two crimson eyes, seeming toglow bright red, to blaze like miniature suns, filling Harry’s whole vision as theylocked to his own—694 *The other children saw Harry Potter fall, they heard Harry Potter scream,a thin high-pitched scream that seemed to pierce their ears like knives.There was a brilliant silver flash as the Headmaster bellowed “ExpectoPatronum!” and the blazing phoenix returned to being.But Harry Potter’s horrible scream went on and on and on, even asthe Headmaster scooped up the boy in his arms and bore him away fromthe Dementor, even as Neville Longbottom and Professor Flitwick bothwent for the chocolate at the same time and—Hermione knew it, she knew it as she saw it, she knew that her nightmare had been real, it was coming true, somehow it was coming true.“Get him chocolate!” demanded the voice of Professor Quirrell, pointlessly, because Professor Flitwick’s tiny form was already cannonballingtoward where the Headmaster was racing toward the students.Hermione was moving forward herself, though she didn’t know whatelse she meant to do—“Cast Patronuses!” shouted the Headmaster, as he brought Harry behind the Aurors. “Everyone who can! Get them between Harry and the Dementor! It’s still feeding on him!”There was a moment of frozen horror.“Expecto Patronum!” shouted Professor Flitwick and Auror Goryanof,and then Anthony Goldstein, but he failed the first time, and then Parvati Patil, who succeeded, and then Anthony tried again and his silverbird spread its wings and screamed at the Dementor, and Dean Thomasroared the words like they had been written in letters of fire and his wandgave birth to a towering white bear; there were eight blazing Patronusesall in a line between Harry and the Dementor, and Harry went on screaming and screaming as the Headmaster laid him on the dried grass.Hermione couldn’t cast a Patronus Charm, so she ran toward whereHarry lay. In her mind, something tried to guess how long it had beenalready. Was it twenty seconds? More?There was a dreadful agony and bewilderment on the face of AlbusDumbledore. His long black wand was in his hand, but he spoke no spells,only looked down at Harry’s convulsing body in horror—Hermione didn’t know what to do, she didn’t know what to do, shedidn’t understand what was happening, and the most powerful wizard695 *in the world seemed equally at a loss.“Use your phoenix!” bellowed Professor Quirrell. “Take him far away fromthat Dementor!”Without a single word the Headmaster scooped up Harry in his armsand vanished in a crack of fire along with the suddenly appearing Fawkes;and the Headmaster’s Patronus winked out, where it had guarded theDementor.Horror and confusion and sudden babble.“Mr. Potter should recover,” Professor Quirrell said, raising his voice,but his tone now calm once again, “I think it was just over twenty seconds.”Then the blazing white phoenix appeared again, like it was flying before them from elsewhere, to Hermione Granger came the creature ofmoonlight, and it cried to her in Albus Dumbledore’s voice:“It still feeds on him, even here! How? If you know, Hermione Granger, youmust tell me! Tell me!”The senior Auror turned to stare at her, and so did many students.Professor Flitwick didn’t turn, he was now leveling his wand on ProfessorQuirrell, who was holding out clearly empty hands.Seconds ticked past, uncounted.She couldn’t remember it, she couldn’t remember the nightmareclearly, she couldn’t remember why she had thought it was possible, whyshe had been afraid—Hermione realized then what she ought to do, and it was the hardestdecision of her life.What if whatever had happened to Harry, happened to her too?All her limbs cold as death, her vision gone dark, fear overwhelmingeverything; she’d seen Harry dying, Mum and Dad dying, all her friendsdying, everyone dying, so that in the end, when she died, she would bealone. That was her secret nightmare she’d never talked about with anyone, that had given the Dementor its power over her, the loneliest thingwas to die alone.She didn’t want to go to that place again, she, she didn’t, she didn’twant to stay there forever—696 *You have courage enough for Gryffindor, said the calm voice of the SortingHat in her memory, but you will do what is right in any House I give you. Youwill learn, you will stand by your friends, in any House you choose. So don’t beafraid, Hermione Granger, just decide where you belong…There was no time for deciding, Harry was dying.“I can’t remember now,” said Hermione, her voice cracking, “but justhold on, I’ll go in front of the Dementor again…”She started to run toward the Dementor.“Miss Granger!” squeaked Professor Flitwick, but he made no moveto stop her, only kept holding his wand on Professor Quirrell.“Everyone!” shouted Auror Komodo in a voice of military command.“Get your Patronuses out of her way!”“FLITWICK!” roared Professor Quirrell.Even as Hermione understood, Professor Flitwick was already crying“Accio!”, and she saw the stick of wood zooming up from where it had lainalmost touching the Dementor’s cage.The eyes opened, dead and vacant.“Harry!” gasped a voice in the colorless world. “Harry! Speak to me!”The face of Albus Dumbledore leaned over into the field of vision,which had been occupied by a distant marble ceiling.“You’re annoying,” said the empty voice. “You should die.”697 *awkes,” said Albus Dumbledore, his voice cracking, “help him,please—”A brilliant creature of red-gold shuffled into the field of vision, looking down quizzically; and it began to croon.The meaningless chirps slid off the emptiness, there was nothingonto which they could hold.“You’re noisy,” said the voice, “you should die.”“Chocolate,” Albus Dumbledore said, “you need chocolate, and yourfriends—but I dare not take you back—”Then a shining raven came, and spoke in Professor Flitwick’s voice;whereupon Albus Dumbledore gasped in sudden comprehension, andcursed aloud at his own stupidity.The empty thing laughed at that, for it had retained the capacity to beamused.And a moment later they had all vanished in another flash of fire.It was only a moment, it seemed, between when Flitwick’s raven hadflown to elsewhere, and when Albus Dumbledore reappeared in anothercrack of red and golden fire with Harry in his arms; but somehow in thattime Hermione had already managed to fill her hands with chocolate.Before Hermione even got there, chocolate had zoomed off the tableand straight into Harry’s mouth, which a tiny part of her mind said wasunfair, he’d gotten a chance to do it for her—699 *Harry spat the chocolate back out again.“Go away,” said a voice so empty it wasn’t even cold.…Everything seemed to freeze, everyone who had been moving towardHarry halted, all movements broken by the shock of those two deadwords.Then: “No,” said Albus Dumbledore, “I will not,” and time resumedagain, even as another piece of chocolate zoomed off the table and intoHarry’s mouth.Hermione was close enough now that she could see Harry’s expression become more hateful, as his mouth chewed with a mechanical, unnatural rhythm.The Headmaster’s voice was grim as iron. “Filius, call Minerva, tellher she must come at speed.”Professor Flitwick whispered to his silver raven, and it flew into theair and vanished.Another piece of chocolate floated into Harry’s mouth, and the mechanical chewing continued.There were more students gathering around where the Headmasterwatched over Harry with grim eyes: Neville, Seamus, Dean, Lavender,Ernie, Terry, Anthony, none of them daring to approach any closer thanHermione had.“What can we do?” said Dean in a trembling voice.“Back off and give him more space—” said the dry voice of ProfessorQuirrell.“No!” interrupted the Headmaster. “Let him be surrounded by hisfriends.”Harry swallowed his chocolate, and said in that empty voice, “They’restupid. They should diemmmppphhh” as another piece of chocolate entered his mouth.Hermione saw the looks of shock that crossed their faces.“He doesn’t mean it, does he?” Seamus said it like he was begging.“You don’t understand,” Hermione said, her voice breaking, “that’s notHarry—” and she shut up before she said anything more, but she had tosay that much.She saw from the look on his face that Neville understood, and shealso saw that the others didn’t. If Harry had really never thought anything like that, then being exposed to a Dementor for less than a minutewouldn’t have made him say it. That’s what they were probably thinking.Less than a minute of Dementor exposure couldn’t create a whole newevil person inside you out of nothing.But if that person was already there—Does the Headmaster know?Hermione looked up at the Headmaster, and found that Albus Dumbledore was gazing at her, and that his blue eyes had grown suddenlypiercing—Words came into her mind.Do not speak of it, said the will of Dumbledore to her.You know, thought Hermione. About his dark side.I know. But this is beyond even that. Fawkes’s song cannot reach him, wherehe is lost.What can we—I have a plan, sent the Headmaster. Patience.Something about the tenor of that thought made Hermione nervous.What sort of plan?It is better that you not know, sent the Headmaster.Now Hermione was getting really nervous. She didn’t know how muchthe Headmaster knew about Harry’s dark side—A fair point, sent the Headmaster. I am about to tell you; steel yourself so asnot to react. Are you ready? Good. I am going to pretend to cast the Killing Curseon Professor McGonagall—DO NOT REACT, Hermione!That took work. The Headmaster really was crazy! That wouldn’tbring Harry out of his dark side, Harry would go completely berserk, he’dkill the Headmaster—But that is not true darkness, sent Albus Dumbledore. That is protectiveness, that is love. Fawkes will be able to reach him, then. And when Harry seesthat Minerva is alive after all, it will return him fully.The thought came to Hermione—I doubt that will work, sent the Headmaster, and you may not like the wayhe reacts if you try. But you may try if you wish.She hadn’t really meant that seriously! It was too—Then her eyes moved, breaking gaze with the Headmaster, going tothe boy looking around with empty, despising eyes as his mouth keptchewing and swallowing bar after bar of chocolate without effect. Herheart wrenched, and suddenly a lot of things didn’t seem to matter, onlythat there was a chance.There was a compulsion to chew and swallow chocolate. The response tocompulsion was killing.People had gathered around and stared. That was annoying. The response to annoyance was killing.Other people were chattering in the background. That was insolent.The response to insolence was to inflict pain, but since none of them wereuseful, killing them would be simpler.Killing all those people would be difficult. But many of them didn’ttrust Quirrell, who was strong. Finding exactly the right trigger couldcause them all to kill each other.Then a person leaned over into the field of vision and did something completely strange, something that belonged to a foreign mode ofthought, for which there was only a single response stored anywhere—She heard the gasps around her, and they didn’t matter, she maintainedthe kiss on those chocolate-smeared lips as the tears welled in her eyes.And Harry’s arms came up and pushed her away, and his lips yelled,“I told you, no kissing!”“I think he’ll be all right now,” the Headmaster said, looking at whereHarry was crying in great wretched sobs as Fawkes crooned over him.“Excellently done, Miss Granger. Do you know, not even I would haveexpected that to actually work?”702 *The phoenix’s song wasn’t meant for her, Hermione knew, but shecould still be soothed by it, which she needed, because her life was officially over.703 *awkes’s song gently trailed off into nothing.Harry sat up from where he had lain on the winter-blasted grass,Fawkes still perched on his shoulder.There were intakes of breath from all around him.“Harry,” said Seamus in a wavering voice, “are you all right?”The peace of the phoenix was still in him, and warmth, from whereFawkes perched. Warmth, spreading out through him, and the memory of the song, still alive in the phoenix’s presence. There were terrible things that had happened to him, terrible thoughts that had passedthrough him. He had regained an impossible memory, for all that the Dementor had made him desecrate it. A strange word kept echoing in hismind. And all of that could be put on hold for later, while the phoenix stillshone red and gold beneath the setting sun.Fawkes cawed at him.“Something I have to do?” Harry said to Fawkes. “What?”Fawkes bobbed its head in the direction of the Dementor.Harry looked at the unseeable horror still in its cage, then back at thephoenix, puzzled.“Mr. Potter?” said Minerva McGonagall’s voice from behind him. “Areyou all right?”Harry climbed to his feet and turned.Minerva McGonagall was looking at him, looking very worried; Albus Dumbledore beside her was studying him carefully; Filius Flitwickappeared tremendously relieved; and all the students were just plain staring.705 *“I think so, Professor McGonagall,” Harry said calmly. He’d almostsaid Minerva before managing to stop himself. While Fawkes was on hisshoulder, at least, Harry was fine; it might be that he would collapse amoment after Fawkes left, but somehow thoughts like that didn’t seemimportant. “I think I’m okay.”There ought to have been cheering, or sighs of relief, or something,but no one seemed to know what to say, no one at all.The peace of the phoenix lingered.Harry turned back. “Hermione?” he said.Everyone with the tiniest smidgin of romance in their hearts heldtheir breath.“I don’t really know how to say thank you graciously,” Harry said quietly, “any more than I know how to apologize. All I can say that if you’rewondering whether it was the right thing to do, it was.”The boy and the girl gazed into each other’s eyes.“Sorry,” Harry said. “About what happens next. If there’s anything Ican do—”“No,” Hermione said back. “There isn’t. It’s all right, though.” Thenshe turned from Harry and walked away, toward the path that led backto the gates of Hogwarts.A number of girls gave Harry puzzled looks, and then followed her. Asthey went, you could hear the excited questions starting.Harry looked at them as they left, turned back to look at the other students. They’d seen him on the ground, screaming, and…Fawkes nuzzled his cheek, briefly.…and that would help them, someday, understanding that the BoyWho-Lived could also be hurt, could be wretched. So that when theywere hurt and wretched themselves, they would remember seeing Harrywrithing on the ground, and know that their own pain and troublesdidn’t mean they’d never amount to anything. Had the Headmastercalculated that, when he had let the other students stay and watch?Harry’s eyes went back to the tall tattered cloak, almost absentmindedly, and without really being aware of what he was speaking, Harry said,“It shouldn’t ought to exist.”706 *“Ah,” said a dry, precise voice. “I thought you might say that. I amvery sorry to tell you, Mr. Potter, that Dementors cannot be killed. Manyhave tried.”“Really?” Harry said, still absentmindedly. “What did they try?”“There is a certain extremely dangerous and destructive spell,” Professor Quirrell said, “which I will not name here; a spell of cursed fire. It iswhat you would use to destroy an ancient device such as the Sorting Hat.It has no effect on Dementors. They are undying.”“They are not undying,” said the Headmaster. The words mild, thegaze sharp. “They do not possess eternal life. They are wounds in theworld, and attacking a wound only makes it larger.”“Hm,” Harry said. “Suppose you threw it into the Sun? Would it bedestroyed?”“Throw it into the Sun?” squeaked Professor Flitwick, looking like hewanted to faint.“It seems unlikely, Mr. Potter,” Professor Quirrell said dryly. “The Sunis very large, after all; I doubt the Dementor would have much effect onit. But it is not a test I would like to try, Mr. Potter, just in case.”“I see,” Harry said.Fawkes cawed a final time, mantled his wings around Harry’s head,and then launched himself from Harry. Launched himself straight toward the Dementor, screaming a great piercing cry of defiance thatechoed around the field. And before anyone could react to that, therewas a flash of fire, and Fawkes was gone.The peace faded, a little.The warmth faded, a little.Harry took in a deep breath, let it out again.“Yep,” Harry said. “Still alive.”Again that silence, again the absence of cheering; no one seemed toknow how to respond—“It is good to know you are fully recovered, Mr. Potter,” Professor Quirrell said firmly, as though to deny any other possibility. “Now, I believeMiss Ransom was up next?”That started a bit of an argument, in which Professor Quirrell wasright and everyone else was wrong. The Defense Professor pointed out707 *that, despite the understandable emotions of all concerned, the chance ofa similar mishap occurring to any other student verged on the infinitesimal; the more so as they now knew to avoid mischances with wands. Andmeanwhile, there were other students who needed to take their own bestchance at casting a corporeal Patronus Charm, or else learn the feeling ofa Dementor so they could flee, and discover their own degree of vulnerability…In the end it turned out that Dean Thomas and Ron Weasley of Gryffindor were the only ones left who were still willing to go anywhere nearthe Dementor, which simplified the argument.Harry glanced in the Dementor’s direction. The word echoed in hismind again.All right, Harry thought to himself, if the Dementor is a riddle, what is theanswer?And just like that, it was obvious.Harry looked at the tarnished, slightly corroded cage.He saw what lay beneath the tall, tattered cloak.That was it, then.Professor McGonagall came and spoke to Harry. She hadn’t seen theworst of it, so there was only a slight glitter of water in her eyes. Harrytold her that he needed to talk to her afterward and ask a question he’d putoff for a while, but that didn’t need to happen right now, if she was busy.There was a certain look about her which suggested that she had beenpulled away from something important; and Harry observed this to her,and said that she honestly didn’t need to feel guilty about leaving. Thisearned him something of a sharp look, but then leave she did, hurriedly,with a promise that they would talk later.Dean Thomas cast his white bear again, even in the Dementor’spresence; and Ron Weasley put up an adequate shield of sparkling mist.Which concluded the day, so far as everyone else was concerned, andProfessor Flitwick began to herd the students back to Hogwarts. Whenit was clear that Harry meant to stay behind, Professor Flitwick looked athim quizzically; and Harry, for his part, glanced significantly at Dumbledore. Harry didn’t know what Professor Flitwick made of that, but aftera sharp gaze of warning, his Head of House departed.708 *And so remained only Harry, Professor Quirrell, Headmaster Dumbledore, and an Auror trio.It would have been better to get rid of the trio first, but Harry couldn’tthink of a good way to do that.“All right,” said Auror Komodo, “let’s take it back.”“Excuse me,” Harry said. “I’d like to have another go at the Dementor.”Harry’s request met with a certain amount of opposition of the you’re completely insane variety, though it was only Auror Butnaru who actually saidthat out loud.“Fawkes told me to,” Harry said.This did not overcome all the opposition, despite the look of shock itproduced on Dumbledore’s face. The argument went on, and it was starting to wear the edges off the phoenix’s remaining peace, which annoyedHarry, though only a little.“Look,” Harry said, “I’m pretty sure I know what I was doing wrongbefore. There’s a kind of person who has to use a different sort of warmand happy thought. Just let me try it, okay?”This did not prove persuasive either.“I think,” Professor Quirrell said finally, staring at Harry with narrowed eyes, “that if we do not allow him to do this under supervision, hemay, at some point or another, sneak off and look for a Dementor on hisown. Do I accuse you falsely, Mr. Potter?”There was an appalled pause at this. It seemed like a good time to playhis trump card.“I don’t mind if the Headmaster keeps his own Patronus up,” Harrysaid. For I will be in the presence of a Dementor just the same, Patronus or no.There was confusion at this, even Professor Quirrell looked puzzled;but the Headmaster finally acceded, since it didn’t seem likely that Harrycould be hurt through four Patronuses.If the Dementor could not reach through your Patronus on some level, AlbusDumbledore, you would not see a naked man painful to look upon…709 *Harry didn’t say it out loud, for obvious reasons.And they began to walk toward the Dementor.“Headmaster,” Harry said, “suppose the Ravenclaw door asked youthis riddle: What lies at the center of a Dementor? What would you say?”“Fear,” said the Headmaster.It was a simple enough mistake. The Dementor approached, and thefear came over you. The fear hurt, you felt the fear weakening you, youwanted the fear to go away.It was natural to think the fear was the problem.So they’d concluded that the Dementor was a creature of pure fear,that there was nothing there to fear but fear itself, that the Dementorcouldn’t hurt you if you weren’t afraid…But…What lies at the center of a Dementor?Fear.What is so horrible that the mind refuses to see it?Fear.What is impossible to kill?Fear.…it didn’t quite fit, once you thought about it.Though it was clear enough why people would be reluctant to look beyond the first answer.People understood fear.People knew what they were supposed to do about fear.So, faced with a Dementor, it wouldn’t exactly be comforting to ask:‘What if the fear is just a side effect rather than the main problem?’They had come very close to the Dementor’s cage guarded by four Patronuses, when there came sharp intakes of breath from the three Aurorsand Professor Quirrell. Everyone’s faces turned to look at the Dementor,seeming to listen; there was horror on Auror Goryanof’s face.Then Professor Quirrell raised his head, his face hard, and spat toward the Dementor.“It did not like having its prey taken from it, I suppose,” Dumbledoresaid quietly. “Well. If it becomes necessary, Quirinus, there will alwaysbe a refuge for you at Hogwarts.”“What did it say?” said Harry.Every head swung to stare at him.“You didn’t hear it…?” Dumbledore said.Harry shook his head.“It said to me,” said Professor Quirrell, “that it knew me, and that itwould hunt me down someday, wherever I tried to hide.” His face wasrigid, showing no fright.“Ah,” Harry said. “I wouldn’t worry about that, Professor Quirrell.” It’snot like Dementors can actually talk, or think; the structure they have is borrowedfrom your own mind and expectations…Now everyone was giving him very strange looks. The Aurors wereglancing nervously at each other, at the Dementor, at Harry.And they stood directly before the Dementor’s cage.“They are wounds in the world,” Harry said. “It’s just a wild guess, butI’m guessing the one who said that was Godric Gryffindor.”“Yes…” said Dumbledore. “How did you know?”It is a common misconception, thought Harry, that all the best rationalistsare Sorted into Ravenclaw, leaving none for other Houses. This is not so; beingSorted into Ravenclaw indicates that your strongest virtue is curiosity, wonderingand desiring to know the true answer. And this is not the only virtue a rationalistneeds. Sometimes you have to work hard on a problem, and stick to it for a while.Sometimes you need a clever plan for finding out. And sometimes what you needmore than anything else to see an answer, is the courage to face it…Harry’s gaze went to what lay beneath the cloak, the horror far worsethan any decaying mummy. Rowena Ravenclaw might also have known,for it was an obvious enough riddle once you saw it as a riddle.And it was also obvious why the Patronuses were animals. The animals didn’t know, and so were sheltered from the fear.But Harry knew, and would always know, and would never be able toforget. He’d tried to teach himself to face reality without flinching, andthough Harry had not yet mastered that art, still those grooves had beenworn into his mind, the learned reflex to look toward the painful thoughtinstead of away. Harry would never be able to forget by thinking warmhappy thoughts about something else, and that was why the spell hadn’tworked for him.So Harry would think a warm happy thought that wasn’t about something else.Harry drew forth his wand that Professor Flitwick had returned tohim, put his feet into the beginning stance for the Patronus Charm.Within his mind, Harry discarded the last remnants of the peace ofthe phoenix, put aside the calm, the dreamlike state, remembered insteadFawkes’s piercing cry, and roused himself for battle. Called upon all thepieces and elements of himself to awaken. Raised up within himself allthe strength that the Patronus Charm could ever draw upon, to put himself into the right frame of mind for the final warm and happy thought;remembered all bright things.The books his father had bought him.Mum’s smile when Harry had handmade her a mother’s day card, anelaborate thing that had used half a pound of spare electronics parts fromthe garage to flash lights and beep a little tune, and had taken him threedays to make.Professor McGonagall telling him that his parents had died well, protecting him. As they had.Realizing that Hermione was keeping up with him and even runningfaster, that they could be true rivals and friends.Coaxing Draco out of the darkness, watching him slowly move towardthe light.Neville and Seamus and Lavender and Dean and everyone else wholooked up to him, everyone that he would have fought to protect if anything threatened Hogwarts.Everything that made life worth living.His wand rose into the starting position for the Patronus Charm.Harry thought of the stars, the image that had almost held off the Dementor even without a Patronus. Only this time, Harry added the missing ingredient, he’d never truly seen it but he’d seen the pictures andthe video. The Earth, blazing blue and white with reflected sunlight asit hung in space, amid the black void and the brilliant points of light. Itbelonged there, within that image, because it was what gave everythingelse its meaning. The Earth was what made the stars significant, madethem more than uncontrolled fusion reactions, because it was Earth thatwould someday colonize the galaxy, and fulfill the promise of the nightsky.Would they still be plagued by Dementors, the children’s children’schildren, the distant descendants of humankind as they strode from starto star? No. Of course not. The Dementors were only little nuisances,paling into nothingness in the light of that promise; not unkillable, notinvincible, not even close. You had to put up with little nuisances, if youwere one of the lucky and unlucky few to be born on Earth; on AncientEarth, as it would be remembered someday. That too was part of whatit meant to be alive, if you were one of the tiny handful of sentient beings born into the beginning of all things, before intelligent life had comefully into its power. That the much vaster future depended on what youdid here, now, in the earliest days of dawn, when there was still so muchdarkness to be fought, and temporary nuisances like Dementors.Mum and Dad, Hermione’s friendship and Draco’s journey, Nevilleand Seamus and Lavender and Dean, the blue sky and brilliant Sun andall bright things, the Earth, the stars, the promise, everything humanitywas and everything it would become…On the wand, Harry’s fingers moved into their starting positions; hewas ready, now, to think the right sort of warm and happy thought.And Harry’s eyes stared directly at that which lay beneath the tatteredcloak, looked straight at that which had been named Dementor. The void,the emptiness, the hole in the universe, the absence of color and space,the open drain through which warmth poured out of the world.The fear it exuded stole away all happy thoughts, its closeness drainedyour power and strength, its kiss would destroy everything that you were.I know you now, Harry thought as his wand twitched once, twice, thriceand four times, as his fingers slid exactly the right distances, I comprehendyour nature, you symbolize Death, through some law of magic you are a shadowthat Death casts into the world.And Death is not something I will ever embrace.It is only a childish thing, that the human species has not yet outgrown.And someday…We’ll get over it…And people won’t have to say goodbye any more…The wand rose up and leveled straight at the Dementor.The thought exploded from him like a breaking dam, surged down hisarm into his wand, burst from it as blazing white light. Light that becamecorporeal, took on shape and substance.A figure with two arms, two legs, and a head, standing upright; theanimal Homo sapiens, the shape of a human being.Glowing brighter and brighter as Harry poured all his strength intohis spell, blazing with incandescent light brighter than the fading sunset,the Aurors and Professor Quirrell shielding their eyes in shock—And someday when the descendants of humanity have spread from star to star,they won’t tell the children about the history of Ancient Earth until they’re oldenough to bear it; and when they learn they’ll weep to hear that such a thing asDeath had ever once existed!The figure of a human shone more brilliant now than the noondaySun, so radiant that Harry could feel the warmth of it on his skin; andHarry sent out all his defiance at the shadow of Death, opening all thefloodgates inside him to make that bright shape blaze even brighter andyet brighter.You are not invincible, and someday the human species will end you.I will end you if I can, by the power of mind and magic and science.I won’t cower in fear of Death, not while I have a chance of winning.I won’t let Death touch me, I won’t let Death touch the ones I love.And even if you do end me before I end you,Another will take my place, and another,Until the wound in the world is healed at last…Harry lowered his wand, and the bright figure of a human faded away.Slowly, he exhaled.Like waking up from a dream, like opening his eyes after sleep,Harry’s gaze moved away from the cage, he looked around and saw thateveryone was staring at him.Albus Dumbledore was staring at him.Professor Quirrell was staring at him.The Auror trio was staring at him.They were all looking at him like they’d just seen him destroy a Dementor.The tattered cloak lay empty within the cage.he last tip of the Sun was sinking below the horizon, the red light fading from the treetops, only the blue sky illuminating the six peoplestanding upon the winter-dried and snow-spotted grass, near a vacantcage on whose floor lay an empty, tattered cloak.Harry felt… well, normal again. Sane-ish. The spell hadn’t undone theday and its damage, hadn’t made the injuries as if they had never been,but his hurts had been… bandaged, meliorated? It was hard to describe.Dumbledore was also looking healthier, though not fully restored.The old wizard’s head turned for a moment, locked eyes with ProfessorQuirrell, then looked back to Harry. “Harry,” Dumbledore said, “are youabout to collapse in exhaustion and possibly die?”“No, strangely enough,” Harry said. “That took something out of me,but a lot less than I thought it would.” Or maybe it gave something back,as well as taking… “Honestly, I expected my body to be hitting the groundwith a thud about now.”There was a distinct body-hitting-the-ground-with-a-thuddish sortof sound.“Thank you for taking care of that, Quirinus,” said Dumbledore to Professor Quirrell, who was now standing above and behind the unconsciousforms of the three Aurors. “I confess I am still feeling a bit peaky. ThoughI shall handle the Memory Charms myself.”Professor Quirrell inclined his head, and then looked at Harry. “Iwill omit a good deal of useless incredulity,” said Professor Quirrell, “remarks to the effect that Merlin himself failed to do that, et cetera. Let usgo straight to asking the important question. What the sweet slitheringsnakes was that?”“The Patronus Charm,” Harry said. “Version 2.0.”“I rejoice to see that you are your usual self again,” said Dumbledore.“But you are not going anywhere, young Ravenclaw, until you tell me whatexactly was that warm and happy thought.”“Hm…” said Harry. He tapped a contemplative finger on his cheek. “Iwonder if I should?”Professor Quirrell suddenly grinned.“Please?” said the Headmaster. “Pretty please with sugar on top?”Harry felt an impulse and decided to go with it. It was dangerous, butthere might not ever be a better opportunity until the end of time.“Three sodas,” Harry said to his pouch, then looked up at the DefenseProfessor and the Headmaster of Hogwarts. “Gentlemen,” Harry said, “Ibought these sodas on my first visit to Platform Nine and Three-Quarters,on the day I entered into Hogwarts. I have been saving them for special occasions; there is a minor enchantment on them to ensure they aredrunk at the right time. This is the last of my supply, but I do not thinkthere will ever come a finer occasion. Shall we?”Dumbledore took a soda can from Harry, and Harry tossed anotherto Professor Quirrell. The two older men each muttered identical charmsover the can and frowned briefly at the result. Harry, for his part, simplypopped the top and drank.The Defense Professor and the Headmaster of Hogwarts politely followed suit.Harry said, “I thought of my absolute rejection of death as the naturalorder.”It might not be the right kind of warm feeling you needed to cast aPatronus Charm, but it was going into Harry’s Top 10 nonetheless.The looks he got from the Defense Professor and the Headmasterbriefly made Harry nervous, as the spilled Comed-Tea faded out of existence; but then the two of them each glanced at the other and bothapparently decided that they couldn’t get away with doing anythingreally awful to Harry in the other’s presence.“Mr. Potter,” said Professor Quirrell, “even I know that is not howthings are supposed to work.”“Indeed,” said Dumbledore. “Explain.”Harry opened his mouth, and then, as realization hit him, rapidlysnapped his mouth shut again. Godric hadn’t told anyone, nor hadRowena if she’d known; there might have been any number of wizardswho’d figured it out and kept their mouths shut. You couldn’t forget ifyou knew that was what you were trying to do; once you realized how itworked, the animal form of the Patronus Charm would never work foryou again—and most wizards didn’t have the right upbringing to turnon Dementors and destroy them—“Erm, sorry about this,” said Harry. “But I’ve just this instant realized that explaining would be an incredibly bad idea until you work somethings out on your own.”“Is that the truth, Harry?” Dumbledore said slowly. “Or are you justpretending to be wise—”“Headmaster!” said Professor Quirrell, sounding genuinely shocked.“Mr. Potter has told you that this spell is not spoken of with those whocannot cast it! You do not press a wizard on such matters!”“If I told you—” Harry began.“No,” Professor Quirrell said, sounding rather severe. “You don’t tellus why, Mr. Potter, you simply tell us that we are not to know. If you wishto devise a hint, you do so carefully, at leisure, not in the midst of conversation.”Harry nodded.“But,” said the Headmaster. “But, but what am I to tell the Ministry?You can’t just lose a Dementor!”“Tell them I ate it,” said Professor Quirrell, causing Harry to choke onthe soda he had unthinkingly raised to his lips. “I don’t mind. Shall wehead on back, Mr. Potter?”The two of them began to walk the dirt path back to Hogwarts, leaving behind Albus Dumbledore staring forlornly at the empty cage and thethree sleeping Aurors awaiting their Memory Charms.Aftermath, Harry Potter and Professor Quirrell:They walked for a while before Professor Quirrell spoke, and all background noise dropped into silence when he did.“You are exceptionally good at killing things, my student,” said Professor Quirrell.“Thank you,” Harry said sincerely.“I am not prying,” said Professor Quirrell, “but on the off-chance thatit was only the Headmaster who you did not trust with the secret…?”Harry considered this. Professor Quirrell already couldn’t cast the animal Patronus Charm.But you couldn’t untell a secret, and Harry was a fast enough learnerto realize that he ought to at least think for a while before unleashing thisone upon the world.Harry shook his head, and Professor Quirrell nodded acceptance.“Out of curiosity, Professor Quirrell,” said Harry, “if your bringing theDementor to Hogwarts had been part of an evil plot, what would havebeen its goal?”“Assassinate Dumbledore while he was weakened,” Professor Quirrellsaid without even hesitating. “Hm. The Headmaster told you he was suspicious of me?”Harry said nothing for a second while he tried to think of a reply, andthen gave up when he realized he’d already answered.“Interesting…” Professor Quirrell said. “Mr. Potter, it is not out of thequestion that there was a plot at work today. Your wand ending up thatclose to the Dementor’s cage could have been an accident. Or one of theAurors could have been Imperiused, Confunded, or Legilimized to exertan influence. Flitwick and myself should not be excluded as suspects, inyour calculation. One notes that Professor Snape canceled all his classestoday, and I suspect he is powerful enough to Disillusion himself; the Aurors cast detection charms early on, but they did not repeat them immediately before your turn. But most easily of all, Mr. Potter, the deed couldhave been plotted by Dumbledore himself; and if he did, why, he mightalso take steps in advance to cast your suspicion elsewhere.”They walked on for a few steps.720 *“But why would he?” Harry said.The Defense Professor stayed quiet a moment, and then said,“Mr. Potter, what steps have you taken to investigate the Headmaster’scharacter?”“Not many,” said Harry. He’d only recently realized… “Not nearlyenough.”“Then I will observe,” said Professor Quirrell, “that you do not find outall there is to know about a man by asking only his friends.”Now it was Harry’s turn to walk a few steps in silence on the slightlybeaten dirt path that led back to Hogwarts. He’d really been supposedto know better than that already. Confirmation bias was the technicalterm; it meant, among other things, that when you chose your information sources, there was a notable tendency to choose information sourcesthat agreed with your current opinions.“Thank you,” Harry said. “Actually… I didn’t say it earlier, did I? Thankyou for everything. If another Dementor ever threatens you, or for thatmatter, slightly annoys you, just let me know and I’ll introduce it to MisterGlowy Person. I don’t like it when Dementors slightly annoy my friends.”That got him an indecipherable glance from Professor Quirrell. “Youdestroyed the Dementor because it threatened me?”“Erm,” Harry said, “I’d sort of decided on it before then, but yes, thatwould have been sufficient reason by itself.”“I see,” said Professor Quirrell. “And what would you have done aboutthe threat to me if your spell hadn’t worked for destroying the Dementor?”“Plan B,” said Harry. “Encase the Dementor in dense metal with ahigh melting point, probably tungsten, drop it into an active volcano, andhope it ends up inside Earth’s mantle. Ah, the whole planet is filled withmolten lava under its surface—”“Yes,” said Professor Quirrell. “I know.” The Defense Professor waswearing a very odd smile. “I really should have thought of that myself, allthings considered. Tell me, Mr. Potter, if you wanted to lose somethingwhere no one would ever find it again, where would you put it?”Harry considered this question. “I suppose I shouldn’t ask what you’vefound that needs losing—”“Quite,” said Professor Quirrell, as Harry had expected; and then,“Perhaps you will be told when you are older,” which Harry hadn’t.“Well,” said Harry, “besides trying to get it into the molten core ofthe planet, you could bury it in solid rock a kilometer underground ina randomly selected location—maybe teleport it in, if there’s some wayto do that blindly, or drill a hole and repair the hole afterward; the important thing would be not to leave any traces leading there, so it’s justan anonymous cubic meter somewhere in the Earth’s crust. You coulddrop it into the Mariana Trench, that’s the deepest depth of ocean on theplanet—or just pick some random other ocean trench, to make it less obvious. If you could make it buoyant and invisible, then you could throwit into the stratosphere. Or ideally you would launch it into space, witha cloak against detection, and a randomly fluctuating acceleration factorthat would take it out of the Solar System. And afterward, of course, you’dObliviate yourself, so even you didn’t know exactly where it was.”The Defense Professor was laughing, and it sounded even odder thanhis smile.“Professor Quirrell?” Harry said.“All excellent suggestions,” said Professor Quirrell. “But tell me,Mr. Potter, why those exact five?”“Huh?” said Harry. “They just seemed like the obvious sorts of ideas.”“Oh?” said Professor Quirrell. “But there is an interesting pattern tothem, you see. One might say it sounds like something of a riddle. Imust admit, Mr. Potter, that although it has had its ups and downs, onthe whole, this has been a surprisingly good day.”And they continued walking down the path that led to the gates ofHogwarts, quite some distance apart; as Harry, without even thinkingabout it, automatically stayed far enough away from the Defense Professor not to trigger that sense of doom, which for some reason seemed unusually strong right now.722 *Aftermath, Daphne Greengrass:Hermione had refused to answer any questions, and as soon as they’dpassed the split leading to the Slytherin dungeons, Daphne and Traceyhad peeled off at once, walking as quickly as they could. Rumor traveledfast in Hogwarts, so they’d have to go to the dungeons right away if theywanted to be the first to tell everyone the story.“Now remember,” said Daphne, “don’t just blurt out about the kissas soon as we walk in, okay? It works better if we tell the whole story inorder.”Tracey nodded excitedly.And as soon as they burst into the Slytherin common room, TraceyDavis took a deep breath and shouted, “Everyone! Harry Potter couldn’t castthe Patronus Charm and the Dementor almost ate him and Professor Quirrellsaved him but then Potter was all evil until Granger brought him back with akiss! It’s true love for sure!”It was ordered storytelling of a sort, Daphne supposed.The news failed to produce the expected reaction. Most of the girlsglanced over and then stayed in their couches, or the boys simply keptreading in their chairs.“Yes,” said Pansy sourly, from where she was sitting with Gregory’sfeet in her lap, leaning back and reading what seemed to be a coloringbook, “Millicent already told us.”How—“Why didn’t you kiss him first, Tracey?” said Flora and Hestia Carrowfrom their own chairs. “Now Potter’s going to marry a mudblood girl!You could’ve been his true love and gotten into a rich Noble House andeverything if you’d just kissed him first!”Tracey’s face was a picture in stunned realization.“What?” shrieked Daphne. “Love does not work like that!”“Of course it does,” stated Millicent from where she was practicingsome sort of Charm while looking out a window at the swirling waters ofthe Hogwarts Lake. “First kiss gets the prince.”“It wasn’t their first kiss!” shouted Daphne. “Hermione was already histrue love! That’s why she could bring him back!” Then Daphne realized723 *what she’d just said and winced internally, but as the saying went, youhad to fit the tongue to the ear.“Whoa, whoa, whoa, what?” said Gregory, swinging his feet offPansy’s lap. “What’s this? Miss Bulstrode didn’t tell that part.”Everyone else was also looking at Daphne, now.“Oh, yeah,” said Daphne, “Harry shoved her away and shouted, ‘I toldyou, no kissing!’ Then Harry screamed like he was dying and Fawkesstarted singing to him—I’m not sure which one of those happened first,actually—”“That doesn’t sound like true love to me,” said the Carrow twins. “Thatsounds like the wrong person kissed him.”“It was supposed to be me,” whispered Tracey. Her face was stillstunned. “I was supposed to be his true love. Harry Potter was mygeneral. I should’ve, I should’ve fought Granger for him—”Daphne spun on Tracey, incensed. “You? Take Harry away from Hermione?”“Yeah!” said Tracey. “Me!”“You’re nuts,” Daphne stated with conviction. “Even if you had kissedhim first, you know what that would make you? The sad little lovestruckgirl who dies at the end of Act Two.”“You take that back!” shouted Tracey.Meanwhile, Gregory had crossed the room to where Vincent was doing his homework. “Mr. Crabbe,” Gregory said in a low voice, “I thinkMr. Malfoy needs to know about this.”724 *Aftermath, Hermione Granger:Hermione stared at the wax-sealed paper, on the surface of which wasinscribed simply the number 42.I figured out why we couldn’t cast the Patronus Charm, Hermione, it doesn’thave anything to do with us not being happy enough. But I can’t tell you. I couldn’teven tell the Headmaster. It needs to be even more secret than partial Transfiguration, for now, anyway. But if you ever need to fight Dementors, the secret is writtenhere, cryptically, so that if someone doesn’t know it’s about Dementors and the Patronus Charm, they won’t know what it means…She’d told Harry about seeing him dying, her parents dying, all herfriends dying, everyone dying. She hadn’t told him about her terror ofdying alone, somehow that was still too painful.Harry had told her about remembering his parents dying, and thathe’d thought it was funny.There’s no light in the place the Dementor takes you, Hermione. No warmth.No caring. It’s somewhere that you can’t even understand happiness. There’s pain,and fear, and those can still drive you. You can hate, and take pleasure in destroying what you hate. You can laugh, when you see other people hurting. But youcan’t ever be happy, you can’t even remember what it is that isn’t there anymore…I don’t think there’s any way I can ever explain just what you saved me from. I’musually ashamed to put people to trouble, I usually can’t stand it when people makesacrifices for me, but this one time I’ll say that no matter what it ends up costingyou to have kissed me, don’t ever doubt for a second that it was the right thing todo.Hermione hadn’t realized how little the Dementor had touched her,how small and shallow had been the darkness into which it had taken her.She’d seen everyone dying, and that had still been able to hurt.Hermione put the paper back into her pouch, like a good girl oughtto.She’d really wanted to read it, though.She was frightened of Dementors.725 *Aftermath, Minerva McGonagall:She felt frozen; she shouldn’t have been so shocked, she shouldn’thave found Harry so hard to face, but after what he’d been through… Shehad searched the young boy in front of her for any signs of Dementation,and failed to find them. But something about the calm with which he hadasked such a foreboding question seemed deeply worrying. “Mr. Potter,I can’t possibly speak of such matters without the Headmaster’s permission!”The boy in her office took this in without changing expression. “Iwould prefer not to disturb the Headmaster over this matter,” HarryPotter said calmly. “I insist on not disturbing him, in fact, and you didpromise that our conversation would be kept private. So let me put it thisway. I know that there was, in fact, a prophecy. I know that you are theone who originally heard it from Professor Trelawney. I know that theprophecy identified the child of James and Lily as someone dangerous tothe Dark Lord. And I know who I am, indeed everyone now knows whoI am, so you are revealing nothing new or dangerous, if you tell me onlythis: What was the exact wording which identified me, the child of Jamesand Lily?”Trelawney’s hollow voice echoed in her mind—Born to those who have thrice defied him,born as the seventh month dies…“Harry,” said Professor McGonagall, “I can’t possibly tell you that!” Itchilled her to the bone that Harry knew so much already, she couldn’timagine how Harry had learned—The boy looked at her with strange, sorrowful eyes. “Can you notsneeze without the Headmaster’s permission, Professor McGonagall?For I do promise to you that I have good reason to ask, and good reasonto keep the question private.”“Please don’t, Harry,” she whispered.“All right,” Harry said. “One simple question. Please. Was the Potterfamily mentioned by name? Does the prophecy literally say ‘Potter’?”726 *She stared at Harry for a while. She couldn’t have said why or whereshe got the sense that this was a critical point, that she could not lightlyrefuse the request, nor lightly accede to it—“No,” she finally said. “Please, Harry, don’t ask any more.”The boy smiled, a little sadly it seemed, and said, “Thank you, Minerva.You are a good woman and true.”And while her mouth was still open in utter shock, Harry Potter gotup and left the office; and only then did she realize that Harry had takenher refusal as an answer, and the true answer at that—Harry closed the door behind himself.The logic had presented itself with a strange diamondlike clarity.Harry couldn’t have said if it had come to him during Fawkes’s singing,or maybe even before.Lord Voldemort had killed James Potter. He had preferred to spareLily Potter’s life. He had continued his attack, therefore, with the solepurpose of killing their infant child.Dark Lords were not usually scared of infant children.So there was a prophecy about Harry Potter being dangerous to LordVoldemort, and Lord Voldemort had known that prophecy.“I give you this rare chance to flee. But I will not trouble myself to subdue you,and your death here will not save your child. Step aside, foolish woman, if youhave any sense in you at all!”Had it been a whim, to give her that chance? But then Lord Voldemortwould not have tried to persuade her. Had the prophecy warned LordVoldemort against killing Lily Potter? Then Lord Voldemort would havetroubled himself to subdue her. Lord Voldemort had been mildly inclinednot to kill Lily Potter. The preference had been stronger than a whim, butnot as strong as a warning.So suppose that someone whom Lord Voldemort considered a lesserally or servant, useful but not indispensable, had begged the Dark Lordto spare Lily’s life. Lily’s, but not James’s.This person had known that Lord Voldemort would attack the houseof the Potters. Had known both the prophecy, and the fact that the DarkLord knew it. Otherwise he would not have begged Lily’s life.727 *According to Professor McGonagall, besides herself, the other twowho knew of the prophecy were Albus Dumbledore and Severus Snape.Severus Snape, who had loved Lily before she was Lily Potter, andhated James.Severus, then, had learned of the prophecy, and told it to the DarkLord. Which he had done because the prophecy had not described thePotters by name. It had been a riddle, and Severus had solved that riddleonly too late.But if Severus had been the first to hear the prophecy, and disposed totell it to the Dark Lord, then why would he also have told Dumbledore orProfessor McGonagall?Therefore Dumbledore or Professor McGonagall had heard it first.The Headmaster of Hogwarts had no obvious reason to tell the Transfiguration Professor about an extremely sensitive and crucial prophecy.But the Transfiguration Professor had every reason to tell the Headmaster.It seemed likely, then, that Professor McGonagall had been the firstto hear it.The prior probabilities said that it had been Professor Trelawney,Hogwarts’s resident seer. Seers were rare, so if you counted up most ofthe seconds Professor McGonagall had spent in the presence of a seerover the course of her lifetime, most of those seer-seconds would beTrelawney-seconds.Professor McGonagall had told Dumbledore, and would have told noone else about the prophecy without permission.Therefore, it was Albus Dumbledore who had arranged for SeverusSnape to somehow learn of the prophecy. And Dumbledore himself hadsolved the riddle successfully, or he would not have selected Severus, whohad once loved Lily, as the intermediary.Dumbledore had deliberately arranged for Lord Voldemort to hearabout the prophecy, in hopes of luring him to his death. Perhaps Dumbledore had arranged for Severus to learn only some of the prophecy, orthere were other prophecies of which Severus had remained innocent…somehow Dumbledore had known that an immediate attack on the Potters would still lead to Lord Voldemort’s immediate defeat, although Lord728 *Voldemort himself had not believed this. Or maybe that had just been alucky stroke of Dumbledore’s insanity, his taste for bizarre plots…Severus had ended up serving Dumbledore afterward; perhaps theDeath Eaters would not look kindly on Severus if Dumbledore revealedhis role in their defeat.Dumbledore had tried to arrange for Harry’s mother to be spared. Butthat part of his plot had failed. And he had knowingly condemned JamesPotter to his death.Dumbledore was responsible for the deaths of Harry’s parents. If thewhole chain of logic was correct. Harry could not, in justice, say that successfully ending the Wizarding War did not count as extenuating circumstances. But somehow this still… bothered him a great deal.And it was time and past time to ask Draco Malfoy what the other sideof that war had to say about the character of Albus Percival Wulfric BrianDumbledore.729 *here comes a point in every plot where the victim starts to suspect;and looks back, and sees a trail of events all pointing in a single direction. And when that point comes, Father had explained, the prospectof the loss may seem so unbearable, and admitting themselves trickedmay seem so humiliating, that the victim will yet deny the plot, and thegame may continue long after.Father had warned Draco not to do that again.First, though, he’d let Mr. Avery finish eating all of the cookies he’dswindled from Draco, while Draco watched and cried. The whole lovelyjar of cookies that Father had given him just a few hours earlier, for Dracohad lost all of them to Mr. Avery, down to the very last one.So it was a familiar feeling that Draco had felt in the pit of his stomach,when Gregory told him about The Kiss.Sometimes you looked back, and saw things…(In a lightless classroom—you couldn’t quite call it unused any more,since it’d seen weekly use over the last few months—a boy sat enshroudedin a hooded cowl, with an unlighted crystal globe on the desk in front ofhim. Thinking in silence, thinking in darkness, waiting for an openingdoor to let in the light.)Harry had shoved Granger away and said, I told you, no kissing!Harry would probably say something like, She just did it to annoy me,last time, just like she made me go on that date.But the verified story was that Granger had been willing to face theDementor again in order to help Harry; that she had kissed Harry, crying,when he was lost in the depths of Dementation; and that her kiss hadbrought him back.That didn’t sound like rivalry, even friendly rivalry.That sounded like the kind of friendship you usually didn’t see evenin plays.Then why had Harry made his friend climb the icy walls of Hogwarts?Because that was the sort of thing Harry Potter did to his friends?Father had told Draco that to fathom a strange plot, one techniquewas to look at what ended up happening, assume it was the intended result,and ask who benefited.What had ended up happening as the result of Draco and Grangerfighting Harry Potter together… was that Draco had started to feel a lotfriendlier toward Granger.Who benefited from the scion of Malfoy becoming friends with amudblood witch?Who benefited, that was famous for exactly that sort of plot?Who benefited, that could possibly be pulling Harry Potter’s strings?Dumbledore.And if that was true then Draco would have to go to Father and tell himeverything, no matter what happened after that, Draco couldn’t imaginewhat would happen after that, it was awful beyond imagining. Whichmade him want to cling desperately to the last shred of hope that it wasn’tall what it looked like……Draco remembered that, too, from Mr. Avery’s lesson.Draco hadn’t planned to confront Harry yet. He was still trying tothink of an experimental test, something that Harry wouldn’t just seethrough and fake. But then Vincent had come with the message thatHarry wanted to meet early this week, on Friday instead of Saturday.And so here Draco was, in a dark classroom, an unlit crystal globe onhis desk, waiting.Minutes passed.Footsteps approached.The door made a gentle creak as it swung open into the classroom,revealing Harry Potter dressed in his own hood and cowl; Harry steppedforward into the dark classroom, and the sturdy door closed behind himwith a faint click.732 *Draco tapped the crystal globe, and the classroom lit with brightgreen light. Green light projected shadows of the desks onto the floor,and glared back at him from the curved chair-backs, photons bouncingoff the wood in such fashion that the angle of incidence equaled the angleof reflection.At least that much of what he’d learned wasn’t likely to be a lie.Harry had flinched as the light went on, halting for a moment, thenresumed his approach. “Hello, Draco,” Harry said quietly, drawing backhis hood as he came to Draco’s desk. “Thank you for coming, I know it’snot our usual time—”“You’re welcome,” Draco said flatly.Harry dragged one of the chairs to face Draco across his desk, the legsmaking a slight screeching sound on the floor. He spun the chair so thatit was facing the wrong way, and sat down straddling it, his arms foldedacross the back of the chair. The boy’s face was pensive, frowning, serious,looking very adult even for Harry Potter.“I have an important question to ask you,” said Harry, “but there’ssomething else I want us to do before that.”Draco said nothing, feeling a certain weariness. Part of him justwanted it all to be over with already.“Tell me, Draco,” said Harry. “Why don’t Muggles ever leave ghostsbehind when they die?”“Because Muggles don’t have souls, obviously,” Draco said. He didn’teven realize until after he’d said it that it might contradict Harry’s politics,and then he didn’t care. Besides, it was obvious.Harry’s face showed no surprise. “Before I ask my important question, I want to see if you can learn the Patronus Charm.”For a moment the sheer nonsequitur stumped Draco. Good oldimpossible-to-predict-or-understand Harry Potter. There were timeswhen Draco wondered whether Harry was deliberately this disorientingas a tactic.Then Draco understood, and shoved himself up and away from hisdesk in a single angry motion. That was it. It was over. “Like Dumbledore’sservants,” he spat.“Like Salazar Slytherin,” Harry said steadily.733 *Draco almost stumbled over his own feet in the middle of his firststride toward the door.Slowly, Draco turned back toward Harry.“I don’t know where you came up with that,” said Draco, “but it’swrong, everyone knows the Patronus Charm is a Gryffindor spell—”“Salazar Slytherin could cast a corporeal Patronus Charm,” Harrysaid. Harry’s hand darted into his robes, brought out a book whose titlewas written as white on green, and so almost impossible to read in thegreen light; but it looked old. “I discovered that when I was researchingthe Patronus Charm before. And I found the original reference andchecked the book out of the library just in case you didn’t believe me. Theauthor of this book doesn’t think there’s anything unusual about Salazarbeing able to cast a Patronus, either; the belief that Slytherins can’t dothat must be recent. And as a further historical note, though I don’t havethe book with me, Godric Gryffindor never could.”After the first six times Draco had tried calling Harry’s bluff, on sixsuccessively more ridiculous occasions, he’d realized that Harry justdidn’t lie about what was written in books. Still, when Harry’s handsopened the book and laid it out to the place of a bookmark, Draco leanedover and studied the place where Harry’s finger pointed.Then the fires of Ravenclaw fell upon the darkness that had cloaked the leftwing of Lord Foul’s army, breaking it, and it was revealed that the Lord Gryffindorhad spoken true; the fear they all had felt was not natural in its source, but comingfrom thrice a dozen Dementors, who had been promised the souls of the defeated.At once the Lady Hufflepuff and Lord Slytherin brought forth their Patronuses, avast angry badger and a bright silver serpent, and the defenders lifted their headsas the shadow passed from their hearts. And Lady Ravenclaw laughed, remarkingthat Lord Foul was a great fool, for now his own army would be subject to the fear,but not the defenders of Hogwarts. Yet the Lord Slytherin said, “No fool he, thatmuch I know.” And the Lord Gryffindor beside him studied the battlefield with afrown upon his face…Draco looked back up. “So?”Harry closed the book and put it into his pouch. “Chaos and Sunshineboth have soldiers that can cast corporeal Patronus Charms. Corporeal734 *Patronuses can be used to convey messages. If you can’t learn the spell,Dragon Army will be at a severe military disadvantage—”Draco didn’t care about that right now, and told Harry so. His voicewas sharper than it probably should have been.Harry didn’t blink. “Then I’m calling in the favor you owe me fromthat time I stopped a riot from breaking out, on our first day of broomstick lessons. I’m going to try to teach you the Patronus Charm, and formy favor, I want you to do your honest best to learn and cast it. I trust tothe honor of House Malfoy that you will.”Draco felt that certain weariness again. If Harry had asked at anyother time, it would have been a fair return on favor owed, given thatit wasn’t actually a Gryffindor spell. But…“Why?” Draco said.“To find out whether you can do this thing that Salazar Slytherin coulddo,” Harry said evenly. “This is an experimental test, and I will not tell youwhat it means until after you have done it. Will you?”…It probably was a good idea to discharge that favor on somethinginnocuous, all the more so if it was time to break with Harry Potter. “Allright.”Harry drew a wand from his robes, and laid it against the globe. “Notreally the best color for learning the Patronus Charm,” Harry said. “Greenlight the exact shade of the Killing Curse, I mean. But silver is a Slytherincolor too, isn’t it? Dulak.” The light went out, and Harry whispered thefirst two phrases of the Continual Light enchantment, recasting that partof it, though neither of them could have cast the whole thing by themselves. Then Harry tapped the globe again, and the room lit with a silverradiance, brilliant but still soft and gentle. Color returned to the desksand chairs, and to Harry’s slightly sweaty face beneath his shock of blackhair.It took that long for Draco to realize the implication. “You saw aKilling Curse cast since the last time we met? When—how—”“Cast the Patronus Charm,” Harry said, looking more serious thanever, “and I’ll tell you.”Draco pressed his hands to his eyes, shutting out the silver light. “Youknow, I really should remember that you’re too weird for any normal plots!”735 *Within his self-imposed darkness, he heard the sound of Harrysnickering.Harry watched closely as Draco finished his latest run-through of the preliminary gestures, the part of the spell that was difficult to learn; the finalbrandish and the pronunciation didn’t have to be precise. All three ofthe last runs had been perfect as far as Harry could see. Harry had alsofelt an odd impulse to adjust things that Mr. Lupin hadn’t said anythingabout, like the angle of Draco’s elbow or the direction his foot was pointing; it could have been entirely his own imagination, and probably was,but Harry had decided to go with it just in case.“All right,” Harry said quietly. There was a tension in his chest thatmade it a little hard to speak. “Now we don’t have a Dementor here, butthat’s all right. We won’t need one. Draco, when your father spoke to meat the train station, he said that you were the one thing in the world thatwas most precious to him, and he threatened to throw away all his otherplans to take vengeance on me, if ever you came to harm.”“He… what?” There was a catch in Draco’s voice, and a strange lookon his face. “Why are you telling me that?”“Why wouldn’t I?” Harry didn’t let his expression change, though hecould guess what Draco was thinking; that Harry had been plotting to separate Draco from his father, and shouldn’t be saying anything that wouldbring them closer together. “There’s always been just one person whomatters most to you, and I know exactly what warm and happy thoughtwill let you cast the Patronus Charm. You told it to me at the train stationbefore the first day of school. Once you fell off a broomstick and brokeyour ribs. It hurt more than anything you’d ever felt, and you thoughtyou were going to die. Pretend that fear is coming from a Dementor,standing in front of you, wearing a tattered black cloak, looking like adead thing left in water. And then cast the Patronus Charm, and whenyou brandish the wand to drive the Dementor away, think of how yourfather held your hand, so that you wouldn’t be afraid; and then think ofhow much he loves you, and how much you love him, and put it all into736 *your voice when you say Expecto Patronum. For the honor of House Malfoy, and not just because you promised me a favor. Show me you didn’tlie to me that day in the train station when you told me Lucius was a goodfather. Show me you can do what Salazar Slytherin could do.”And Harry stepped backward, behind Draco, out of Draco’s field of vision, so that Draco only faced the dusty old teacher’s desk and blackboardat the front of the unused classroom.Draco cast one look behind him, that strange look still on his face, andthen turned away to face forward. Harry saw the exhalation, the inhalation. The wand twitched once, twice, thrice, and four times. Draco’s fingers slid along the wand, exactly the right distances—Draco lowered his wand.“This is too—” Draco said, “I can’t think this right, while you’rewatching—”Harry turned around and started walking toward the door. “I’ll comeback in a minute,” Harry said. “Just hold to your happy thought, and thePatronus will stay.”From behind Draco came the sound of the door opening again.Draco heard Harry’s footsteps entering the classroom, but Dracodidn’t turn to look.Harry didn’t say anything either. The silence stretched.Finally—“What does this mean?” Draco said. His voice wavered a bit.“It means you love your father,” Harry’s voice said. Which was justwhat Draco had been thinking, and trying not to cry in front of Harry. Itwas too right, just too right—Before Draco, on the floor, was the shining form of a snake thatDraco recognized; a Blue Krait, a snake first brought to their manor byLord Abraxas Malfoy after a visit to some faraway land, and Father hadkept a Blue Krait in the ophidiarium ever since. The thing about the BlueKrait was that the bite wouldn’t hurt much. Father had said that, andtold Draco that he was never allowed to pet the snake, no matter who was737 *watching. The venom killed your nerves so fast that you didn’t have timeto feel pain as the poison spread. You could die of it even after usingHealing Charms. It ate other snakes. It was as Slytherin as any creaturecould possibly be.That was why a Blue Krait head had been forged into the handle ofFather’s cane.The bright snake darted out its tongue, which was also silver; andseemed to smile somehow, in a warmer way than any reptile should.And then Draco realized—“But,” Draco said, still staring at the beautifully radiant snake, “youcan’t cast the Patronus Charm.” Now that Draco had cast it himself, heunderstood why that was important. You could be evil, like Dumbledore,and still cast the Patronus Charm, so long as you had something bright leftinside you. But if Harry Potter didn’t have a single thought inside himthat shone like that—“The Patronus Charm is more complicated than you think, Draco,”Harry said seriously. “Not everyone who fails at casting it is a bad person, or even unhappy. But anyway, I can cast it. I did it on my second try,after I realized what I’d done wrong facing the Dementor my first time.But, well, my life gets a little peculiar sometimes, and my Patronus cameout strange, and I’m keeping it a secret for now—”“Am I supposed to just believe that?”“You can ask Professor Quirrell if you don’t believe me,” said Harry.“Ask him whether Harry Potter can cast a corporeal Patronus, and tell himthat I told you to ask. He’d know the request was from me, no one elsewould know.”Oh, and now Draco was to trust Professor Quirrell? Still, knowingHarry, it might be true; and Professor Quirrell wouldn’t lie for trivialreasons.The glowing snake turned its head back and forth, as though seekinga prey that wasn’t there, and then coiled itself into a circle, as though torest.“I wonder,” Harry said softly, “when it was, which year, which generation, that Slytherins stopped trying to learn the Patronus Charm. Whenit was that people started to think, that Slytherins themselves started738 *to think, that being cunning and ambitious was the same as being coldand unhappy. And if Salazar knew that his students didn’t even bothershowing up to learn the Patronus Charm any more, I wonder, would hewish that he’d never been born? I wonder how it all went wrong, whenSlytherin’s House went wrong.”The shining creature winked out, the turmoil rising in Draco makingit impossible to sustain the Charm. Draco spun on Harry, he had to control himself not to raise his wand. “What do you know about SlytherinHouse or Salazar Slytherin? You were never Sorted into my House, whatgives you the right to—”And that was when Draco finally realized.“You did get Sorted into Slytherin!” Draco said. “You did, and afterwardsyou, you somehow, you snapped your fingers—” Draco had once asked Father if it would be cleverer to get Sorted into some other House so that everyone would trust him, and Father had smiled and said that he’d thoughtof that too at Draco’s age, but there was no way to fool the Sorting Hat……not until Harry Potter came along.How had he ever bought for one minute that Harry was a Ravenclaw?“An interesting hypothesis,” Harry said equably. “Do you know, you’rethe second person in Hogwarts to come up with a theory along thoselines? At least you’re the second that’s actually said so to my face—”“Snape,” Draco said with certainty. His Head of House was no fool.“Professor Quirrell, of course,” said Harry. “Though come to think,Severus did ask me how I managed to stay out of his House, and whetherI had something the Sorting Hat wanted. I suppose you could say you’renumber three. Oh, but Professor Quirrell’s theory was a little differentthan yours, though. May I have your word not to repeat it?”Draco nodded without even really thinking about it. What was he supposed to do, say no?“Professor Quirrell thought that Dumbledore wasn’t happy with theHat’s choice for the Boy-Who-Lived.”And the instant Harry said it, Draco knew, he knew that it was true, itwas just obvious. Who did Dumbledore even think he was fooling?…well, besides every single other person in Hogwarts except Snapeand Quirrell, Harry might even believe it himself …739 *Draco stumbled back over to his desk in something of a daze, and satdown hard enough to hurt slightly. This sort of thing happened aroundonce a month with Harry, and it hadn’t happened yet in January, so it wastime.His fellow Slytherin, who might or might not think himself a Ravenclaw, sat back down in the chair he’d used earlier, now sitting on it crosswise, and looking up intently at Draco.Draco didn’t know what he should be doing now, whether he shouldbe trying to persuade the lost Slytherin boy that, no, he wasn’t actuallya Ravenclaw… or trying to figure out whether Harry was in league withDumbledore, though that suddenly seemed less likely… but then why hadHarry set up the whole thing with him and Granger…He really should have remembered that Harry was too weird for anynormal plots.“Harry,” Draco said. “Did you deliberately antagonize me and GeneralSunshine just so we’d work together against you?”Harry nodded without hesitation, as though it was the most normalthing in the world, and nothing to be ashamed of.“The whole thing with the gloves and making us climb up the wallsof Hogwarts, the only point was to make me and Granger more friendlytoward each other. And even before then. You’ve been plotting it for areally long time. Since the beginning.”Again the nod.Harry’s eyebrows lifted for a moment, the only reaction he showedto Draco shrieking so loudly in the closed classroom that it hurt his ownears. WHY, WHY, WHY did Harry Potter DO this sort of thing…Then Harry said, “So that Slytherins will be able to cast the PatronusCharm again.”“That… doesn’t… make… SENSE!” Draco was aware that he was losingcontrol of his voice, but he didn’t seem able to stop himself. “What doesthat have to do with Granger?”“Patterns,” Harry said. His face was very serious now, and very grave.“Like a quarter of children born to Squib couples being wizards. A simple,unmistakable pattern you would recognize instantly, if you knew what740 *you were looking at; even though, if you didn’t know, you wouldn’t evenrealize it was a clue. The poison in Slytherin House is something that’sbeen seen before in the Muggle world. This is an advance prediction,Draco, I could have written it down for you before our first day of school,just from hearing you talk in King’s Cross Station. Let me describe somereally pathetic sorts of people that hang around at your father’s politicalrallies, pureblood families that would never be invited to dinner at MalfoyManor. Bearing in mind that I’ve never met them, I’m just predicting itfrom recognizing the pattern of what’s happening to Slytherin House—”And Harry Potter proceeded to describe the Parkinsons and Montagues and Boles with a calmly cutting accuracy that Draco wouldn’thave dared think to himself in case there was a Legilimens around, it wasbeyond insult, they would kill Harry if they ever heard…“To sum up,” Harry finished, “they don’t have any power themselves.They don’t have any wealth themselves. If they didn’t have Mugglebornsto hate, if all the Muggleborns vanished the way they say they want, they’dwake up one morning and find they had nothing. But so long as they cansay purebloods are superior, they can feel superior themselves, they canfeel like part of the master class. Even though your father would neverdream of inviting them to dinner, even though there’s not one Galleon intheir vaults, even if they did worse on their OWLs than the worst Muggleborn in Hogwarts. Even if they can’t cast the Patronus Charm any more.Everything is the Muggleborns’ fault to them, they have someone besidesthemselves to blame for their own failures, and that makes them evenweaker. That’s what Slytherin House is becoming, pathetic, and the rootof the problem is hating Muggleborns.”“Salazar Slytherin himself said that mudbloods needed to be cast out!That they were weakening our blood—” Draco’s voice had risen to a shout.“Salazar was wrong as a question of simple fact! You know that, Draco!And that hatred is poisoning your whole House, you couldn’t cast the Patronus Charm using a thought like that!”“Then why could Salazar Slytherin cast the Patronus Charm?”Harry was wiping sweat from his forehead. “Because things havechanged between then and now! Listen, Draco, three hundred years agoyou could find great scientists, as great as Salazar in their own way, whowould have told you that some other Muggles were inferior because oftheir skin color—”“Skin color?” said Draco.“I know, skin color instead of anything important like blood purity,isn’t it ridiculous? But then something in the world changed, and nowyou can’t find any great scientists who still think skin color should matter, only loser people like the ones I described to you. Salazar Slytherinmade the mistake when everyone else was making it, because he grew upbelieving it, not because he was desperate for someone to hate. There werea few people who did better than everyone else around them, and theywere exceptionally good. But the ones who just accepted what everyoneelse thought weren’t exceptionally evil. The sad fact is that most people justdon’t notice a moral issue at all unless someone else is pointing it out tothem; and once they’re as old as Salazar was when he met Godric, they’velost the ability to change their minds. Only then Hogwarts was built, andHogwarts started sending acceptance letters to Muggleborns like Godricinsisted, and more and more people began to notice that Mugglebornsweren’t any different. Now it’s a big political issue instead of somethingthat everyone just believes without thinking about it. And the correct answer is that Muggleborns aren’t any weaker than purebloods. So now thepeople who end up siding with what Salazar once believed, are either people who grew up in very closed pureblood environments like you, or people who are so pathetic themselves that they’re desperate for someone tofeel superior to, people who love to hate.”“That doesn’t… that doesn’t sound right…” Draco’s voice said. His earslistened, and wondered that he couldn’t come up with anything better tosay.“It doesn’t? Draco, you know now there’s nothing wrong with Hermione Granger. You had trouble dropping her off a roof, I hear. Eventhough you knew she’d taken a Feather-Falling Potion, even though youknew she was safe. What sort of person do you think wants to kill her,not for any wrong she did to them, just because she’s a Muggleborn? Eventhough she’s, she’s just a young girl who would help them with their homework in a second, if they ever asked her,” Harry’s voice broke, “what sortof person wants her to die?”742 *Father—Draco felt split in two, he seemed to be having a problem with dualvision, Granger is a mudblood, she should die and a girl hanging from hishand on the rooftop, like seeing double, seeing double—“And anyone who doesn’t want Hermione Granger to die, won’t wantto hang around the sort of people who do! That’s all people think Slytherinis now, not clever planning, not trying to achieve greatness, just hatingMuggleborns! I paid Morag a Sickle to ask Padma why she hadn’t goneto Slytherin, we both know she got the option. And Morag told me thatPadma just gave her a look and said that she wasn’t Pansy Parkinson. Yousee? The best students with the virtues of more than one House, the students with choices, they go under the Hat thinking anywhere but Slytherin,and someone like Padma ends up in Ravenclaw. And… I think the SortingHat tries to maintain a balance in the Sorting, so it fills out the ranks ofSlytherin with anyone who isn’t repelled by all the hatred. So instead ofPadma Patil, Slytherin gets Pansy Parkinson. She’s not very cunning, andshe’s not very ambitious, but she’s the sort of person who doesn’t mindwhat Slytherin is turning into. And the more Padmas go to Ravenclawand the more Pansies go to Slytherin, the more the process accelerates.It’s destroying Slytherin House, Draco!”It had a ring of awful truth, Padma had belonged in Slytherin… andinstead Slytherin got Pansy… Father rallied lesser families like the Parkinsons because they were convenient sources of support, but Father hadn’trealized the consequences of associating Slytherin’s name with them…“I can’t—” Draco said, but he wasn’t even sure what he couldn’tdo—“What do you want from me?”“I’m not sure how to heal Slytherin House,” Harry said slowly. “ButI know it’s something you and I will end up having to do. It took centuries for science to dawn over the Muggle world, it only happened slowly,but the stronger science got, the further that sort of hatred retreated.”Harry’s voice was quiet, now. “I don’t know exactly why it worked thatway, but that’s how it happened historically. As though there’s somethingin science like the shine of the Patronus Charm, driving back all sorts ofdarkness and madness, not right away, but it seems to follow whereverscience goes. The Enlightenment, that was what it was called in the Mug*743 *gle world. It has something to do with seeking the truth, I think… withbeing able to change your mind from what you grew up believing… withthinking logically, realizing that there’s no reason to hate someone becausetheir skin is a different color, just like there’s no reason to hate HermioneGranger… or maybe there’s something to it that even I don’t understand.But the Enlightenment is something that you and I belong to now, bothof us. Fixing Slytherin House is just one of the things we have to do.”“Let me think,” Draco said, his voice coming out in something of acroak, “please,” and he rested his head in his hands, and thought.Draco thought for a while, with his palms over his eyes to shut out theworld, no sound but his and Harry’s breathing. All the persuasive reasonableness of what Harry said, the evident grains of truth that it contained;and against that, the obvious, the perfectly and entirely obvious hypothesis about what was really going on…After a time, Draco finally raised his head.“It sounds right,” Draco said quietly.A huge smile broke out on Harry’s face.“So,” Draco continued, “is this where you bring me to Dumbledore, tomake it official?”He kept his voice very casual as he said it.“Oh, yeah,” Harry said. “That was the thing I was going to ask youabout, actually—”Draco’s blood froze in his veins, froze solid and shattered—“Professor Quirrell said something to me that got me thinking, and,well, no matter how you answer this question, I’m already stupid for having not asked you a lot earlier. Everyone in Gryffindor thinks Dumbledore is a saint, the Hufflepuffs think he’s crazy, the Ravenclaws are allproud of themselves for having worked out that he’s only pretending tobe crazy, but I never asked anyone in Slytherin. I’m supposed to know744 *better than to make that sort of mistake. But if even you think Dumbledore’s okay to conspire with on fixing Slytherin House, I guess I didn’tmiss anything important.”………“You know,” Draco said, his voice remarkably calm, all things considered, “every time I wonder if you do things like this just to annoy me, Itell myself that it has to be accidental, no one could possibly do this sort ofthing on purpose even if they tried until blood trickled out of their ears.That’s the only reason I’m not going to strangle you now.”“Huh?”And then strangle himself, because Harry had grown up with Muggles, and then Dumbledore had smoothly diverted him from Slytherinto Ravenclaw, so it was perfectly plausible that Harry might not knowanything, and Draco had never thought to tell him.Or else Harry had guessed that Draco wouldn’t join up with Dumbledore so readily, and this itself was just the next step of Dumbledore’splan…But if Harry really didn’t know about Dumbledore, then warning himhad to take precedence over everything.“All right,” Draco said, after he’d had a chance to organize histhoughts. “I don’t know where to start, so I’ll just start somewhere.”Draco drew a deep breath. This was going to take a while. “Dumbledore murdered his little sister, and got away with it because his brotherwouldn’t testify against him—”Harry listened with increasing worry and dismay. Harry had been prepared, he’d thought, to take the blood purist side of the story with a grainof salt. The trouble was that even after you added an enormous amountof salt, it still didn’t sound good.745 *Dumbledore’s father had been convicted of using UnforgivableCurses on children, and died in Azkaban. That was no sin of Dumbledore’s, but it would be a matter of public record. Harry could check thatpart, and see whether all of this had been made up out of thin air by theblood purists.Dumbledore’s mother had died mysteriously, shortly before hisyounger sister died in what the Aurors had ruled to be murder. Supposedly that sister had been brutalized by Muggles and never spoken againafter that; which, Draco pointed out, sounded remarkably like a botchedObliviation.After Harry’s first few interruptions, Draco had seemed to pick up onthe general principle, and was now presenting the observations first andthe inferences afterward.“—so you don’t have to take my word for it,” said Draco, “you can see it,right? Anyone in Slytherin can. Dumbledore waited to fight his duel withGrindelwald until the exact moment when it would look best for Dumbledore, after Grindelwald had ruined most of Europe and built up a reputation as the most terrible Dark Wizard in history, and just when Grindelwald had lost the gold and blood sacrifices he was getting from his Mugglepawns and was about to start heading downhill. If Dumbledore was reallythe noble wizard he pretended to be, he’d have fought Grindelwald longbefore that. Dumbledore probably wanted Europe ruined, it was probablypart of their plan together, he only attacked Grindelwald after his puppet failed him. And that big flashy duel wasn’t real, there’s no way twowizards would be so exactly matched that they’d fight for twenty wholehours until one of them fell over from exhaustion, that was just Dumbledore making it look more spectacular.” Here Draco’s voice became moreindignant. “And that got Dumbledore made Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot! The Line of Merlin Unbroken, corrupted after fifteen hundredyears! And then he became Supreme Mugwump on top of that, and healready had Hogwarts to use as an invincible fortress—Headmaster andChief Warlock and Supreme Mugwump, no normal person would try todo all that at once, how can anyone not see that Dumbledore’s trying to take overthe world?”“Pause,” Harry said, and closed his eyes to think.746 *It wasn’t any worse than what you would have heard about the Westin Stalin’s Russia, and none of that would have been true. Though theblood purists wouldn’t be able to get away with making stuff up entirely…or would they? The Daily Prophet had shown a pronounced tendency tomake stuff up… but then again, when they stuck out their neck too faron the Weasley betrothal, they had been called on it and they had beenembarrassed…Harry opened his eyes, and saw that Draco was watching him with asteady, waiting gaze.“So when you asked me if it was time to join up with Dumbledore, thatwas just a test.”Draco nodded.“And before that, when you said it sounded right—”“It sounds right,” said Draco. “But I don’t know if I can trust you. Areyou going to complain about my testing you, Mr. Potter? Are you going tosay that I fooled you? That I led you on?”Harry knew he should smile like a good sport, but he couldn’t really,it was too much of a disappointment.“You’re right, it’s fair, I can’t complain,” Harry said instead. “So whatabout He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named? Not as bad as he was made out tobe?”Draco looked bitter, at that. “So you think it’s all just making Father’sside look good and Dumbledore’s side look bad, and that I believe it allmyself just because Father told me.”“It’s a possibility I’m considering,” Harry said evenly.Draco’s voice was low and intense. “They knew. My father knew, hisfriends knew. They knew the Dark Lord was evil. But he was the only chanceanyone had against Dumbledore! The only wizard anywhere who was powerful enough to fight him! Some of the other Death Eaters were truly eviltoo, like Bellatrix Black—Father isn’t like that—but Father and his friendshad to do it, Harry, they had to, Dumbledore was taking over everything,the Dark Lord was the only hope anyone had left!”Draco was staring hard at Harry. Harry met the gaze, trying to think.Nobody ever thought of themselves as the villain of their own story—maybe Lord Voldemort did, maybe Bellatrix did, but Draco certainly747 *didn’t. That the Death Eaters were bad guys was not in question. Thequestion was whether they were the bad guys; whether there was onevillain in the story, or two…“You’re not convinced,” Draco said. He looked worried, and a littleangry. Which didn’t surprise Harry. He was pretty sure Draco himselfbelieved all this.“Should I be convinced?” Harry said. He didn’t look away. “Just because you believe it? Are you a strong enough rationalist now that yourbelief is strong evidence to me, because you’d be very unlikely to believeit if it weren’t true? When I met you, you weren’t that strong. Everythingyou told me, did you rethink it after you awakened as a scientist, or is itjust something you grew up believing? Can you look me in the eyes andswear to me upon the honor of House Malfoy that if there’s one untruthburied in what you said, one thing that got added on just to make Dumbledore look a little worse, you would have noticed?”Draco started to open his mouth, and Harry said, “Don’t. Don’t stainthe honor of House Malfoy. You’re not that strong yet, and you shouldknow it. Listen, Draco, I’ve started to notice some worrying things myself.But there’s nothing definite, nothing certain, it’s all just deductions andhypotheses and untrustworthy witnesses… And there’s nothing certainin your story, either. Dumbledore might’ve had some other good reasonnot to fight Grindelwald years earlier—though it would have to be a prettygood excuse, especially considering what was happening on the Muggleside of things… but still. Is there one clearly evil thing that Dumbledore’sdone for certain, so I don’t have to wonder?”Draco’s breathing was harsh. “All right,” Draco said in an unevenvoice, “I’ll tell you what Dumbledore did.” From Draco’s robes came awand, and Draco said “Quietus”, then “Quietus” again, but he got the pronunciation wrong a second time, and finally Harry took out his own wandand did it.“There,” said Draco hoarsely, “once upon a time there, there was agirl, and her name was Narcissa, and she was the prettiest, the smartest,the most cunning girl that was ever Sorted into Slytherin, and my fatherloved her, and they married, and she wasn’t a Death Eater, she wasn’t afighter, all she ever did was love Father—” Draco stopped there, because he748 *was crying.Harry felt sick to his stomach. Draco had never talked about hismother, not once, he should have noticed that earlier. “She… got in theway of a curse?”Draco’s voice came out in a scream. “Dumbledore burned her to death inher own bedroom!”In a classroom filled with soft silver light, one boy is staring at anotherboy, who is sobbing, wiping frantically at his eyes with the sleeves of hisrobes.It was hard for Harry to stay balanced, to keep withholding judgment,it was too emotional, there was something that either wanted to starttears from his own eyes in sympathy with Draco, or know that it wasn’ttrue…Dumbledore burned her to death in her own bedroom!That……didn’t sound like Dumbledore’s style……but you could only think that thought so many times, before youstarted to wonder about the trustworthiness of that whole ‘style’ concept.“It, it must have hurt horribly,” Draco said, his voice shaking, “Fathernever talks about it at all, you don’t ever talk about it in front of him, butMr. Macnair told me, there were scorch marks all over the bedroom, fromhow Mother must have struggled while Dumbledore burned her alive. Thatis the debt Dumbledore owes to House Malfoy and we will have his life forit!”“Draco,” Harry said, he let all of the hoarseness into his own voice, itwould be wrong to sound calm, “I’m sorry, I’m so sorry for asking, but Ihave to know, how do you know it was Dumble—”“Dumbledore said he did it, he told Father it was a warning! AndFather couldn’t testify under Veritaserum because he was an Occlumens,he couldn’t even get Dumbledore put on trial, Father’s own allies didn’tbelieve him after Dumbledore just denied everything in public, but weknow, the Death Eaters know, Father wouldn’t have any reason to lie749 *about that, Father would want us to take revenge on the right person, can’tyou see that Harry?” Draco’s voice was wild.Unless Lucius did it himself, of course, and found it more convenient to blameDumbledore.Although… it also didn’t seem like Lucius’s style. And if he had murdered Narcissa, it would have been smarter to pin the blame on an easier victim instead of losing political capital and credibility by going afterDumbledore…In time, Draco stopped crying, and looked at Harry. “Well?” saidDraco, sounding like he wanted to spit the words. “Is that evil enough foryou, Mr. Potter?”Harry looked down at where his arms rested on the back of his chair.He couldn’t meet Draco’s eyes any more, the pain in them was too raw. “Iwasn’t expecting to hear that,” Harry said softly. “I don’t know what tothink any more.”“You don’t know?” Draco’s voice rose to a shriek, and he stood upabruptly from his desk—“I remembered the Dark Lord killing my parents,” Harry said. “WhenI went in front of the Dementor the first time, that was what I remembered, the worst memory. Even though it was so long ago. I heard themdying. My mother begged the Dark Lord not to kill me, not Harry, please no,take me, kill me instead! That’s what she said. And the Dark Lord mockedher, and laughed. Then, I remember, the flash of green light—”Harry looked up at Draco.“So we could fight,” Harry said, “we could just keep on with the samefight. You could tell me that it was right for my mother to die, becauseshe was the wife of James, who killed a Death Eater. But bad for yourmother to die, because she was innocent. And I could tell you that it wasright for your mother to die, that Dumbledore must have had some reasonthat made it okay to burn her alive in her own bedroom; but bad for mymother to die. But you know, Draco, either way, wouldn’t it be obviousthat we were just being biased? Because the rule that says that it’s wrongto kill innocent people, that rule can’t switch on for my mother and offfor yours, and it can’t switch on for your mother and off for mine. If youtell me that Lily was an enemy of the Death Eaters and it’s right to kill750 *your enemies, then the same rule says that Dumbledore was right to killNarcissa, since she was his enemy.” Harry’s voice went hoarse. “So if thetwo of us are going to agree on anything, it’s going to be that neither oftheir deaths were right and that no one’s mother should die any more.”The fury boiling inside Draco was so great that he could barely stop himself from storming out of the room; all that halted him was the recognition of a critical moment; and a small remnant of friendship, a tiny flashof sympathy, for he had forgotten, he’d forgotten, that Harry’s mother andfather were dead by the Dark Lord’s hand.The silence stretched.“You can talk,” Harry said, “Draco, talk to me, I won’t get angry—areyou thinking, I don’t know, that Narcissa dying was much worse than Lilydying? That it’s wrong for me even to make the comparison?”“I guess I was stupid too,” Draco said. “All this time, all this time Iforgot that you must hate the Death Eaters for killing your parents, hateDeath Eaters the way I hate Dumbledore.” And Harry had never said anything, never reacted when Draco talked about Death Eaters, kept it hidden—Draco was a fool.“No,” Harry said. “It’s not—it’s not like that, Draco, I, I don’t evenknow how to explain to you, except to say that a thought like that,wouldn’t,” Harry’s voice choked, “you wouldn’t ever be able to use it, tocast the Patronus Charm…”Draco felt a sudden wrench in his heart, unwanted but he felt it. “Areyou pretending you’re just going to forget about your own parents? Areyou saying I should just forget about Mother?”“So you and I have to be enemies then?” Now Harry’s voice was growing equally wild. “What have we ever done to each other that means we haveto be enemies? I refuse to be trapped like that! Justice can’t mean thatboth of us should attack each other, it doesn’t make sense!” Harry stopped,took a deep breath, ran his fingers back through the deliberate mess of hishair—the fingers came away sweaty, Draco could see it. “Draco, listen, wecan’t expect to meet on everything right away, you and I. So I won’t askyou to say that the Dark Lord was wrong to kill my mother, just say that itwas… sad. We won’t talk about whether or not it was necessary, whether itwas justified. I’ll just ask you to say that it was sad that it happened, thatmy mother’s life was valuable too, you’ll just say that for now. And I’ll sayit was sad that Narcissa died, because her life was also worth something.We can’t expect to agree on everything right away, but if we start out bysaying that every life is precious, that it’s sad when anyone dies, then Iknow we’ll meet someday. That’s what I want you to say. Not who wasright. Not who was wrong. Just that it was sad when your mother died,and sad when my mother died, and it would be sad if Hermione Grangerdied, every life is precious, can we agree on that and let the rest go by fornow, is it enough if we just agree on that? Can we, Draco? That seems…more like a thought someone could use to cast the Patronus Charm.”There were tears in Harry’s eyes.And Draco was getting angry again. “Dumbledore killed Mother, it’snot enough to just say it’s sad! I don’t understand what you think you haveto do, but the Malfoys have to take revenge!” Not avenging the deathsof family went beyond weakness, beyond dishonor, you might as well notexist.“I’m not arguing with that,” Harry said quietly. “But will you say thatLily Potter’s death was sad? Just say that one thing?”“That’s…” Draco was having difficulty finding words again. “I know,I know how you feel, but don’t you see Harry, even if I just say that LilyPotter’s death was sad, that’s already going against the Death Eaters!”“Draco, you’ve got to be able to say the Death Eaters were wrong aboutsome things! You have to, you can’t progress as a scientist otherwise,there’ll be a roadblock in your way, an authority you can’t contradict. Notevery change is an improvement, but every improvement is a change, youcan’t do anything better unless you can manage to do it differently, you’vegot to let yourself do better than other people! Even your father, Draco, evenhim. You’ve got to be able to point to something your father did and sayit was mistaken, because he wasn’t perfect, and if you can’t say that, youcan’t do better.”Father had warned him, every night before he went to sleep for a752 *month before he went to Hogwarts, that there would be people with thisgoal.“You’re trying to break me loose of Father.”“Trying to break a part of you loose,” said Harry. “Trying to let youfix some things your father got mistaken. Trying to let you do better. Butnot… trying to break your Patronus!” Harry’s voice got softer. “I wouldn’twant to break something bright like that. Who knows, fixing SlytherinHouse might need that, too…”It was getting to Draco, that was the thing, despite everything it wasgetting to him, you had to be really careful around Harry because his arguments sounded so convincing even when he was wrong. “And what you’renot admitting is that Dumbledore told you that you could avenge your parents’ deaths by taking Lord Malfoy’s son from him—”“No. No. That part’s just wrong.” Harry took a deep breath. “I didnot know who Dumbledore was, or who the Dark Lord was, or who theDeath Eaters were, or how my parents died, until three days before I cameto Hogwarts. The day you and I first met in the clothes shop, that wasthe day I learned. And Dumbledore doesn’t even like Muggle science, orhe says he doesn’t, I got a chance to probe him on it once. The thoughtof taking revenge on the Death Eaters through you has never crossed mymind, not even once until now. I didn’t know who the Malfoys were whenI met you in the clothes shop, and then I liked you.”There was a long silence.“I wish I could trust you,” Draco said. His voice was shaking. “If Icould just know you were telling the truth, everything would be so muchsimpler—”And then suddenly it came to Draco.The way to know whether Harry Potter really meant everything hesaid, about wanting to fix Slytherin House, about being sad that Motherhad died.It would be illegal, and since he’d have to do it without Father’s help,it would be dangerous, he couldn’t even trust Harry Potter to help, but…“All right,” Draco said. “I’ve thought of a definitive experiment.”“What is it?”753 *“I want to give you a drop of Veritaserum,” Draco said. “Just one drop,so you can’t lie, but not enough to make you answer anything. I don’t knowwhere I’ll get it, but I’ll make certain it’s safe—”“Um,” Harry said. There was a helpless look on his face. “Draco,um—”“Don’t say it,” Draco said. His voice was firm and calm. “If you say no,that’s my experimental result right there.”“Draco, I’m an Occlumens—”“I was trained by Mr. Bester. Professor Quirrell set it up. Look, Draco,I’ll take one drop of Veritaserum if you can get it, I’m just warning you thatI’m an Occlumens. Not a perfect Occlumens, but Mr. Bester said I wasputting up a complete block, and I could probably beat Veritaserum.”“You’re in your first year at Hogwarts! That’s just crazy!”“Know a Legilimens you can trust? I’ll be happy to demonstrate—look,Draco, I’m sorry, but doesn’t the fact that I told you count for something?I could have just let you do it, you know.”“WHY? Why are you always like this, Harry? Why do you have to mess everything up even when it’s IMPOSSIBLE? And stop smiling, this isn’t funny!”“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I know it’s not funny, I—”It took a while for Draco to get himself under control.But Harry was right. Harry could have just let Draco administer theVeritaserum. If he really was an Occlumens… Draco didn’t know who hecould ask to try Legilimency, but he could at least ask Professor Quirrellif it was true… Could Draco trust Professor Quirrell? Maybe Professor Quirrell would just say anything Harry asked him to.Then Draco remembered the other thing Harry had told him to askProfessor Quirrell, and thought of a different test.“You know,” said Draco. “You know what it costs me, if I agree thatthe poison in Slytherin’s House is hating Muggleborns, and say that LilyPotter’s death was sad. And that’s part of your plan, don’t tell me it’s not.”Harry said nothing, which was wise of him.“There’s something I want from you in return,” said Draco. “And before then, an experimental test I want to try—”754 *Draco pushed open the door to which the portraits had directed them,and this time it was the right door. Before them was a small empty placeof stone set against the night sky. Not a roof like the one he’d droppedHarry from, but a tiny and proper courtyard, far above the ground. Withproper railings, elaborate traceries of stone that flushed seamlessly intothe stone floor… How so much artistry had been infused into the creationof Hogwarts was something that still awed Draco every time he thoughtabout it. There must have been some way to do it all at once, no one couldhave detailed so much piece by piece, the castle changed and every newpiece was like that. It was so far beyond the wizardry of these fadingdays that no one would have believed it if they hadn’t seen the proof inHogwarts itself.Cloudless and cold, the winter night sky; it got dark long before students’ curfew, in the final days of January.The stars shining brightly, in the clear air.Harry had said that being under the stars would help him.Draco touched his chest with his wand, slid his fingers in a practicedmotion, and said, “Thermos.” A warmth spread through him, startingfrom his heart; the wind went on blowing on his face, but he was nolonger cold.“Thermos,” Harry’s voice said behind him.They went together to the railing, to look down at the ground a longway below. Draco tried to figure if they were in one of the towers thatcould be seen from outside, and found that right now he couldn’t quiteseem to picture how Hogwarts looked from outside. But the ground below was always the same; he could see the Forbidden Forest as a vagueoutline, and moonlight glittering from the Hogwarts Lake.“You know,” Harry’s voice said quietly from beside him where hisarms leaned on the railing next to Draco’s, “one of the things that Muggles get really wrong, is that they don’t turn all their lights out at night.Not even for one hour every month, not even for fifteen minutes oncea year. The photons scatter in the atmosphere and wash out all but755 *the brightest stars, and the night sky doesn’t look the same at all, notunless you go far away from any cities. Once you’ve looked up at thesky over Hogwarts, it’s hard to imagine living in a Muggle city, whereyou wouldn’t be able to see the stars. You certainly wouldn’t want tospend your whole life in Muggle cities, once you’d seen the night sky overHogwarts.”Draco glanced at Harry, and found that Harry was craning his neckto stare up at where the Milky Way arched across the darkness.“Of course,” Harry went on, his voice still quiet, “you can’t ever see thestars properly from Earth, either, the air always gets in the way. You haveto look from somewhere else, if you want to see the real thing, the starsburning hard and bright, like their true selves. Have you ever wished thatyou could just whisk yourself up into the night sky, Draco, and go look atwhat there is to see around other Suns than ours? If there were no limitto the power of your magic, is that one of the things you would do, if youcould do anything?”There was a silence, and then Draco realized that he was expected toanswer. “I didn’t think of it before,” Draco said. Without any consciousdecision, his voice came out as soft and hushed as Harry’s. “Do you reallythink anyone would ever be able to do that?”“I don’t think it’ll be that easy,” said Harry. “But I know I don’t meanto spend my whole life on Earth.”It would have been something to laugh at, if Draco hadn’t known thatsome Muggles had already left, without even using magic.“To pass your test,” Harry said, “I’m going to have to say what it meansto me, that thought, the whole thing, not the shorter version I tried to explain to you before. But you should be able to see it’s the same idea, onlymore general. So my version of the thought, Draco, is that when we go outinto the stars, we might find other people there. And if so, they certainlywon’t look like we do. There might be things out there that are grownfrom crystal, or big pulsating blobs… or they might be made of magic,now that I think about it. So with all that strangeness, how do you recognize a person? Not by the shape, not by how many arms or legs it has.Not by the sort of substance it’s made out of, whether that’s flesh or crystal or stuff I can’t imagine. You would have to recognize them as people756 *from their minds. And even their minds wouldn’t work just like ours do.But anything that lives and thinks and knows itself and doesn’t want todie, it’s sad, Draco, it’s sad if that person has to die, because it doesn’twant to. Compared to what might be out there, every human being whoever lived, we’re all like brothers and sisters, you could hardly even tell usapart. The ones out there who met us, they wouldn’t see British or French,they wouldn’t be able to tell the difference, they’d just see a human being.Humans who can love, and hate, and laugh, and cry; and to them, the onesout there, that would make us all as alike as peas in the same pod. Theywould be different, though. Really different. But that wouldn’t stop us,and it wouldn’t stop them, if we both wanted to be friends together.”Harry raised his wand then, and Draco turned, and looked away, ashe had promised; looked toward the stone floor and stone wall in whichthe door was set. For Draco had promised not to look, and not to tell anyone of what Harry had said, or anything at all of what happened here thisnight, though he didn’t know why it was to be so secret.“I have a dream,” said Harry’s voice, “that one day sentient beings willbe judged by the patterns of their minds, and not their color or their shapeor the stuff they’re made of, or who their parents were. Because if wecan get along with crystal things someday, how silly would it be not toget along with Muggleborns, who are shaped like us, and think like us,as alike to us as peas in a pod? The crystal things wouldn’t even be ableto tell the difference. How impossible is it to imagine that the hatred poisoning Slytherin House would be worth taking with us to the stars? Everylife is precious, everything that thinks and knows itself and doesn’t wantto die. Lily Potter’s life was precious, and Narcissa Malfoy’s life was precious, even though it’s too late for them now, it was sad when they died.But there are other lives that are still alive to be fought for. Your life, andmy life, and Hermione Granger’s life, all the lives of Earth, and all the livesbeyond, to be defended and protected, EXPECTO PATRONUM!”And there was light.Everything turned to silver in that light, the stone floor, the stone wall,the door, the railings, so dazzling just in the reflection that you couldhardly even see them, even the air seemed to shine, and the light grewbrighter, and brighter, and brighter—757 *When the light ended it was like a shock, Draco’s hand went automatically to his robe to bring out a handkerchief, and it was only then that herealized he was crying.“There is your experimental result,” Harry’s voice said quietly. “I reallydid mean it, that thought.”Draco slowly turned toward Harry, who had lowered his wand now.“That, that’s got to be a trick, right?” Draco said. He couldn’t takemany more of these shocks. “Your Patronus—can’t really be that bright—”And yet it had been Patronus light, once you knew what you were lookingat, you couldn’t mistake it for anything else.“That was the true form of the Patronus Charm,” Harry said. “Something that lets you put all your strength into the Patronus, without hindrance from within yourself. And before you ask, I did not learn it fromDumbledore. He does not know the secret, and could not cast the trueform if he did. I solved the puzzle for myself. And I knew, once I understood, that this spell must not be spoken of. For your sake, I undertookyour test; but you must not speak of it, Draco.”Draco didn’t know any more, he didn’t know where the true strengthlay, or the right of things. Double vision, double vision. Draco wantedto call Harry’s ideals weakness, Hufflepuff foolishness, the sort of lie thatrulers told to placate the populace and that Harry had been silly enoughto believe for himself, foolishness taken seriously and raised up to insaneheights, projected out onto the stars themselves—Something beautiful and hidden, mysterious and bright—“Will I,” whispered Draco, “be able to cast a Patronus like that, someday?”“If you always keep seeking the truth,” Harry said, “and if you don’trefuse the warm thoughts when you find them, then I’m sure you will. Ithink a person could get anywhere if they just kept going long enough,even to the stars.”Draco wiped his eyes with his handkerchief again.“We should go back inside,” Draco said in an unsteady voice, “someone could’ve seen it, all that light—”Harry nodded, and moved to and through the door; and Draco lookedup at the night sky one last time before he followed.758 *Who was the Boy-Who-Lived, that he was already an Occlumens, andcould cast the true form of the Patronus Charm, and do other strangethings? What was Harry’s Patronus, why must it stay unseen?Draco didn’t ask any of those questions, because Harry might haveanswered, and Draco just couldn’t take any more shocks today. He justcouldn’t. One more shock and his head was going to just fall right offhis shoulders and go bounce, bounce, bounce down the corridors ofHogwarts.They’d ducked into a small alcove, instead of going all the way back to theclassroom, at Draco’s request; he was feeling too nervous to put it off anylonger.Draco put up a Quieting barrier, and then looked at Harry in silentquestion.“I’ve been thinking about it,” Harry said. “I’ll do it, but there are fiveconditions—”“Five?”“Yes, five. Look, Draco, a pledge like this is just begging to go terriblywrong somehow, you know it would go wrong if this were a play—”“Well, it’s not!” Draco said. “Dumbledore killed Mother. He’s evil. It’sone of those things you talk about that doesn’t have to be complicated.”“Draco,” Harry said, his voice careful, “all I know is that you say thatLucius says that Dumbledore says he killed Narcissa. To believe that unquestioningly, I have to trust you and Lucius and Dumbledore. So like Isaid, there are conditions. The first one is that at any point you can release me from the pledge, if it no longer seems like a good idea. It has tobe a deliberate and intended decision on your part, of course, not a trickof wording or something.”“Okay,” said Draco. That sounded safe enough.“Condition two is that I’m pledging to take as an enemy whoever actually did kill Narcissa, as determined to the honest best of my ability as arationalist. Whether that’s Dumbledore, or someone else. And you have759 *my word that I’ll exercise my best ability as a rationalist to keep that judgment honest, as a question of simple fact. Agreed?”“I don’t like it,” said Draco. He didn’t, the whole point was to makesure Harry never went with Dumbledore. Still, if Harry was honest, he’dcatch on to Dumbledore soon enough; and if dishonest, he’d already broken his word… “But I’ll agree.”“Condition three is that Narcissa has to have been burned alive. If thatpart of the story turns out to be something exaggerated just to make itsound a little worse, then I get to decide for myself whether or not to stillgo through with the pledge. Good people sometimes have to kill. But theydon’t ever torture people to death. It’s because Narcissa was burned alivethat I know whoever did that was evil.”Draco kept his temper, barely.“Condition four is that if Narcissa got her own hands dirty, and, say,Crucioed someone’s child into insanity, and that person burned Narcissafor revenge, the deal might be off again. Because then it was still wrongfor them to burn her, they still should’ve just killed her without pain; butit wasn’t evil the same way as if she was just Lucius’s love who never didanything herself, like you said. Condition five is that if whoever killedNarcissa was tricked somehow into doing it, then my enemy is whoevertricked them, not the person who was tricked.”“All this really sounds like you’re planning to weasel out of it—”“Draco, I won’t take a good person as an enemy, not for you or anyone.I have to really believe they’re in the wrong. But I’ve thought about it, andit seems to me that if Narcissa didn’t do any evil with her own hands, justfell in love with Lucius and chose to stay his wife, then whoever burnedher alive in her own bedroom isn’t likely to be a good guy. And I’ll pledgeto take as my enemy whoever made that happen, whether it’s Dumbledore or anyone else, unless you deliberately release me from that pledge.Hopefully that won’t go wrong the way it would if this were a play.”“I’m not happy,” said Draco. “But okay. You pledge to take mymother’s murderer as your enemy, and I’ll—”Harry waited, with a patient look on his face, while Draco tried tomake his voice work again.760 *“I’ll help you fix the problem with Slytherin House hating Muggleborns,” Draco finished in a whisper. “And I’ll say it was sad that Lily Potterdied.”“So be it,” said Harry.And it was done.The break, Draco knew, had just widened a little more. No, not a little,a lot. There was a sensation of drifting away, of being lost, further andfurther from shore, further and further from home…“Excuse me,” Draco said. He turned away from Harry, and then triedto calm himself, he had to do this test, and he didn’t want to fail it frombeing nervous or ashamed.Draco raised his wand into the starting position for the PatronusCharm.Remembered falling from his broomstick, the pain, the fear, imagined it coming from a tall figure in a cloak, looking like a dead thing leftin water.And then Draco closed his eyes, the better to remember Father holding his small, cold hands in his own warm strength.Don’t be frightened, my son, I’m here…The wand swung up in a broad brandish, to drive the fear away, andDraco was surprised at the strength of it; and he remembered in that moment that Father wasn’t lost, would never be lost, would always be thereand strong in his own person, no matter what happened to Draco, andhis voice cried, “Expecto Patronum!”Draco opened his eyes.A shining snake looked back at him, no less bright than before.Behind him, he heard Harry exhale a breath, as though in relief.Draco gazed into the white light. It seemed he wasn’t lost completely,after all.“That reminds me,” said Harry after a while. “Can we test my hypothesis about how to use a Patronus to send messages?”“Is it going to surprise me?” said Draco. “I don’t want any more surprises today.”Harry had claimed that the idea wasn’t all that strange and he didn’t seehow it could possibly shock Draco in any way, which made Draco feel evenmore nervous, somehow; but Draco could see how important it was tohave a way of sending messages in emergencies.The trick—or so Harry hypothesized—was wanting to spread thegood news, wanting the recipient to know the truth of whatever happythought you’d used to cast the Patronus Charm. Only instead of tellingthe recipient in words, the Patronus itself was the message. By wantingthem to see that, the Patronus would go to them.“Tell Harry,” said Draco to the luminous snake, even though Harrywas standing only a few paces away on the other side of the room, “to,um, beware the green monkey,” this being a sign from a play Draco hadonce seen.And then, just like at King’s Cross station, Draco wanted Harry toknow that Father had always cared for him; only this time he didn’t tryto say it in words, but wanted to say it with the happy thought itself.The bright snake slithered across the room, looking more like it wasslithering through the air rather than the stone itself; it got to Harry aftertraveling that short distance——and said to Harry, in a strange voice that Draco recognized as howhe himself probably sounded to other people, “Beware the green monkey.”“Hsssss ssss sshsshssss,” said Harry.The snake slithered back across the floor to Draco.“Harry says the message is received and acknowledged,” said the shining Blue Krait in Draco’s voice.“Huh,” Harry said. “Talking to Patronuses feels odd.”…………“Why are you looking at me like that?” said the Heir of Slytherin.762 *Aftermath:Harry stared at Draco.“You mean just magical snakes, right?”“N-no,” said Draco. He was looking rather pale, and was still stammering, but had at least stopped the incoherent noises he’d been making earlier. “You’re a Parselmouth, you can speak Parseltongue, it’s the languageof all snakes everywhere. You can understand any snake when it talks,and they can understand when you talk to them… Harry, you can’t possibly believe you were Sorted into Ravenclaw! You’re the Heir of Slytherin!”……………763 *t was Saturday, the first morning of February, and at the Ravenclawtable, a boy bearing a breakfast plate heaped high with vegetables wasnervously inspecting his servings for the slightest trace of meat.It might have been an overreaction. After he’d gotten over the rawshock, Harry’s common sense had woken up and hypothesized that“Parseltongue” was probably just a linguistic user interface for controlling snakes……after all, snakes couldn’t really be human-level intelligent, someonewould have noticed by now. The smallest-brained creatures Harry hadever heard of with anything like linguistic ability were the African greyparrots taught by Irene Pepperberg. And that was unstructured protolanguage, in a species that played complex games of adultery and needed tomodel other parrots. While according to what Draco had been able toremember, snakes spoke to Parselmouths in what sounded like normalhuman language—i.e., full-blown recursive syntactical grammar. Thathad taken time for hominids to evolve, with huge brains and strong socialselection pressures. Snakes didn’t have much society at all that Harry hadever heard. And with thousands upon thousands of different species ofsnakes all over the world, how could they all use the same version of theirsupposed language, “Parseltongue”?Of course that was all merely common sense, in which Harry wasstarting to lose faith entirely.But Harry was sure he’d heard snakes hissing on the TV at somepoint—after all, he knew what that sounded like from somewhere—andthat hadn’t sounded to him like language, which had seemed a good dealmore reassuring…765 *…at first. The problem was that Draco had also asserted that Parselmouths could send snakes on extended complex missions. And if thatwas true, then Parselmouths had to make snakes persistently intelligent bytalking to them. In the worst-case scenario that would make the snakeself-aware, like what Harry had accidentally done to the Sorting Hat.And when Harry had offered that hypothesis, Draco had claimed thathe could remember a story—Harry hoped to Cthulhu that this one storywas just a fairy tale, it had that ring to it, but there was a story—aboutSalazar Slytherin sending a brave young viper on a mission to gather information from other snakes.If any snake a Parselmouth had talked to, could make other snakes selfaware by talking to them, then…Then…Harry didn’t even know why his mind was going all “then… then…”when he knew perfectly well how the exponential progression wouldwork, it was just the sheer moral horror of it that was blowing his mind.And what if someone had invented a spell like that to talk to cows?What if there were Poultrymouths?Or for that matter…Harry froze in sudden realization just as the forkful of carrots wasabout to enter his mouth.That couldn’t, couldn’t possibly be true, surely no wizard would be stupidenough to do THAT…And Harry knew, with a dreadful sinking feeling, that of course theywould be that stupid. Salazar Slytherin had probably never consideredthe moral implications of snake intelligence for even one second, justlike it hadn’t ever occurred to Salazar that Muggleborns were intelligentenough to deserve personhood rights. Most people just didn’t see moralissues at all unless someone else was pointing them out…“Harry?” said Terry from beside him, sounding like he was afraid hewould regret asking. “Why are you staring at your fork like that?”“I’m starting to think magic should be illegal,” said Harry. “By theway, have you ever heard any stories about wizards who could speak withplants?”766 *Terry hadn’t heard of anything like that.Neither had any seventh-year Ravenclaws that Harry had asked.And now Harry had returned to his place, but not yet sat down again,staring at his plate of vegetables with a forlorn expression. He was getting hungrier, and later in the day he would be visiting Mary’s Place forone of their incredibly tasty dishes… Harry was finding himself sorelytempted to just revert back to yesterday’s eating habits and be done withit.You’ve got to eat something, said his inner Slytherin. And it’s not all thatmuch more likely that anyone sneezed self-awareness onto poultry than ontoplants, so as long as you’re eating food of questionable sentience either way, whynot eat the delicious deep-fried Diracawl slices?I’m not quite sure that’s valid utilitarian logic, there—Oh, you want utilitarian logic? One serving of utilitarian logic coming up:Even in the unlikely chance that some moron did manage to confer sentience onchickens, it’s your research that stands the best chance of discovering the fact anddoing something about it. If you can complete your work even slightly faster bynot messing around with your diet, then, counterintuitive as it may seem, thebest thing you can do to save the greatest number of possibly-sentient who-knowswhats is not wasting time on wild guesses about what might be intelligent. It’snot like the house elves haven’t prepared the food already, regardless of what youtake onto your plate.Harry considered this for a moment. It was a rather seductive line ofreasoning—Good! said Slytherin. I’m glad you see now that the most moral thing todo is to sacrifice the lives of sentient beings for your own convenience, to feed yourdreadful appetites, for the sick pleasure of ripping them apart with your teeth—What? Harry thought indignantly. Which side are you on here?His inner Slytherin’s mental voice was grim. You too will someday embrace the doctrine… that the end justifies the meats. This was followed by somemental snickering.Ever since Harry had started worrying that plants might also be sentient, his non-Ravenclaw components had been having trouble taking767 *his moral caution seriously. Hufflepuff was shouting Cannibalism! every time Harry tried to think about any food item whatsoever, and Gryffindor would visualize it screaming while he ate it, even if it was, say, asandwich—Cannibalism!Ignore the screams, eat it anyway! It’s a safe place to compromise your ethicsin the service of higher goals, everyone else thinks it’s okay to eat sandwiches soyou can’t use your usual rationalization about a small probability of a large downside if you get caught—Harry gave a mental sigh, and thought, Just so long as you’re okay withus being eaten by giant monsters that didn’t do enough research into whether wewere sentient.I’m okay with that, said Slytherin. Is everyone else okay with that? (Internal mental nods.) Great, can we go back to deep-fried Diracawl slices now?Not until I’ve done some more research into what’s sentient and what isn’t.Now shut up. And Harry turned firmly away from his plate full of oh-sotempting vegetables to head toward the library—Just eat the students, said Hufflepuff. There’s no doubt about whetherthey’re sentient.You know you want to, said Gryffindor. I bet the young ones are the tastiest.Harry was starting to wonder if the Dementor had somehow damaged their imaginary personalities.“Honestly,” said Hermione. The young girl’s voice sounded a little acerbicas her gaze scanned the bookshelves of the Herbology stacks in the Hogwarts library. Harry had left her a message asking if she could come tothe library after she’d finished breakfast, which Harry had skipped; butthen when Harry had introduced the day’s topic she’d seemed a bit nonplussed. “You know your problem, Harry? You’ve got no sense of priorities. An idea gets into your head and you just go running straight off afterit.”768 *“I’ve got a great sense of priorities,” said Harry. His hand reached outand grabbed Vegetable Cunning by Casey McNamara, and began to flipthrough the starting pages, searching for the table of contents. “That’swhy I want to find out whether plants can talk before I eat my carrots.”“Don’t you think that maybe the two of us have more important thingsto worry about?”You sound just like Draco, Harry thought, but of course didn’t say outloud. Out loud he said, “What could possibly be more important thanplants turning out to be sentient?”There was a pregnant silence from beside him, as Harry’s eyes wentdown the table of contents. There was indeed a chapter on Plant Language, causing Harry’s heart to skip a beat; and then his hands began torapidly turn the pages, heading for the appropriate page number.“There are days,” said Hermione Granger, “when I really, truly, haveabsolutely no idea what goes on inside that head of yours.”“Look, it’s a question of multiplication, okay? There’s a lot of plants inthe world, if they’re not sentient then they’re not important, but if plantsare people then they’ve got more moral weight than all the human beingsin the world put together. Now, of course your brain doesn’t realize thaton an intuitive level, but that’s because the brain can’t multiply. Like ifyou ask three separate groups of Canadian households how much they’llpay to save two thousand, twenty thousand, or two hundred thousandbirds from dying in oil ponds, the three groups will respectively statethat they’re willing to pay seventy-eight, eighty-eight, and eighty dollars.No difference, in other words. It’s called scope insensitivity. Your brainimagines a single bird struggling in an oil pond, and that image createssome amount of emotion that determines your willingness to pay. Butno one can visualize even two thousand of anything, so the quantity justgets thrown straight out the window. Now try to correct that bias with respect to a hundred trillion sentient blades of grass, and you’ll realize thatthis could be thousands of times more important than we used to thinkthe whole human species was… oh thank Azathoth, this says it’s just mandrakes that can talk and they speak regular human language out loud, notthat there’s a spell you can use to talk with any plant—”“Ron came to me at breakfast yesterday morning,” Hermione said.769 *Now her voice sounded a little quiet, a little sad, maybe even a little scared.“He said he’d been dreadfully shocked to see me kiss you. That what yousaid while you were Demented should’ve shown me how much evil youwere hiding inside. And that if I was going to be a follower of a Dark Wizard, then he wasn’t sure he wanted to be in my army anymore.”Harry’s hands had stopped turning pages. It seemed that Harry’sbrain, for all its abstract knowledge, was still incapable of appreciatingscope on any real emotional level, because it had just forcibly redirectedhis attention away from trillions of possibly-sentient blades of grass whomight be suffering or dying even as they spoke, and toward the life of asingle human being who happened to be nearer and dearer.“Ron is the world’s most gigantic prat,” Harry said. “They won’t beprinting that in the newspaper anytime soon, because it’s not news. Soafter you fired him, how many of his arms and legs did you break?”“I tried to tell him it wasn’t like that,” Hermione went on in the samequiet voice. “I tried to tell him you weren’t like that, and that it wasn’t likethat between the two of us, but it just seemed to make him even more…more like he was.”“Well, yes,” Harry said. He was surprised that he wasn’t feeling angrier at Captain Weasley, but his concern for Hermione seemed to beoverriding that, for now. “The more you try to justify yourself to peoplelike that, the more it acknowledges that they have the right to questionyou. It shows you think they get to be your inquisitor, and once you grantsomeone that sort of power over you, they just push more and more.” Thiswas one of Draco Malfoy’s lessons which Harry had thought was actuallypretty smart: people who tried to defend themselves got questioned overevery little point and could never satisfy their interrogators; but if youmade it clear from the start that you were a celebrity and above socialconventions, people’s minds wouldn’t bother tracking most violations.“That’s why when Ron came over to me as I was sitting down at the Ravenclaw table, and told me to stay away from you, I held my hand out overthe floor and said, ‘You see how high I’m holding my hand? Your intelligence has to be at least this high to talk to me.’ Then he accused me of,quote, sucking you into the darkness, unquote, so I pursed my lips andwent schluuuuurp, and after that his mouth was still making those talk*770 *ing noises so I put up a Quieting Charm. I don’t think he’ll be trying hislectures on me again.”“I understand why you did that,” Hermione said, her voice tight, “Iwanted to tell him off too, but I really wish you hadn’t, it will make thingsharder for me, Harry!”Harry looked up from Vegetable Cunning again, he wasn’t getting anyreading done at this rate; and he saw that Hermione was still readingwhatever book she had, not looking up at him. Her hands turned anotherpage even as he watched.“I think you’re taking the wrong approach by trying to defend yourselfat all,” Harry said. “I really do think that. You are who you are. You’refriends with whoever you choose. Tell anyone who questions you to shoveit.”Hermione just shook her head, and turned another page.“Option two,” Harry said. “Go to Fred and George and tell them tohave a little talk with their wayward brother, those two are genuine goodguys—”“It’s not just Ron,” Hermione said in almost a whisper. “Lots of peopleare saying it, Harry. Even Mandy is giving me worried looks when shethinks I’m not looking. Isn’t it funny? I keep worrying that ProfessorQuirrell is sucking you into the darkness, and now people are warningme just the same way I try to warn you.”“Well, yeah,” said Harry. “Doesn’t that reassure you a bit about me andProfessor Quirrell?”“In a word,” said Hermione, “no.”There was a silence that lasted long enough for Hermione to turn another page, and then her voice, in a real whisper this time, “And, andPadma is going around telling everyone that, that since I couldn’t castthe P-Patronus Charm, I must only be p-pretending to be n-nice…”“Padma didn’t even try herself!” Harry said indignantly. “If you were aDark Witch who was just pretending, you wouldn’t have tried in front ofeveryone, do they think you’re stupid?”Hermione smiled a little, and blinked a few times.“Hey, I have to worry about actually going evil. Here the worst casescenario is that people think you’re more evil than you really are. Is thatgoing to kill you? I mean, is it all that bad?”The young girl nodded, her face screwed up tight.“Look, Hermione… if you worry that much about what other peoplethink, if you’re unhappy whenever other people don’t picture you exactlythe same way you picture yourself, that’s already dooming yourself to always be unhappy. No one ever thinks of us just the same way we think ofourselves.”“I don’t know how to explain to you,” Hermione said in a sad soft voice.“I’m not sure it’s something you could ever understand, Harry. All I canthink of to say is, how would you feel if I thought you were evil?”“Um…” Harry visualized it. “Yeah, that would hurt. A lot. But you’rea good person who thinks about that sort of thing intelligently, you’veearned that power over me, it would mean something if you thought I’dgone wrong. I can’t think of a single other student, besides you, whoseopinion I’d care about the same way—”“You can live like that,” whispered Hermione Granger. “I can’t.”The girl had gone through another three pages in silence, and Harryhad returned his eyes to his own book and was trying to regain his focus,when Hermione finally said, in a small voice, “Are you really sure I mustn’tknow how to cast the Patronus Charm?”“I…” Harry had to swallow a sudden lump in his throat. He suddenly saw himself not knowing why the Patronus Charm didn’t workfor him, not being able to show Draco, just being told that there was areason, and nothing more. “Hermione, your Patronus would shine withthe same light but it wouldn’t be normal, it wouldn’t look like peoplethink Patronuses should look, anyone who saw it would know there wassomething strange going on. Even if I told you the secret you couldn’tdemonstrate to anyone, unless you made them face the other way so theycould only see the light, and… and the most important part of any secret is the knowledge that a secret exists, you could only show one or twofriends if you swore them to secrecy…” Harry’s voice trailed off helplessly.“I’ll take it.” Her voice was still small.It was very hard not to just blurt out the secret, right there in the library.772 *“I, I shouldn’t, I really shouldn’t, it’s dangerous, Hermione, it could do alot of harm if that secret got out! Haven’t you heard the saying, three cankeep a secret if two are dead? That telling just your closest friends is thesame as telling everyone, because you’re not just trusting them, you’retrusting everyone they trust? It’s too important, too much of a risk, it’snot the sort of decision that should be made for the sake of fixing someone’s reputation at school!”“Okay,” Hermione said. She closed the book and put it back on theshelf. “I can’t concentrate right now, Harry, I’m sorry.”“If there’s anything else I can do—”“Be nicer to everyone.”The girl didn’t look back as she walked out of the stacks, which mighthave been a good thing, because the boy was frozen in place, unmoving.After a while, the boy started turning pages again.773 *boy waits at a small clearing at the edge of the non-forbidden forest,beside a dirt trail that runs back to the gates of Hogwarts in one direction, and off into the distance in another. There is a carriage nearby,and the boy is standing well away from it, looking at it, his eyes seldomwavering from its direction.In the distance, a figure is approaching along the dirt path: A manwearing professorial robes, trudging slowly with his shoulders slumpedlow, his formal shoes kicking up small clouds of dust as he walks.Half a minute later, the boy darts another quick glance before returning to his surveillance; and this glimpse shows that the man’s shouldershave straightened, his face unslackened, and that his shoes are now walking lightly across the dirt, leaving not a trace of dust in the air behind.“Hello, Professor Quirrell,” Harry said without letting his eyes moveagain from the direction of their carriage.“Salutations,” said the calm voice of Professor Quirrell. “You seem tobe keeping your distance, Mr. Potter. I don’t suppose you see somethingodd about our conveyance?”“Odd?” Harry echoed. “Why no, I can’t say I see anything odd. Thereseem to be even numbers of everything. Four seats, four wheels, two hugeskeletal winged horses…”A skin-wrapped skull turned to look at him and flashed teeth, solidand white in that black cavernous mouth, as though to indicate that itwas just about as fond of him as he was of it. The other black leatheryhorse-skeleton tossed its head like it was whickering, but there was nosound.775 *“They are Thestrals, and they have always drawn the carriage,” Professor Quirrell said, sounding quite undisturbed as he climbed into thefront bench of the carriage, sitting down as far to the right as possible.“They are visible only to those who have seen death and comprehended it,a useful defense against most animal predators. Hm. I suppose that thefirst time you went in front of the Dementor, your worst memory provedto be the night of your encounter with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?”Harry nodded grimly. It was the right guess, even if for the wrongreasons. Those who have seen Death…“Did you recall anything of interest, thereby?”“Yes,” Harry said, “I did,” only that and nothing more, for he was notready as yet to make accusations.The Defense Professor smiled one of his dry smiles, and beckonedwith an impatient finger.Harry closed the distance and climbed into the carriage, wincing.The sense of doom had grown significantly stronger after the day of theDementor, even though it had been slowly weakening before then. Thegreatest distance that the carriage allowed him from Professor Quirrellno longer seemed like nearly far enough.Then the skeletal horses trotted forward and the carriage started inmotion, taking them toward the outer bounds of Hogwarts. As it did, Professor Quirrell slumped back down into zombie-mode, and the sense ofdoom retreated, though it still hovered at the edge of Harry’s perceptions,unignorable…The forest scrolled by as the carriage rolled along, the trees movingpast at a speed that seemed positively glacial by comparison to broomsticks or even cars. There was something oddly relaxing, Harry thought,about traveling that slowly. It had certainly relaxed the Defense Professor, who was slumped over with a small stream of drool coming out of hisslack mouth and puddling on his robes.Harry still hadn’t decided what he was allowed to eat for lunch.His library research hadn’t turned up any sign of wizards speakingto nonmagical plants. Or any other nonmagical animals besides snakes,although Spell and Speak by Paul Breedlove had recounted the probablymythical tale of a sorceress called the Lady of Flying Squirrels.776 *What Harry wanted to do was ask Professor Quirrell. The problem wasthat Professor Quirrell was too smart. Judging by what Draco had said,the Heir of Slytherin business was a major bombshell, and Harry wasn’tsure he wanted anyone else to know. And the instant Harry asked aboutParseltongue, Professor Quirrell would fix him with those pale blue eyesand say, ‘I see, Mr. Potter, so you taught Mr. Malfoy the Patronus Charmand accidentally spoke to his snake.’It wouldn’t matter that it shouldn’t be enough evidence to locate thetrue explanation as a hypothesis, let alone overcome its burden of priorimprobability. Somehow the Defense Professor would deduce it anyway.There were times when Harry suspected that Professor Quirrell had waymore background information than he was telling, his priors were simplytoo good. Sometimes he got his amazing deductions right even whenhis reasons were wrong. The problem was that Harry couldn’t see howProfessor Quirrell could’ve snuck in an extra clue about half the stuff heguessed. Just once Harry would have liked to make some sort of incrediblededuction from something Professor Quirrell said which would catch himcompletely off guard.“I shall have a bowl of green lentil soup, with soy sauce,” Professor Quirrellsaid to the waitress. “And for Mr. Potter, a plate of Tenorman’s familychili.”Harry hesitated in sudden dismay. He’d resolved to stick to vegetarian dishes for the moment, but he’d forgotten in his deliberations thatProfessor Quirrell did the actual ordering—and it would be awkward if heprotested now—The waitress bowed to them, and turned to go—“Erm, excuse me, any meat in that from snakes or flying squirrels?”The waitress didn’t so much as blink an eye, only turned back to Harry,shook her head, bowed politely to him again, and resumed her walk toward the door.(The other parts of Harry were snickering at him. Gryffindor wasmaking sardonic comments about how a little social discomfort was777 *enough to get him to resort to Cannibalism! (shouted by Hufflepuff), andSlytherin was remarking on how nice it was that Harry’s ethics were flexible when it came to important goals like maintaining his relationshipwith Professor Quirrell.)After the waitress had closed the door behind her, Professor Quirrellwaved a hand to slide home the locking bar, spoke the usual four Charmsto ensure privacy, and then said, “An interesting question, Mr. Potter. Iwonder why you asked it?”Harry kept his face steady. “I was looking up some facts about thePatronus Charm earlier,” he said. “According to The Patronus Charm: Wizards Who Could and Couldn’t, it turns out that Godric couldn’t and Salazarcould. I was surprised, so I looked up the reference, in Four Lives of Power.And then I discovered that Salazar Slytherin could supposedly talk tosnakes.” (Temporal sequence wasn’t the same as causation, it wasn’tHarry’s fault if Professor Quirrell missed that.) “Further research turnedup an old story about a mother goddess type who could talk to flyingsquirrels. I was a bit worried about the prospect of eating somethingthat could talk.”And Harry took a casual sip of his water——just as Professor Quirrell said, “Mr. Potter, would I be correct inguessing that you are also a Parselmouth?”When Harry was done coughing, he set his glass of water back downon the table, fixed his gaze on Professor Quirrell’s chin rather than looking him in the eyes, and said, “So you are able to perform Legilimencythrough my Occlumency barriers, then.”Professor Quirrell was grinning widely. “I shall take that as a compliment, Mr. Potter, but no.”“I’m not buying this anymore,” Harry said. “There’s no way you cameto that conclusion based on that evidence.”“Of course not,” Professor Quirrell said equably. “I had planned toask you that question today in any case, and simply chose an opportunemoment. I have suspected since December, in fact—”“December?” said Harry. “I found out yesterday!”“Ah, so you did not realize the Sorting Hat’s message to you was inParseltongue?”778 *The Defense Professor had timed it exactly right the second time, too,just as Harry was taking a gulp of water to clear out his throat from thefirst coughing fit.Harry hadn’t realized, not until just now. Of course it was obviousthe instant Professor Quirrell said it. Right, Professor McGonagall hadeven told him not to talk to snakes where anyone could see him, but he’dthought she’d meant not to be seen talking to any statues or architecturalfeatures in Hogwarts that looked like snakes. Double illusion of transparency, he’d thought he understood her, she’d thought he understoodher—but how the hell—“So,” Harry said, “you performed Legilimency on me during my firstDefense class, to find out what happened with the Sorting Hat—”“Then I would not have found out in December.” Professor Quirellleaned back, smiling. “This is not a puzzle you can solve on your own,Mr. Potter, so I will reveal the answer. Over the winter holiday, I wasalerted to the fact that the Headmaster had filed a request for a closed judicial panel to review the case of one Mr. Rubeus Hagrid, whom you knowas the Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts, and who was accused ofthe murder of Abigail Myrtle in 1943.”“Oh, of course,” said Harry, “that makes it downright obvious that I’ma Parselmouth. Professor, what the sweet slithering snakes—”“The other suspect for that murder was Slytherin’s Monster, the legendary inhabitant of Slytherin’s Chamber of Secrets. Which is why certain sources alerted me to the fact, and why it caught my attention sufficiently that I spent a good deal of bribe money to learn the details of thecase. Now in point of fact, Mr. Potter, Mr. Hagrid is innocent. Ridiculously obviously innocent. He is the most blatantly innocent bystanderto be convicted by the magical British legal system since Grindelwald’sConfunding of Neville Chamberlain was pinned on Amanda Knox. Headmaster Dippet prompted a student puppet to accuse Mr. Hagrid becauseDippet needed a scapegoat to take the blame for the death of Miss Myrtle,and our marvelous justice system agreed that this was plausible enoughto warrant Mr. Hagrid’s expulsion and the snapping of his wand. Ourcurrent Headmaster needs merely provide some new item of evidencesignificant enough to reconvene the case; and with Dumbledore apply*779 *ing pressure instead of Dippet, the result is a foregone conclusion. LuciusMalfoy has no particular reason to fear Mr. Hagrid’s vindication; thus Lucius Malfoy will only resist to the extent that he can do so costlessly inorder to impose costs on Dumbledore, and Dumbledore is clearly willingto prosecute the case regardless.”Professor Quirrell took a sip of his water. “But I digress. The newevidence that the Headmaster promises to provide is to exhibit a previously undetected spell on the Sorting Hat, which, the Headmaster asserts,he has personally determined to respond only to Slytherins who are alsoParselmouths. The Headmaster further argues that this favors the interpretation that the Chamber of Secrets was indeed opened in 1943, approximately the right time frame for He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, a knownParselmouth, to have attended Hogwarts. It is a rather questionable logic,but a judicial panel may rule that it swings the case far enough to bringMr. Hagrid’s guilt into doubt, if they can manage to keep a straight faceas they say it. And now we come to the key question: how did the Headmaster discover this hidden spell on the Sorting Hat?”Professor Quirrell was smiling thinly now. “Well now, let us supposethat there was a Parselmouth in this year’s crop of students, a potentialHeir of Slytherin. You must admit, Mr. Potter, that you stand out as a possibility whenever extraordinary people are considered. And if I then further ask myself which new Slytherin would be most likely to have his mental privacy invaded by the Headmaster, specifically hunting the memories of his Sorting, why, you stand out even more.” The smile vanished.“So you see, Mr. Potter, it was not I who invaded your mind, though I willnot ask you to apologize. It is not your fault that you believed Dumbledore’s protestations of respecting your mental privacy.”“My sincere apologies,” Harry said, keeping his face expressionless.The rigid control was a confession in its own right, as was the sweat beading his forehead; but he didn’t think the Defense Professor would takeany evidence from that. Professor Quirrell would just think Harry wasnervous at having been discovered as the Heir of Slytherin. Rather thanbeing nervous that Professor Quirrell might realize that Harry had deliberately betrayed Slytherin’s secret… which itself was no longer seeminglike such a smart move.780 *“So, Mr. Potter. Any progress on finding the Chamber of Secrets?”No, thought Harry. But to maintain plausible deniability, you neededa general policy of sometimes evading questions even when you hadnothing to hide… “With respect, Professor Quirrell, if I had made suchprogress, it is not quite obvious to me that I should tell you about it.”Professor Quirrell sipped from his own waterglass again. “Well then,Mr. Potter, I shall freely tell you what I know or suspect. First, I believethe Chamber of Secrets is real, as is Slytherin’s Monster. Miss Myrtle’sdeath was not discovered until hours after her demise, even though thewards should have alerted the Headmaster instantly. Therefore her murder was performed either by Headmaster Dippet, which is unlikely, or bysome entity which Salazar Slytherin keyed into his wards at a higher levelthan the Headmaster himself. Second, I suspect that contrary to popular legend, the purpose of Slytherin’s Monster was not to rid Hogwarts ofMuggleborns. Unless Slytherin’s Monster were powerful enough to defeat the Headmaster of Hogwarts and all the teachers, it could not triumph by force. Multiple murders in secrecy would result in the school’sclosure, as nearly happened in 1943, or in the placing of new wards. Sowhy Slytherin’s Monster, Mr. Potter? What true purpose does it serve?”“Ah…” Harry dropped his gaze to his waterglass and tried to think. “Tokill anyone who got into the Chamber and didn’t belong there—”“A monster powerful enough to defeat a team of wizards that had broken past the best wards Salazar could place on his Chamber? Unlikely.”Harry was feeling a bit pressured now. “Well, it’s called the Chamberof Secrets, so maybe the Monster has a secret, or is a secret?” For thatmatter, just what sort of secrets were in the Chamber of Secrets in thefirst place? Harry hadn’t done a lot of research on the subject, in partbecause he’d gotten the impression that nobody knew anything—Professor Quirrell was smiling. “Why not just write the secret down?”“Ahhh…” said Harry. “Because if the Monster spoke Parseltongue,that would ensure that only a true descendant of Slytherin could hear thesecret?”“Easy enough to key the wards on the Chamber to a phrase spokenin Parseltongue. Why go to the trouble of creating Slytherin’s Monster?It cannot have been easy to create a creature with a lifespan of centuries.Come, Mr. Potter, it should be obvious; what are the secrets that can betold from one living mind to another, but never written down?”Harry saw it then, with a burst of adrenaline that started his heartracing, his breath coming faster. “Oh.”Salazar Slytherin had been very cunning indeed. Cunning enough tocome up with a way to bypass the Interdict of Merlin.Powerful wizardries couldn’t be transmitted through books or ghosts,but if you could create a long-lived enough sentient creature with a goodenough memory—“It seems very probable to me,” said Professor Quirrell, “that HeWho-Must-Not-Be-Named began his climb to power with secrets obtained from Slytherin’s Monster. That Salazar’s lost knowledge is thesource of You-Know-Who’s extraordinarily powerful wizardry. Hencemy interest in the Chamber of Secrets and the case of Mr. Hagrid.”“I see,” Harry said. And if he, Harry, could find Salazar’s Chamber ofSecrets… then all of the lost knowledge that Lord Voldemort had obtainedwould be his as well.Yes. That was just how the story should go.Add in Harry’s superior intelligence and some original magical research and some Muggle rocket launchers, and the resulting fight wouldbe completely one-sided, which was exactly how Harry wanted it.Harry was grinning now, a very evil grin. New priority: Find everythingin Hogwarts that looks remotely like a snake and try speaking to it. Starting witheverything you’ve already tried, only this time be sure to use Parseltongue insteadof English—get Draco to let you into the Slytherin dorms—“Don’t become too excited, Mr. Potter,” said Professor Quirrell. Hisown face had become expressionless, now. “You must continue thinking.What were the Dark Lord’s parting words to Slytherin’s Monster?”“What?” Harry said. “How could either of us possibly know that?”“Visualize the scene, Mr. Potter. Let your imagination fill in thedetails. Slytherin’s Monster—probably some great serpent, so that onlya Parselmouth may speak to it—has finished imparting all of the knowledge it possesses to He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. It conveys to himSalazar’s final benediction, and warns him that the Chamber of Secretsmust now remain closed until the next descendant of Salazar should782 *prove cunning enough to open it. And he who will become the Dark Lordnods, and says to it—”“Avada Kedavra,” said Harry, suddenly feeling sick to his stomach.“Rule Twelve,” Professor Quirrell said quietly. “Never leave the sourceof your power lying around where someone else can find it.”Harry’s gaze dropped to the tablecloth, which had decorated itself in amournful pattern of black flowers and shadows. Somehow that seemed…too sad to be imagined, Slytherin’s great snake had only wanted to helpLord Voldemort, and Lord Voldemort had just… there was something unbearably sorrowful about it, what sort of person would do that to a beingwho’d offered them nothing but friendship… “Do you think the Dark Lordwould have—”“Yes,” Professor Quirrell said flatly. “He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Namedleft quite a trail of bodies behind him, Mr. Potter; I doubt he would haveomitted that one. If there were any artifacts left there that could bemoved, the Dark Lord would have taken those with him as well. Theremight still be something worth seeing in the Chamber of Secrets, and tofind it would prove yourself the true Heir of Slytherin. But do not raiseyour hopes too high. I suspect that all you will find is the remains ofSlytherin’s Monster resting quietly in its grave.”They sat in silence for a while.“I could be wrong,” said Professor Quirrell. “In the end it is only aguess. But I did wish to warn you, Mr. Potter, so that you would not betoo sorely disappointed.”Harry nodded shortly.“One might even regret your infant self’s victory,” said Professor Quirrell. His smile twisted. “If only You-Know-Who had lived, you mighthave persuaded him to teach you some of the knowledge that would havebeen your heritage, from one Heir of Slytherin to another.” The smiletwisted further, as though to mock the obvious impossibility, even giventhe premise.Note to self, thought Harry, with a slight chill and an edge of anger,make sure to extract my heritage out of the Dark Lord’s mind, one way or another.There was another silence. Professor Quirrell was looking at Harry asthough waiting for him to ask something.783 *“Well,” said Harry, “so long as we’re on the topic, can I ask how youthink the whole Parselmouth business actually—”There came a knock at the door, then. Professor Quirrell raised a cautionary finger, then opened the door with a wave. The waitress entered,balancing a huge platter with their meals as though the whole assemblyweighed nothing (which was in fact probably the case). She gave Professor Quirrell his bowl of green soup, and a glass of his usual Chianti;and set down before Harry a plate of small meat strips smothered in aheavy-looking sauce, plus a glass of his accustomed treacle soda. Thenshe bowed, managing to make it seem like sincere respect rather thanperfunctory acknowledgment, and departed.When she was gone, Professor Quirrell held up a finger for silenceagain, and drew his wand.And then Professor Quirrell began performing a certain series of incantations that Harry recognized, making him take a sharp breath. It wasthe series and ordering that Mr. Bester had used, the full set of twentyseven spells that you would perform before discussing anything of trulygreat import.If the discussion of the Chamber of Secrets hadn’t counted asimportant—When Professor Quirrell was done—he’d performed thirty spells,three of which Harry hadn’t heard before—the Defense Professor said,“Now we shall not be interrupted for a time. Can you keep a secret,Mr. Potter?”Harry nodded.“A serious secret, Mr. Potter,” Professor Quirrell said. His eyes wereintent, his face grave. “One which could potentially send me to Azkaban.Think about it before you reply.”For a moment Harry didn’t even see why the question should be hard,given his growing collection of secrets. Then—If this secret could send Professor Quirrell to Azkaban, that means he’s donesomething illegal…Harry’s brain performed a few calculations. Whatever the secret, Professor Quirrell did not think his illegal act would reflect badly on him inHarry’s eyes. There was no advantage to be gained from not hearing it.784 *And if it did reveal something wrong with Professor Quirrell, then it wasvery much to Harry’s advantage to know it, even if he had promised notto tell anyone.“I never had very much respect for authority,” Harry said. “Legal andgovernmental authority included. I will keep your secret.”Harry didn’t bother asking whether the revelation was worth the danger it would pose to Professor Quirrell. The Defense Professor wasn’tstupid.“Then I must test whether you are truly a descendant of Salazar,” saidProfessor Quirrell, and stood up from his chair. Harry, prompted moreby reflex and instinct than calculation, shoved himself up out of his ownchair as well.There was a blur, a shift, a sudden motion.Harry aborted his panicked backward leap halfway through, leavinghim windmilling his arms and trying not to fall over, a frantic flush ofadrenaline running through him.At the other end of the room swayed a snake a meter high, brightgreen and intricately banded in white and blue. Harry didn’t knowenough snakelore to recognize it, but he knew that ‘brightly colored’meant ‘poisonous’.The constant sense of doom had diminished, ironically enough, afterthe Defense Professor of Hogwarts had turned into a venomous snake.Harry swallowed hard and said, “Greetings—ah, hssss, no, ah, greetingss.”“Sso,” hissed the snake. “You sspeak, I hear. I sspeak, you hear?”“Yess, I hear,” hissed Harry. “You are an Animaguss?”“Obvioussly,” hissed the snake. “Thirty-sseven ruless, number thirty-four: Become Animaguss. All ssensible people do, if can. Thuss, very rare.” The snake’s eyeswere flat surfaces ensconced within dark pits, sharp black pupils in darkgray fields. “This iss mosst ssecure way to sspeak. You ssee? No otherss undersstanduss.”“Even if they are ssnake Animagi?”“Not unlesss heir of Sslytherin willss.” The snake gave a series of shorthisses which Harry’s brain translated as sardonic laughter. “Sslytherin785 *not sstupid. Ssnake Animaguss not ssame as Parsselmouth. Would be huge flaw insscheme.”Well that definitely argued that Parseltongue was personal magic, notsnakes being sentient beings with a learnable language—“I am not regisstered,” hissed the snake. The dark pits of its eyes staredat Harry. “Animaguss musst be regisstered. Penalty is two yearss imprissonment.Will you keep my ssecret, boy?”“Yess,” hissed Harry. “Would never break promisse.”The snake seemed to hold still, as though in shock, and then began tosway again. “We come here next in sseven dayss. Bring cloak to passs unsseen, bringhourglasss to move through time—”“You know?” hissed Harry in shock. “How—”Again the series of short quick hisses that translated as sardoniclaughter. “You arrive in my ﬁrsst classs while sstill in other classs, sstrike downenemy with pie, two ballss of memory—”“Never mind,” hissed Harry. “Sstupid question, forgot you were ssmart.”“Foolissh thing to forget,” said the snake, but the hiss did not seem offended.“Hourglasss is resstricted,” Harry said. “Cannot usse until ninth hour.”The snake twitched its head, a snakish nod. “Many resstrictionss. Lockedto your usse only, cannot be sstolen. Cannot transsport other humanss. But ssnakecarried in pouch, I ssuspect will go with. Think posssible to hold hourglasss motionlesss within sshell, without dissturbing wardss, while you turn sshell around it. Wewill tesst in sseven dayss. Will not sspeak of planss beyond thiss. You ssay nothing, tono one. Give no ssign of expectancy, none. Undersstand?”Harry nodded.“Ansswer in sspeech.”“Yess.”“Will do as I ssaid?”“Yess. But,” Harry gave a wobbling rasp that was how his mind hadtranslated a hesitant ‘Ahhh’ into snakish, “I do not promisse to do whateverthiss iss, you have not ssaid—”The snake performed a shiver that Harry’s mind translated as a severeglare. “Of coursse not. Will disscusss sspeciﬁcss at next meeting.”786 *The blur and motion reversed itself, and Professor Quirrell wasstanding there once more. For a moment the Defense Professor himselfseemed to sway, as the snake had swayed, and his eyes seemed cold andflat; and then his shoulders straightened and he was human once more.And the aura of doom had returned.Professor Quirrell’s chair scooted back for him, and he sat down in it.“No sense in letting this go to waste,” Professor Quirrell said as he pickedup his spoon, “though at the moment I would much prefer a live mouse.One can never quite disentangle the mind from the body it wears, yousee…”Harry slowly took his seat and began eating.“So the line of Salazar did not die with You-Know-Who after all,” said Professor Quirrell after a time. “It would seem that rumors have already begun to spread, among our fine student body, that you are Dark; I wonderwhat they would think, if they knew that.”“Or if they knew that I had destroyed a Dementor,” Harry said, andshrugged. “I figure all the fuss will blow over over the next time I dosomething interesting. Hermione is having trouble, though, and I waswondering if you might have any suggestions for her.”The Defense Professor ate several spoonfuls of soup in silence, then;and when he spoke again, his voice was oddly flat. “You really care aboutthat girl.”“Yes,” Harry said quietly.“I suppose that is why she was able to bring you out of your Dementation?”“More or less,” Harry said. The statement was true in a way, just notexact; it was not that his Demented self had cared, but that it had beenconfused.“I did not have any friends like that when I was young.” Still the sameemotionless voice. “What would have become of you, I wonder, if you hadbeen alone?”787 *Harry shivered before he could stop himself.“You must be feeling grateful to her.”Harry just nodded. Not quite exact, but true.“Then here is what I might have done at your age, if there had beenanyone to do it for—”788 *adma Patil had finished her dinner a little late, getting on towardseven-thirty, and was now striding quickly out of the Great Hall onher way to the Ravenclaw dorm and the study rooms. Gossiping was funand destroying Granger’s reputation was more fun, but it could distractfrom schoolwork. She’d put off a six-inch essay on lomillialor wood duein next morning’s Herbology class, and she needed to finish it tonight.It was while she was passing through a long, twisting, narrow stonecorridor that the whisper came, sounding like it was coming from rightbehind her.“Padma Patil…”She spun around quick as lightning, her wand already snatched upfrom a pocket of her robes and leaping into her hands, if Harry Potterthought he could sneak up on and scare her that easily—There was no one there.Instantly Padma spun around and looked in the other direction, if ithad been a Ventriloquism Charm—There was no one there, either.The whispering sigh came again, soft and dangerous with a slighthissing undertone.“Padma Patil, Slytherin girl…”“Harry Potter, Slytherin boy,” she said out loud.She’d fought Potter and his Chaos Legion a dozen times over, and sheknew that this was Harry Potter doing this somehow……even though the Ventriloquism Charm was only line-of-sight, andin the winding corridor, she could easily see all the way to the nearesttwist both forward and backward, and there was no one there…789 *…it didn’t matter. She knew her enemy.There was a whispery chuckle, now coming from beside her, and shespun around and pointed her wand at the whisper and shouted “Luminos!”The red bolt of light shot out and struck the wall, which lit with a crimson glow that soon faded.She hadn’t really expected it to work. Harry Potter couldn’t possibly beinvisible, not really invisible, that was magic most grownups couldn’t do,and she’d never believed nine-tenths of the stories about him.The whispery voice laughed again, now on her other side.“Harry Potter stands on the precipice,” whispered the voice, nowsounding very close to her ear, “he is wavering, but you, you are alreadyfalling, Slytherin girl…”“The hat never called out Slytherin for my name, Potter!” She backedup against the wall, so she wouldn’t have to watch behind herself, andraised her wand in an attack stance.Again the soft laugh. “Harry Potter has been in the Ravenclaw common room for the last half-hour, helping Kevin Entwhistle and MichaelCorner rehearse Potions recipes. But it matters not. I am here to delivera warning to you, Padma Patil, and if you choose to ignore it, that is yourown affair.”“Fine,” she said coldly. “Go ahead and warn me, Potter, I’m not afraidof you.”“Slytherin was a great House, once,” said the whisper; it sounded sadder, now. “Slytherin was once a House you would have been proud tochoose, Padma Patil. But something turned wrong, something turnedsour; do you know what went awry in Slytherin House, Padma Patil?”“No, and I don’t care!”“But you should care,” said the whisper, now sounding like it was coming from just behind her head where it stood almost pressed against thewall. “For you are still that girl whom the Sorting Hat offered that choice.Do you think that just choosing Ravenclaw means that you are not PansyParkinson, and will not ever become Pansy Parkinson, no matter how youconduct yourself otherwise?”Despite everything, now, small chills of fear were spreading out fromher spine and running over her skin. She’d heard those stories about790 *Harry Potter too, that he was a secret Legilimens. But she still stoodstraight, and she put all the bite she could into her voice when she said,“The Slytherins went Dark to get power, just like you did, Potter. And Iwon’t, not ever.”“But you’ll spread vicious rumors about an innocent girl,” whisperedthe voice, “even though it will not help you attain any of your own ambitions, and without considering that she has powerful allies who mighttake offense. That is not the proud Slytherin of the old days, Padma Patil,that is not the pride of Salazar, that is Slytherin gone rotten, PadmaParkinson not Padma Malfoy…”She was getting more creeped out than she ever had been in her life,and the possibility was starting to occur to her that this might really be aghost. She hadn’t ever heard that ghosts could hide themselves like this,but maybe they just didn’t usually do it—not to mention that most ghostsweren’t this eerie, they were just dead people after all—“Who are you? TheBloody Baron?”“When Harry Potter was bullied and beaten,” the voice whispered, “hecommanded all his allies to refrain from vengeance; do you rememberthat, Padma Patil? For Harry Potter is wavering, but not yet lost; he isstruggling, he knows himself to be in peril. But Hermione Granger madeno such request of her own allies. Harry Potter is angered with you now,Padma Patil, more angered than he would ever be on his own behalf… andhe has allies of his own.”A shudder went through her, she knew that it was visible and shehated herself for it.“Oh, don’t be afraid,” breathed the voice. “I will not hurt you. For yousee, Padma Patil, Hermione Granger truly is innocent. She does not standon the precipice, she is not falling. She did not ask her allies to refrainfrom hurting you, because the thought did not even occur to her as a possibility. And Harry Potter knows very well that if he hurt you or causedyou to be hurt, for Hermione Granger’s sake, then she would never speakto him again until the Sun burned low and the last star failed in the nightsky.” The voice was very sad now. “She truly is a kindly girl, a person suchas I could only wish to be…”“Granger can’t cast the Patronus Charm!” said Padma. “If she wasreally as nice as she pretends to be—”“Can you cast the Patronus Charm, Padma Patil? You dared not evenattempt it, you feared what the result would be.”“That’s not true! I didn’t have time, that was all!”The whisper continued. “But Hermione Granger did try, openly before her friends, and when her magic failed she was surprised and dismayed. For there are secrets to the Patronus Charm that few ever knew,and maybe none now know but I.” A soft, whispery chuckle. “Let it standthat it is no stain of her spirit that halts her light from coming forth. Hermione Granger cannot cast the Patronus Charm for the very same reasonthat Godric Gryffindor, who raised these halls, never could.”The corridor was becoming colder, she was certain of it, as thoughsomeone were using the Chilling Charm.“And Harry Potter is not Hermione Granger’s only ally.” Now therewas an undertone of dry amusement in that whisper, it reminded her suddenly and frighteningly of Professor Quirrell. “Filius Flitwick and Minerva McGonagall are quite fond of her, I do believe. Did it occur to youthat if those two learned what you were doing to Hermione Granger, theymight become less fond of you? They might not intervene openly, perhaps; but they might be a little slower to award you House Points, a littleslower to steer opportunities your way—”“Potter snarked on me?”A ghostly chuckle, a dry heh-heh-heh. “Do you think those two arestupid, deaf and blind?” In a sadder whisper, “Do you think HermioneGranger is not precious to them, that they will not see her hurting? Asthey might have been fond of you once, their bright young Padma Patil,but you are throwing it away…”Padma’s throat was dry. She hadn’t thought of that, not at all.“I wonder how many people will end up caring for you, Padma Patil,on this path that you now tread. Is it worth that much, just to distanceyourself further from your sister? To be the shadow to Parvati’s light?Your deepest fear has always been to fall into harmony with her, back intoharmony with her I should say; but is it worth hurting an innocent girl,just to make yourself that much more different? Must you be the evil twin,Padma Patil, can you not find a different good to pursue?”792 *Her heart was hammering in her chest. She’d, she’d never talkedabout that with anyone—“I have always wondered at how students bully each other,” sighed thevoice. “How children make life difficult for themselves, how they turntheir schools into prisons even with their own hands. Why do humanbeings make their own lives so unpleasant? I can give you a part of theanswer, Padma Patil. It is because people do not stop and think beforecausing pain, if they do not imagine that they themselves could also behurt, that they might also suffer from their own misdeeds. But sufferyou will, oh, yes, Padma Patil, suffer you will, if you stay on this road. Youwill suffer the same pain of loneliness, the same pain of others’ fear anddistrust, that you now inflict on Hermione Granger. Only for you it willbe deserved.”Her wand was shaking in her hand.“You did not choose sides when you went to Ravenclaw, girl. Youchoose your side by the way you live your life, what you do to other peopleand what you do to yourself. Will you illuminate others’ lives, or darkenthem? That is the choice between Light and Dark, not any word the Sorting Hat cries out. And the hard part, Padma Patil, is not saying ‘Light’, thehard part is deciding which is which, and admitting it to yourself whenyou begin down the wrong road.”There was silence. It went on for a time, and Padma realized that shehad been dismissed.Padma almost dropped her wand, when she tried to put it back intoher pocket. She almost fell, when she took a step forward away from thewall, and turned to go—“I have not always chosen rightly between Light and Dark,” the whisper said, now loud and harsh directly into her ear. “Do not take my wisdom as a final word, girl, do not fear to question it, for though I tried Ihave sometimes failed, oh, yes, I have failed. But you are hurting a true innocent, and you will achieve none of your ambitions by doing so, it is notfor any cunning plan. You are inflicting pain purely for the sake of thepleasure it brings you. I have not always chosen rightly between Lightand Dark, but that I know for darkness, for certain. You are hurting aninnocent girl, and escaping retribution only because she is too kindly to793 *tolerate her allies moving against you. I cannot hurt you for that, so knowonly that I cannot respect it. You are unworthy of Slytherin; go and doyour Herbology homework, Ravenclaw girl!”The final whisper came out in a louder hiss that sounded almost likea snake, and Padma fled, she fled down the corridors like Lethifolds werechasing her, she ran heedless of the rules about running in the corridors,even when she passed other students who looked at her in surprise, shedid not stop, she ran all the way to the Ravenclaw dorms with her pulsepounding in her neck, the door asked her “Why does the Sun shine in theday instead of the nighttime?” and it took her three tries before she couldmake her answer coherent, and then the door came open and she saw——a few girls and boys, some young and some old, all staring at her,and in one corner at the pentagonal table, Harry Potter and Michael Corner and Kevin Entwhistle, looking up from their textbooks.“Sweet Merlin!” exclaimed Penelope Clearwater, rising from a couch.“What happened to you, Padma?”“I,” she stuttered, “I, I heard—a ghost—”“It wasn’t the Bloody Baron, was it?” said Clearwater. She drew herwand and a moment later she was holding a cup, and then an Aguamentilater the cup was filled with water. “Here, drink this, sit down—”Padma was already striding toward the pentagonal table. She lookedat Harry Potter, who was looking at her with his own gaze, calm and graveand a little sad.“You did this!” Padma said. “How—you—how dare you!”There was a sudden hush in the Ravenclaw dorm.Harry just looked at her.And said, “Is there anything I can help you with?”“Don’t deny it,” Padma said, her voice shaking, “you set that ghost onme, it said—”“I mean it,” Harry said. “Can I help you with anything? Get you somefood, or go fetch a soda for you, or help you with your homework, or anything like that?”Everyone was staring at the two of them.“Why?” Padma said. She couldn’t think of anything else to say, shedidn’t understand.794 *“Because some of us are standing on the precipice,” Harry said. “Andthe difference is what you do for other people. Will you let me help youwith something, Padma, please?”She stared at him, and knew, in that moment, that he’d gotten hisown warning, same as her.“I…” she said. “I’ve got to write six inches on lomillialor—”“Let me run up to my dorm room and get my Herbology stuff,” Harrysaid. He rose from the pentagonal table, looked at Entwhistle and Corner.“Sorry, guys, I’ll see you later.”They didn’t say anything, just stared, along with everyone else in thedorm room, as Harry Potter walked over to the stairs.And just as he started up, he said, “And no one’s to pester her withquestions unless she wants to talk about it, I hope everyone’s got that?”“Got it,” said most of the first years and some of the older students, afew of them sounding quite scared.And she talked about a lot of things with Harry Potter besides lomillialorwood—even her fear of falling back into harmony with Parvati, whichshe’d never talked about with anyone before, but then Harry’s ghostly allyalready knew. And Harry had reached into his pouch and pulled out someodd books, loaning them to her on condition of complete secrecy, sayingthat if she could comprehend those books it would change the patternof her thinking enough that she’d never fall into harmony with Parvatiagain…At nine o’ clock, when Harry said he had to go, the essay was only halfdone.And when Harry paused, and looked at her on the way out, and saidthat he thought she was worthy of Slytherin, it made her feel good for awhole minute before she realized what had just been said to her and whohad said it.795 *When Padma got down to breakfast, that morning, she saw Mandy seeher and whisper something to the girl sitting beside her at the Ravenclawtable.She saw that girl get up from the bench and walk toward her.Last night Padma had been glad that girl roomed in the other dorm;but now that she thought about it, this was worse, now she had to do it infront of everyone.But even though Padma was sweating, she knew what she had to do.The girl came closer—“I’m sorry.”“What?” said Padma. That was her line.“I’m sorry,” repeated Hermione Granger. Her voice was loud so thateveryone could hear. “I… I didn’t ask Harry to do that, and I was angrywith him when I found out, and I made him promise not to do it againto anyone, and I’m not talking to him for a week… I’m really, really sorry,Miss Patil.”Hermione Granger’s back was stiff, her face was stiff, you could seethe sweat on her face.“Um,” said Padma. Her own thoughts were pretty much scrambled,now…Padma’s gaze flicked to the Ravenclaw table, where one boy waswatching them with tight eyes and his hands clenched in his lap.796 *Earlier:“I told you to be nicer!” shrieked Hermione.Harry was starting to sweat. He’d never actually heard Hermionescream at him before, and it was quite loud in the empty classroom.“I—but—but I was nice!” Harry protested. “I practically redeemed her,Padma was going down the wrong path and I turned her off it! I probably changed her whole life to be happier! Besides, you should’ve heardthe original version of what Professor Quirrell suggested I do—” at whichpoint Harry realized what he was saying and closed his mouth a secondtoo late.Hermione clutched at her chestnut curls, a gesture Harry hadn’t seenfrom her before. “What’d he say to do? Kill her?”The Defense Professor had suggested that Harry identify all the keyinfluential students inside and outside his year and try to gain controlof the entire Hogwarts rumor mill, remarking that this was a generallyuseful and amusing challenge for any true Slytherin attending Hogwarts.“Nothing like that,” Harry said quickly, “he just said in a general waythat I should get influence over the people spreading rumors, and I decided that the nice version of that would be to just inform Padma directlyabout the meaning of what she was doing, and the possible consequencesof her actions, instead of trying to threaten her or anything like that—”“You call that not threatening someone?” Hermione’s hands were pullingat her hair now.“Um…” Harry said. “I guess she might’ve felt a little threatened, butHermione, people will do whatever they think they can get away with,they don’t care about how much it hurts other people if it doesn’t hurtthemselves, if Padma thinks there’s no consequences to spreading liesabout you then of course she’ll just go on doing it—”“And you think there’s going to be no consequences to what you did?”Harry got a sudden sick feeling to his stomach.Hermione had the angriest look on her that he’d ever seen. “What doyou think the other students think of you now, Harry? Of me? If Harrydoesn’t like the way you talk about Hermione, you’ll get ghosts set on you,is that what you want them to think?”797 *Harry opened his mouth and no words came out, he just… hadn’tthought about it that way, actually…Hermione reached down to grab her books from the table where she’dslammed them. “I’m not talking to you for a week, and I’ll tell everyone I’mnot talking to you for a week, and I’ll tell them why, and maybe that’ll undosome of what you just did. And after that week, I‘ll—I’ll decide then whatto do, I guess—”“Hermione!” Harry’s own voice rose to a shriek of desperation. “I wastrying to help!”The girl turned back and looked at him as she opened the classroomdoor.“Harry,” she said, and her voice trembled a little beneath the anger,“Professor Quirrell is sucking you into the darkness, he really is, I meanit, Harry.”“This… wasn’t him, this wasn’t what he said to do, this was just me—”Hermione’s voice was almost a whisper now. “Someday you’re goingto go out to lunch with him, and it will be your dark side that comes back,or maybe even you won’t come back at all.”“I promise you,” Harry said, “that I will come back from lunch.”He wasn’t even thinking as he said it.And Hermione just turned around and strode out and slammed thedoor behind her.Way to invoke the laws of dramatic irony, moron, observed Harry’s Internal Critic. Now you’re going to die this Saturday, your last words will be ‘I’msorry, Hermione’, and she’ll always regret that the last thing she did was slam thedoor—Oh, shut up.When Padma sat down with Hermione for breakfast, and said in a voiceloud enough for others to hear that the ghost had just told her things thatwere important for her to hear, and Harry Potter had been right to do it,there were some people who were less frightened afterward, and somewho were frightened more.798 *And afterward people did say fewer nasty things about Hermione, atleast in the first year, at least in public where Harry Potter might hearabout it.When Professor Flitwick asked Harry if he was responsible for whathad happened to Padma, and Harry said yes, Professor Flitwick told himthat he was to serve two days’ detention. Even if it had only been a ghostand Padma hadn’t been hurt, still, that wasn’t acceptable behavior for aRavenclaw student. Harry nodded and said that he understood why theProfessor had to do that, and wouldn’t protest; but considering that it didseem to have turned Padma around, did Professor Flitwick really think,off the record, that he’d done the wrong thing? And Professor Flitwickpaused, seeming to actually think about it, and then said to Harry, in asolemnly squeaky voice, that he needed to learn how to relate to otherstudents the normal way.And Harry couldn’t help but think that this was advice that ProfessorQuirrell would never give him.Harry couldn’t help but think that if he’d done it Professor Quirrell’sway, the normal Slytherin way, a mixture of positive and negative incentives to bring Padma and the other rumor-mongers under his explicit control, then Padma wouldn’t have talked about it, and Hermione would havenever found out……in which case Padma wouldn’t have been redeemed, she would havestayed on the wrong path, and she herself would have suffered from thateventually. It wasn’t as if Harry had lied to Padma in any way, when hewas Time-Turned and invisible and using the Ventriloquism Charm.Harry still wasn’t sure whether he’d done the right thing, or a rightthing, and Hermione hadn’t relented on not talking to him—though shewas talking a lot with Padma. It hurt more than Harry had expected, going back to studying by himself; like his brain had already started to forget its long-honed skill of being alone.The days until Saturday’s lunch with Professor Quirrell seemed to goby very, very slowly.799 *aturday.Harry had run into trouble falling asleep Friday night, which hehad anticipated might happen, and so he had decided to take the obviousadvance precaution of buying a sleeping potion; and to prevent it fromconstituting a visible sign that he was nervous, he had decided to buy itoff Fred and George a couple of months earlier. (Be prepared, that’s the BoyScout’s marching song…)Thus Harry was fully rested, and his pouch contained almost everything which he owned and might conceivably need. Harry had, in fact,run into the volume limitation on the pouch; and keeping in mind thathe would need to store a large snake, and might need to store who-knewwhat-else, he had removed some of the bulkier items, like the car battery.He was up to the point now where he could Transfigure something thesize of a car battery in four minutes flat, so it wasn’t much of a loss.Harry had kept the emergency flares and the oxyacetylene weldingtorch and fuel tank, since you couldn’t just Transfigure things that wereto be burned.(Be prepared, as through life you march along…)Mary’s Place.After the waitress had taken their order and bowed to them and leftthe room, Professor Quirrell had performed only four Charms, and thenthey’d talked about nothing of any vast consequence, just Professor Quirrell’s complex thesis about how the Dark Lord’s curse on the Defense position had led to the decline of dueling and how this had changed social801 *customs in magical Britain. Harry listened and nodded and said intelligent things, while he tried to control the pounding of his heart.Then the waitress came in again bearing their food, and this time,a minute after the waitress had departed, Professor Quirrell gesturedfor the door to close and lock, and began to speak twenty-nine securityCharms, one of the ones in Mr. Bester’s sequence being left out this time,which somewhat puzzled Harry.Professor Quirrell finished his Charms——stood up from his chair——blurred into a green snake, banded in blue and white——hissed, “Hungry, boy? Eat your ﬁll sswiftly, we sshall need both sstrength andtime.”Harry’s eyes were a bit wide, but he hissed, “I ate well at breakfasst,” andthen rapidly began forking noodles into his mouth.The snake watched him for a moment, with those flat eyes, and thenhissed, “Do not wissh to explain here. Prefer to be elssewhere ﬁrsst. Need to leaveunobsserved, without ssign we have ever departed room.”“Sso no one can track uss,” hissed Harry.“Yess. Do you trusst me that much, boy? Think before ansswer. I will have important requesst of you, which requiress trusst; if ssay no regardlesss, then ssay no now.”Harry dropped his gaze from the snake’s flat eyes, and looked backdown at his sauce-coated noodles, and ate another bite, then another,while he thought.The Defense Professor… was an ambiguous figure, to put it mildly;Harry thought he had unraveled some of his goals, but others remainedmysterious.But Professor Quirrell had knocked down two hundred girls to stopthe ones summoning Harry. Professor Quirrell had deduced that the Dementor was draining Harry through his wand. The Defense Professorhad saved Harry’s life, twice, in a two-week period.Which could mean that the Defense Professor was just saving Harryfor later, that there were ulterior motives. Indeed, it was certain that therewere ulterior motives. Professor Quirrell wasn’t doing this on a whim.But then Professor Quirrell had also seen Harry taught Occlumency, hehad taught Harry how to lose… if the Defense Professor wanted to make802 *some use of Harry Potter, it was a use that required a strengthened HarryPotter, not a weakened one. That was what it meant to be used by a friend,that they would want the use to make you stronger instead of weaker.And if there was sometimes a cold atmosphere about the Defense Professor, bitterness in his voice or emptiness in his gaze, then Harry was theonly one who Professor Quirrell allowed to see it.Harry didn’t quite know how to describe in words the sense of kinshiphe felt with Professor Quirrell, except to say that the Defense Professorwas the only clear-thinking person Harry had met in the wizarding world.Sooner or later everyone else started playing Quidditch, or not puttingprotective shells on their time machines, or thinking that Death was theirfriend. It didn’t matter how good their intentions were. Sooner or later,and usually sooner, they demonstrated that something deep inside theirbrain was confused. Everyone except Professor Quirrell. It was a bondthat went beyond anything of debts owed, or even anything of personalliking, that the two of them were alone in the wizarding world. And if theDefense Professor occasionally seemed a little scary or a little Dark, well,that was just the same thing some people said about Harry.“I trusst you,” hissed Harry.And the snake explained the first stage of the plan.Harry took a final forkful of noodles, chewed. Beside him, Professor Quirrell, now in human form again, was eating his soup placidly, as thoughnothing of special interest were occurring.Then Harry swallowed, and in the same moment stood up from hischair, already feeling his heart start to hammer hard in his chest. Thesecurity precautions they were taking were literally the most stringentpossible…“Are you ready to test it, Mr. Potter?” Professor Quirrell said calmly.It wasn’t a test, but Professor Quirrell wouldn’t say that, not out loudin human speech, even in this room screened to the limit that ProfessorQuirrell had secured with further Charms.“Yep,” Harry said as casually as he could.Step one.Harry said “Cloak” to his pouch, drew forth the Cloak of Invisibility,and then unstuck the pouch from his belt and threw it toward the otherside of the table.The Defense Professor stood up from his own seat, drew his wand,bent down, and touched his wand to the pouch, murmuring a quiet incantation. The new enchantments would ensure that Professor Quirrellcould enter the pouch on his own in snakeform, and leave it on his own,and hear what went on outside while he was in the pouch.Step two.As Professor Quirrell stood up from where he’d bent over by the pouch,and put away his wand, his wand happened to point in Harry’s direction,and there was a brief crawling sensation on Harry’s chest near where theTime-Turner lay, like something creepy had passed very close by withouttouching him.Step three.The Defense Professor turned into a snake again, and the sense ofdoom diminished; the snake crawled to the pouch and into it, the pouch’smouth opening to admit the green shape, and as the mouth closed againbehind the tail, the sense of doom diminished further.Step four.Harry drew his wand, being careful to stand still as he did it, sothat the Time-Turner would not move from where Professor Quirrellhad anchored the hourglass within the shell in its current orientation.“Wingardium Leviosa,” murmured Harry, and the pouch began to floattoward him.Slowly, slowly, as Professor Quirrell had instructed, the pouch beganto float toward Harry, who waited alert for any sign the pouch was opening, in which case Harry was to use the Hover Charm to propel it awayfrom him as fast as possible.As the pouch came within a meter of Harry, the sense of doom returned.As Harry reattached the pouch to his belt, the sense of doom wasstronger than it had ever been, but still not overwhelming; it was tolera* 804 *ble.Even with Professor Quirrell’s Animagus form lying within the extended space of the pouch resting on Harry’s very hip.Step five.Harry sheathed his wand. His other hand still held the Cloak of Invisibility, and Harry drew that cloak over himself.Step six.And so in that room shielded from every possible scrying, which Professor Quirrell had personally and further secured, it was not until afterHarry was wearing the true Cloak of Invisibility that he reached beneathhis shirt and twisted the outer shell of the Time-Turner just once.The Time-Turner’s inner hourglass stayed anchored and motionless,the setting twisted around it—The food vanished from the table, the chairs leaped back into place,the door sprang open.Mary’s Room was deserted, as it should have been, because ProfessorQuirrell had earlier contacted Mary’s Place under a false name to inquirewhether the room would be available at this hour—not to reserve it, notto place a canceled reservation that might be noted, but only to inquire.Step seven.Staying under the Cloak of Invisibility, Harry left through the opendoor. He navigated the tiled hallways of Mary’s Place to the well-stockedbar that greeted new entrants, tended by the owner, Jake. There wereonly a few people at the bar, in the morning before proper lunchtime, andHarry had to wait invisibly by the door for several minutes, listening tothe murmur of conversation and the gurgle of alcohol, before the dooropened to admit a huge genial Irishman, and Harry slipped out silentlyin his wake.Step eight.Harry walked for a while. He was well away from Mary’s Place whenhe turned off Diagon Alley into a smaller alley, at the end of which lay ashop that was dark, the windows enchanted to blackness.Step nine.“Sword fish melon friend,” Harry spoke the passphrase to the lock,and it clicked open.805 *Within the shop was also darkness, the light from the open doorbriefly illuminating it to show a wide, empty room. The furniture shopwhich had once operated here had gone bankrupt a few months ago,according to the Defense Professor, and the shop had been repossessed,but not yet resold. The walls were painted a simple white, the woodenfloor scratched and unpolished, a single closed door set in the back wall;this had been a showroom, once, but now it showed nothing.The door clicked shut behind Harry, and then the darkness was pitchand complete.Step ten.Harry took out his wand and said “Lumos”, lighting the room withwhite glow; he took his pouch from his belt (the sense of doom growing alittle sharper as he grasped it with his fingers) and lightly tossed it to theopposite side of the room (the sense of doom fading almost completely).And then he began to take off the Cloak of Invisibility, even as his voicehissed, “It iss done.”Step eleven.From the pouch poked a green head, followed shortly by a meter-longgreen body as the snake slithered out. A moment later, the snake blurredinto Professor Quirrell.Step twelve.Harry waited in silence while the Defense Professor recited thirtyCharms.“All right,” Professor Quirrell said calmly, when he had finished. “Ifanyone is still watching us now, we are in any case doomed, so I will speakplainly and in human form. Parseltongue does not quite suit me, I fear,as I am neither a descendant of Salazar nor a true snake.”Harry nodded.“So, Mr. Potter,” said Professor Quirrell. His gaze intent, his pale blueeyes dark and shadowed in the white light coming from Harry’s wand.“We are alone and unobserved, and I have an important question to askyou.”“Go ahead,” said Harry, his heart starting to beat faster.“What is your opinion of the government of magical Britain?”That wasn’t quite what Harry had been expecting, but it was closeenough, so Harry said, “Based on my limited knowledge, I would say thatboth the Ministry and the Wizengamot appear to be stupid, corrupt, andevil.”“Correct,” Professor Quirrell said. “Do you understand why I ask?”Harry took a deep breath, and looked Professor Quirrell straight inthe eyes, unflinching. Harry had finally worked out that the way to makeamazing deductions from scanty evidence was to know the answer in advance, and he had guessed this answer fully a week ago. It needed only aslight adjustment…“You are about to invite me to join a secret organization full of interesting people like yourself,” said Harry, “one of whose goals is to reformor overthrow the government of magical Britain, and yes, I’m in.”There was a slight pause.“I’m afraid that is not quite where I intended to direct this conversation,” said Professor Quirrell. The corners of his lips were twitchingslightly. “I merely planned to ask for your help in doing something extremely treasonous and illegal.”Darn, thought Harry. Still, Professor Quirrell hadn’t denied it… “Goon.”“Before I do,” said Professor Quirrell. There was no levity in his voice,now. “Are you open to such requests, Mr. Potter? I say again that if you arelikely to say no regardless, you must say no now. If your curiosity impelsyou otherwise, squash it.”“Treasonous and illegal doesn’t bother me,” said Harry. “Risks botherme and the stakes would need to be commensurate, but I can’t imagineyou taking risks frivolously.”Professor Quirrell nodded. “I would not. It is a terrible abuse of myfriendship with you, and of such trust as is placed in my teaching positionat Hogwarts—”“You can skip this part,” Harry said.The lips twitched again, and then went flat. “Then I shall skip it.Mr. Potter, you sometimes make a game of lying with truths, playingwith words to conceal your meanings in plain sight. I, too, have beenknown to find that amusing. But if I so much as tell you what I hope we807 *shall do this day, Mr. Potter, you will lie about it. You will lie straight out,without hesitation, without wordplay or hints, to anyone who asks aboutit, be they foe or closest friend. You will lie to Malfoy, to Granger, and toMcGonagall. You will speak, always and without hesitation, in exactly thefashion you would speak if you knew nothing, with no concern for yourhonor. That also is how it must be.”There was silence, then, for a time.That was a price measured in a fraction of Harry’s soul.“Without telling me yet…” said Harry. “Can you say if the need is desperate?”“There is someone in the most terrible want of your help,” ProfessorQuirrell said simply, “and there is no one who can help them but you.”There was another silence, but not a long one.“All right,” Harry said quietly. “Tell me of the mission.”The dark robes of the Defense Professor seemed to blur against theshadow on the wall, cast by his silhouette blocking the white light ofHarry’s wand. “The ordinary Patronus Charm, Mr. Potter, wards offa Dementor’s fear. But the Dementors still see you through it, theyknow that you are there. Only not your Patronus Charm. It blinds them,or more than blinds them. What I saw beneath the cloak wasn’t evenlooking in our direction as you killed it; as though it had forgotten ourexistence, even as it died.”Harry nodded. That wasn’t surprising, not when you confronted aDementor on the level of its true existence, beyond anthropomorphism.Death might be the last enemy, but it wasn’t a sentient enemy. Whenhumanity had wiped out smallpox, smallpox hadn’t fought back.“Mr. Potter, the central branch of Gringotts is guarded by every spellhigh and low that the goblins know. Even so those vaults have been successfully robbed; for what wizardry can do, wizardry can undo. And yetno one has ever escaped from Azkaban. No one. For every Charm thereis a counter-Charm, for every ward there is a bypass. How can it be thatno one has ever been rescued from Azkaban?”“Because Azkaban has something invincible,” Harry said. “Something so terrible that no one can defeat it.”That was the keystone of their perfect security, it had to be, nothinghuman. It was Death that guarded Azkaban.“The Dementors don’t like their meals being taken away from them,”Professor Quirrell said. Coldness had entered that voice, now. “Theyknow if anyone tries. There are more than a hundred Dementors there,and they speak to the guards as well. It’s that simple, Mr. Potter. If you’rea powerful wizard then Azkaban isn’t hard to enter, and it isn’t hard toleave. So long as you don’t try to take anything out of it that belongs tothe Dementors.”“But the Dementors are not invincible,” said Harry. He could havecast the Patronus Charm with that thought, in that very moment. “Neverbelieve that they are.”Professor Quirrell’s voice was very quiet. “Do you remember what itwas like when you went before the Dementor, the first time, when youfailed?”“I remember.”And then with a sudden sickening lurch in his stomach, Harry knewwhere this was going; he should have seen it before.“There is an innocent person in Azkaban,” Professor Quirrell said.Harry nodded, there was a burning sensation in his throat, but hedidn’t cry.“The one of whom I speak was not under the Imperius Curse,” saidthe Defense Professor, dark robes silhouetted against a greater shadow.“There are surer ways to break wills than the Imperius, if you have thetime for torture, and Legilimency, and rituals of which I will not speak. Icannot tell you how I know this, how I know any of this, cannot hint at iteven to you, you will have to trust me. But there is a person in Azkabanwho never once chose to serve the Dark Lord, who has spent years suffering alone in the most terrible cold and darkness imaginable, and neverdeserved a single minute of it.”Harry saw it in a single leap of intuition, his mouth racing almostahead of his thoughts.There was no hint, no warning, we all thought—“A person by the name of Black,” Harry said.There was silence. Silence, while the pale blue eyes stared at him.“Well,” said Professor Quirrell after a while. “So much for not tellingyou the name until after you had accepted the mission. I would askwhether you’re reading my mind, but that’s flatly impossible.”Harry said nothing, but it was simple enough if you believed in the processes of modern democracy. The most obvious person in Azkaban to beinnocent was the one who hadn’t gotten a trial—“I am certainly impressed, Mr. Potter,” said Professor Quirrell. Hisface was grave. “But this is a serious matter, and if there is some way others could make the same deduction, I must know. So tell me, Mr. Potter.How in the name of Merlin, of Atlantis, and the void between the stars,did you guess that I was talking about Bellatrix?”810 *he adrenaline was already flowing in Harry’s veins, his heart alreadyhammering in his chest, there in that darkened and bankrupt store.Professor Quirrell had finished explaining, and in one hand, Harry held atiny wooden twig that would be the key. This was it, this was the day andthe moment when Harry started acting the part. His first true adventure,a dungeon to be pierced, an evil government to be defied, a maiden indistress to be rescued. Harry should have been more frightened, morereluctant, but instead he felt only that it was time and past time to startbecoming the people he had read about in his books; to begin his journey toward what he had always known he was meant to be, a hero. Totake the first step on the road that led to Kimball Kinnison and CaptainPicard and Liono of Thundera and definitely not Raistlin Majere. So faras Harry’s brain knew from watching early morning cartoons, when yougrew up you were supposed to gain amazing powers and save the universe, that was what Harry’s brain had seen adults doing and adopted asits role model for the maturation process, and Harry very much wantedto start growing up.And if the pattern of the story called for the hero to lose some part ofhis innocence, as the result of his first adventure; then for now, at least,in this still-innocent moment, it seemed time and past time for him toexperience that pain. Like casting off clothes too small for him; or like finally advancing to the next stage of the game, after being stuck for elevenyears on world 3, level 2 of Super Mario Brothers.Harry had read enough novels to suspect that he wouldn’t feel thisenthusiastic afterward, so he was enjoying it while it lasted.There was a popping sound as something near Harry disappeared,and then there was no more time for heroic brooding.Harry’s hand snapped the small wooden twig.A hook yanked motionlessly at Harry’s abdomen as the portkey activated, feeling like a much harder pull this time than the smaller transports between the Hogwarts grounds and Diagon Alley——and dropped him into the middle of a huge roll of thunder dyingaway, and a lash of cold rain whipping him across the face, the water coating Harry’s glasses and blinding him in an instant, turning the world intoa blur even as he began to fall toward the raging ocean waves far below.He had arrived high, high, high above the empty North Sea.The shock of the blasting storm almost made Harry let go of thebroomstick that Professor Quirrell had given him, which would not havebeen a good idea. It took nearly a full second for Harry to get his witstogether and bring his broomstick back up in an easy swoop.“I’m here,” said an unfamiliar voice from a patch of empty air abovehim; low and gravelly, the voice of the sallow lanky bearded man Professor Quirrell had Polyjuiced into before Disillusioning himself and hisbroomstick.“I’m here,” Harry said from beneath the Cloak of Invisibility. Hehadn’t used Polyjuice himself. Wearing a different body hindered yourmagic, and Harry might need all of his little magic about him; thusthe plan called for Harry to stay invisible at nearly all times, instead ofPolyjuicing.(Neither of them had spoken the other’s name. You simply didn’t useyour names at any point during an illegal mission, even invisibly hoveringover an anonymous patch of water in the North Sea. You simply didn’t.It would be stupid.)Carefully keeping a grip on the broomstick with one hand, while therain and wind howled around him, Harry raised his wand in an equallycareful grip and Imperviused his glasses.Then, with the lenses clear, Harry looked around.He was surrounded by wind and rain, it might have been five degreesCelsius if he was lucky; he’d already had a Warming Charm cast on himself just from being outside in February, but it wasn’t standing up to thedriving cold droplets. Worse than snow, the rain soaked into every exposed surface. The Cloak of Invisibility turned all of you invisible, butit didn’t cover all of you, and that meant it didn’t protect all of you fromrain. Harry’s face was exposed to the full force of the driven water, andit was driving straight into his neck and soaking down into his shirt, alsothe sleeves of his robes and the cuffs of his pants and his shoes, the watertook every bit of cloth as an avenue to sneak in.“This way,” said the Polyjuiced voice, and a spark of green light lit upin front of Harry’s broomstick, and then darted away in a direction thatseemed to Harry like every other direction.Through the blinding rain, Harry followed. He lost it sometimes, thatsmall green spark, and each time he did, Harry called out, and the sparkwould reappear in front of him a few seconds later.When Harry had caught the trick of following the spark, it accelerated, and Harry kicked the broomstick into high gear and followed. Therain whipped him harder, feeling like Harry imagined it must feel to geta faceful of shotgun pellets, but his glasses stayed clear and protected hiseyes.It was only a few minutes later, at the broomstick’s full speed, thatHarry caught a glimpse of a huge shadow through the rain, towering faracross the waters.And felt a distant, hollow echo of emptiness radiating from whereDeath waited, washing over Harry’s mind and parting around it, like awave breaking on stone. Harry knew his enemy this time, and his willwas steel and all of the light.“I can already feel the Dementors,” said the gravelly voice of thePolyjuiced Quirrell. “I did not expect that, not this soon.”“Think of the stars,” Harry said, over a distant rumble of thunder.“Don’t allow any anger in you, nothing negative, just think of the stars,what it feels like to forget yourself and fall bodilessly through space. Holdto that thought like an Occlumency barrier across your entire mind. TheDementors will have some trouble reaching past that.”There was silence for a moment, then, “Interesting.”The green spark lifted, and Harry inclined his broomstick slightly upward to follow, even as it steered them into a fogbank, a cloud hoveringlow on the waters.Soon they were hovering above and slightly oblique of the huge threesided metal building, as it loomed far below. The triangle of steel washollow, not solid, it was a building of three thick solid walls and nocenter. The Aurors on guard roomed in the top level and southern sideof the building, Professor Quirrell had said, protected by their PatronusCharms. The legal entrance into Azkaban was on the roof of the southwest corner of the building. Which the two of them wouldn’t use, ofcourse. Instead they would use a corridor that ran directly beneath thenorthern corner of the building. Professor Quirrell would go down first,and puncture a hole in the roof and its wards right at the northern tip,leaving behind an illusion to cover the gap.The prisoners were kept in the side of the building, in levels corresponding to their crimes. And at the bottom, in the uttermost center anddepth of Azkaban, lay a nest of more than a hundred Dementors. Loadsof dirt were occasionally dropped in to keep up the level, as the matter directly exposed to the Dementors broke down into mud and nothingness…“Wait one minute,” said the rough voice, “follow me at speed, and passthrough with care.”“Got it,” Harry said lowly.The spark winked out, and Harry began to count, one one thousand, twoone thousand, three one thousand……sixty one thousand, and Harry dived, the wind shrieking around himas he dived, down toward the vast metal structure, down toward wherehe could feel the shadows of Death waiting for him, draining light andradiating emptiness, as the metal structure grew larger and larger. Plainand featureless loomed the vast grey shape, but for a single raised boxlikestructure in the southwest corner. The north corner was simply blank,Professor Quirrell’s hole undetectable.Harry pulled up sharply as he approached the north corner, givinghimself more safety margin than he would have bothered with in flyingclasses, but not too much. As soon as he’d come to a halt, he began toslowly lower his broomstick again, toward what looked like the solid roofof the tip of the north corner.Descending through the illusory roof while invisible was a strange experience, and then Harry found himself in a metal corridor lighted with adim orange light—which, Harry realized after a startled glance, was coming from an old-fashioned mantled gas lamp……for magic would fail, be drained away after a time, in the presenceof Dementors.Harry dismounted his broom.The pull of the emptiness was stronger now, as it parted and flowedaround Harry without touching him. They were distant but they weremany, the wounds in the world; Harry could have pointed to them withhis eyes closed.“Casst your Patronuss,” hissed a snake from the floor, looking more discolored than green in the dim orange light.The note of stress came through even in Parseltongue. Harry was surprised; Professor Quirrell had said that Animagi in their Animagus formswere much less vulnerable to Dementors. (For the same reason the Patronuses were animals, Harry assumed.) If Professor Quirrell was in thismuch trouble in his snake form, what had been happening to him whilehe was in the human form that let him use his magic…?Harry’s wand was already rising in his hand.This would be the beginning.Even if it was only one person, just one person that he could save fromthe darkness, even if he wasn’t powerful enough yet to teleport all of Azkaban’s prisoners to safety and burn the triangular hell down to bedrock…Even so it was a start, it was a beginning, it was a down payment oneverything that Harry meant to accomplish with his life. No more waiting, no more hoping, no more mere promising, it would all begin here.Here and now.Harry’s wand slashed down to point at where the Dementors waitedfar below.“Expecto Patronum!”The glowing humanoid figure blazed up into existence. It wasn’t thesun-bright thing that it had been before… probably because Harry hadn’tquite been able to stop himself from thinking about all the other prisonersin their cells, the ones that he wasn’t here to save.It might be for the best, though. Harry would need to keep this Patronus going for a while, and it might be better if it wasn’t quite so bright.The Patronus dimmed a little further, at that thought; and then further again, as Harry tried to put a little less of his strength into it, untilfinally the brilliant humanoid figure was glowing only slightly brighterthan the brightest animal Patronus, and Harry felt that he could dim itno further without risking losing it entirely.And then, “It iss sstable,” Harry hissed, and began feeding his broomstick into his pouch. His wand stayed in his hand, and a slight, sustainable flow from him replaced the slight losses from his Patronus.The snake blurred into the form of a lanky, sallow man, holding Professor Quirrell’s wand in one hand and a broomstick in the other. Thelanky man staggered as he came back into existence, and went to leanagainst the wall for a moment.“Well done, if perhaps a trifle slow,” murmured the gravelly voice. Professor Quirrell’s dryness was in it, even though it didn’t fit the voice, nordid the grave look on the thickly bearded face. “I cannot feel them at all,now.”A moment later, the broomstick went into the man’s robes and vanished. Then the man’s wand rose and tapped on his head, and with asound like a cracking eggshell he disappeared once more.Within the air blossomed a faint green spark, and Harry, still enshrouded in the Cloak of Invisibility, followed after.If you had been watching from outside, you would have seen nothingbut a small green spark drifting through the air, and a brilliantly silverhumanoid walking after it.They went down, and down, and down, passing gas lamp after gas lamp,and the occasional huge metal door, descending into Azkaban withinwhat seemed like utter silence. Professor Quirrell had set up some typeof barrier by which he could hear what went on nearby, but no soundscould pass outward, and no sounds could reach Harry.Harry hadn’t quite been able to stop his mind from wondering whythe silence, or stop his mind from giving the answer. The answer he’dalready known on some wordless level of anticipation that had promptedhim to futilely try not to think about it.Somewhere behind those huge metal doors, people were screaming.The silver humanoid figure wavered, brightening and dimming, every time Harry thought about it.Harry had been told to cast a Bubble-Head Charm on himself. To prevent himself from smelling anything.All the enthusiasm and heroism had worn off already, as Harry hadknown it would, it hadn’t taken long even by his standards, the processhad completed itself the very first time they passed one of those metaldoors. Every metal door was locked with a huge lock, a lock of simple unmagical metal that wouldn’t have stopped a first-year Hogwartsstudent—if you still had a wand, if you still had your magic, which theprisoners didn’t. Those metal doors were not the doors of individualcells, Professor Quirrell had said, each one opened into a corridor inwhich there would be a group of cells. Somehow that helped a little, notthinking that each door corresponded directly to a prisoner who waswaiting right behind it. Instead there might be more than one prisoner,which diminished the emotional impact; just like the study showing thatpeople contributed more when they were told that a given amount ofmoney was required to save one child’s life, than when told the sametotal amount was needed to save eight children…Harry was finding it increasingly hard not to think about it, and everytime he did, the light of his Patronus fluctuated.They came to the place where the passageway turned left, at the cornerof the triangular building. Once again there were descending metal steps,another flight of stairs; once again they went down.Mere murderers were not put into the lowest of cells. There was always a lower place you could go, an even worse punishment to fear. Nomatter how low you had already sunk, the government of magical Britainhad some threat remaining against you if you did even worse.But Bellatrix Black had been the Death Eater who inspired more fearthan anyone save Lord Voldemort himself, a beautiful and deadly sorceress absolutely loyal to her master; she had been, if such a thing were possible, more sadistic and evil even than You-Know-Who, as though she weretrying to outdo her master……that was what the world knew of her, what the world believed of her.But before then, Professor Quirrell had told Harry, before the debut ofthe Dark Lord’s most terrible servant, there had been a girl in Slytherinwho had been quiet, keeping mostly to herself, harming no one. Afterward there had been made-up stories told about her, memories changing in retrospect (Harry knew well the research on that). But at the time,while she still attended school, the most talented witch in Hogwarts hadbeen known as a gentle girl (Professor Quirrell had said). Her few friendshad been surprised when she’d joined the Death Eaters, and more surprised that she’d been hiding so much darkness behind that sad, wistfulsmile.That was who Bellatrix had once been, the most promising witch ofher own generation, before the Dark Lord stole her and broke her, shattered her and reshaped her, binding her to him on a deeper level and withdarker arts than any Imperius.Ten years Bellatrix had served the Dark Lord, killing who he bade herkill, torturing who he bade her torture.And then the Dark Lord had finally been defeated.And Bellatrix’s nightmare had continued.Somewhere inside Bellatrix there might be something that was stillscreaming, that had been screaming the whole time, something a psychiatric Healer could bring back; or there might not be, Professor Quirrellhad no way of knowing. But either way, they could……they could at least get her out of Azkaban…Bellatrix Black had been put into the lowest level of Azkaban.Harry was having trouble not imagining what he would see when theygot to her cell. Bellatrix must have had almost no fear of death, in thebeginning, if she was still alive at all.They descended another flight of stairs, coming that much closer toDeath and Bellatrix, the clacking of their invisible shoes the only sound818 *that Harry could hear. Dim orange light coming from the gas lights, thefaint green spark drifting through the air, the shining figure followingwith its silver light fluctuating from time to time.After descending many times, they came in time to a corridor that did notend in stairs, and a final metal door, and the green spark halted before it.Harry’s heart had calmed a little, as they descended far into the depthsof Azkaban without anything happening. But now it was hammering hischest once more. They were at the bottom, and the shadows of Deathwere very close at hand.A soft metal click came from the lock, as Professor Quirrell openedthe way.Harry took a deep breath and remembered everything that ProfessorQuirrell had told him. The hard part wouldn’t just be getting the pretended personality right enough to fool Bellatrix Black herself, the hardpart would be keeping his Patronus going at the same time…The green spark winked out, and a moment later a meter-high snakeshimmered into existence, no longer invisible.The metal door moved with a slow creaking sound as Harry pushedon it with his invisible hand, opened it just a crack, and peered through.He saw a straight corridor that terminated in solid stone. There wasno light there but what crept in from Harry’s Patronus. That was brightenough for him to see the outer bars of the eight cells set into the corridor,but he couldn’t see the insides; more importantly, though, he didn’t seeanyone in the corridor itself.“I ssee nothing,” hissed Harry.The snake darted on ahead, swiftly twisting across the floor.A moment later—“Sshe iss alone,” hissed the snake.Stay, Harry thought to his Patronus, which took up a position just toone side of the door, as though guarding it; and then Harry pushed thedoor open further, and followed within.819 *The first cell Harry looked at contained a dessicated corpse, skin gonegrey and mottled, flesh worn through in places to expose the bone beneath, no eyes—Harry shut his eyes. He could still do that, he was still invisible, hewasn’t betraying anything by shutting his eyes.He’d known it already, he’d read it on page six of his Transfigurationbook, that you stayed in Azkaban until your prison term was done. If youdied before it was up they kept you there until they released your corpse.If your term was for life, they just left the body in the cell until the cell wasneeded, at which point they threw your body into the Dementors’ pit. Butit was still a shock to see, that corpse had been a person who’d just beenleft there—The light in the room wavered.Steady, thought Harry in his core. It wouldn’t be good for ProfessorQuirrell if that Patronus went out from his thinking sad thoughts. Thisnear to the Dementors the Defense Professor might just fall dead wherehe stood. Steady, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, steady!With that thought, Harry opened his eyes again, there wasn’t time towaste.The second cell he looked at contained only a skeleton.And behind the bars of the third cell he saw Bellatrix Black.Something precious and irreplaceable inside Harry withered like drygrass.You could tell the woman wasn’t a skeleton, that her head wasn’t askull, because the texture of skin was still different from the texture ofbone, no matter how white and pale she’d become, waiting in the darkalone. Either they weren’t feeding her much, or what she ate, the shadows of Death drained from her; for her eyes seemed shrunken below theirlids, her lips looked too shriveled to close over her teeth. The color seemedleached out of the black clothing she had worn into prison, like the Dementors had drained that too. They’d been meant to be daring, thoseclothes, and now they lay loosely over a skeleton, exposing shriveled skin.I’m here to save her, I’m here to save her, I’m here to save her, Harry thoughtto himself, desperately, over and over with an effort like Occlumency, will*820 *ing his Patronus not to go out, to stay and protect Bellatrix from the Dementors—In his heart, in his core, Harry held to all his pity and his compassion, his will to save her from the darkness; the silver radiance comingin through the open door brightened, even as he thought it.And in another part of him, like he was just letting another part of hismind carry out a habit without paying much attention to it…A cold expression came over Harry’s face, invisibly beneath the hood.“Hello, my dear Bella,” said a chill whisper. “Did you miss me?”he corpse of a woman opened her eyes, and the dull sunken orbsgazed out at nothing.“Mad,” Bellatrix muttered in a cracked voice, “It seems that little Bellais going mad…”Professor Quirrell had instructed Harry, calmly and precisely, howhe was to act in Bellatrix’s presence; how to form the pretense he wouldmaintain in his mind.You found it expedient, or perhaps just amusing, to make Bellatrix fall in lovewith you, to bind her to your service.That love would have persisted through Azkaban, Professor Quirrellhad said, because to Bellatrix it would not be a happy thought.She loves you utterly, completely, with her whole being. You do not return herlove, but consider her useful. She knows this.She was the deadliest weapon you possessed, and you called her your dearBella.Harry remembered it from the night the Dark Lord killed his parents:the cold amusement, the contemptuous laughter, that high-pitched voiceof deathly hate. It didn’t seem at all difficult to guess what the Dark Lordwould say.“I hope you are not mad, Bella dear,” said the chill whisper. “Mad isnot useful.”Bellatrix’s eyes flickered, tried to focus on empty air.823 *“My… Lord… I waited for you but you did not come… I looked for youbut I could not find you… you are alive…” All her words came out in a lowmutter, if there was emotion in it, Harry could not tell.“Sshow her your face,” hissed the snake at Harry’s feet.Harry cast back the hood of the Cloak of Invisibility.The part of him that Harry had placed in control of his facial expressions looked at Bella without the slightest trace of pity, only cool, calminterest. (While in his core, Harry thought, I will save you, I will save you nomatter what…)“The scar…” muttered Bellatrix. “That child…”“So they all still think,” said Harry’s voice, and gave a thin little chuckle.“You looked for me in the wrong place, Bella dear.”(Harry had asked why Professor Quirrell couldn’t be the one to playthe part of the Dark Lord, and Professor Quirrell had pointed out thatthere was no plausible reason for him to be possessed by the shade of HeWho-Must-Not-Be-Named.)Bellatrix’s eyes remained fixed on Harry, she said no word.“Ssay ssomething in Parsseltongue,” hissed the snake.Harry’s face turned to the snake, to make it clear that he was addressing it, and hissed, “One two three four ﬁve ssix sseven eight nine ten.”There was a pause.“Those who do not fear the darkness…” murmured Bellatrix.The snake hissed, “Will be conssumed by it.”“Will be consumed by it,” whispered the chill voice. Harry didn’t particularly want to think about how Professor Quirrell had gotten that password. His brain, which thought about it anyway, suggested that it hadprobably involved a Death Eater, a quiet isolated place, and some leadpipe Legilimency.“Your wand,” murmured Bellatrix, “I took it from the Potters’ houseand hid it, my lord… under the tombstone to the right of your father’sgrave… will you kill me, now, if that was all you wished of me… I think Imust have always wanted you to be the one to kill me… but I can’t remember now, it must have been a happy thought…”Harry’s heart wrenched inside him, it was unbearable, and—and hecouldn’t cry, couldn’t let his Patronus fade—824 *Harry’s face showed a flicker of annoyance, and his voice was sharp asit said, “Enough foolishness. You’re to come with me, Bella dear, unlessyou prefer the company of the Dementors.”Bellatrix’s face twitched in brief puzzlement, the shrunken limbs didnot stir.“You'll need to float her out,” Harry hissed to the snake. “Sshe can no longerthink of esscaping.”“Yess,” hissed the snake, “but do not underesstimate her, sshe wass the deadliesst of warriorss.” The green head dipped in warning. “One would be wisseto fear me, boy, even were I sstarved and nine-tenthss dead; be wary of her, allow nossingle flaw in your pretensse.”The green snake smoothly glided out of the door.And shortly after, a man with sallow skin and a fearful expression onhis bearded face cringed into the room with his wand in hand.“My Lord?” the servant said falteringly.“Do as you were instructed,” the Dark Lord whispered in that chillvoice, sounding even more terrible coming from a child’s body. “And donot let your Patronus falter. Remember, if I do not return there will be noreward for you, and it will be long before your family is allowed to die.”Having spoken those dreadful words, the Dark Lord pulled his invisibility cloak over his head, and disappeared.The cringing servant opened the door to Bellatrix’s cage, and pulleda tiny needle from his robes with which he poked the human skeleton.The single drop of red blood produced was soon absorbed into a smalldoll, which was laid upon the floor, and the servant began to chant in awhisper.Soon another living skeleton lay upon the floor, motionless. Afterward the servant seemed to hesitate for a moment, until from the emptyair hissed an impatient command. Then the servant pointed his wand atBellatrix and spoke a word, and the living skeleton lying on the bed wasnaked, and the skeleton lying on the floor was clothed in her faded dress.The servant tore a small strip of cloth from the dress, as it lay uponthe seeming corpse; and from his own robes, the fearful man then produced an empty glass flask with small traces of golden fluid clinging to825 *its inside. This flask was concealed in a corner, the strip of skirt laid overit, the leached cloth nearly blending with the gray metal wall.Another wave of the servant’s wand floated the human skeleton lyingon the bed into the air, and in almost the same motion clothed her in newblack robes. An ordinary-looking bottle of chocolate milk was put into herhand, and a chill whisper ordered Bellatrix to grasp the bottle and begindrinking it, which she did, her face still looking only puzzled.Then the servant turned Bellatrix invisible, and turned himself invisible, and they left. The door closed behind them all and clicked as itlocked, plunging the corridor into darkness once more, unchanged butfor a small flask concealed in the corner of one cell, and a fresh corpselying upon its floor.Earlier, in the deserted shop, Professor Quirrell had told Harry that theywere going to commit the perfect crime.Harry had unthinkingly started to repeat back the standard proverbthat there was no such thing as a perfect crime, before he actually thoughtabout it for two-thirds of a second, remembered a wiser proverb, and shuthis mouth in midsentence.What do you think you know, and how do you think you know it?If you did commit the perfect crime, nobody would ever find out—sohow could anyone possibly know that there weren’t perfect crimes?And as soon as you looked at it that way, you realized that perfectcrimes probably got committed all the time, and the coroner marked itdown as death by natural causes, or the newspaper reported that the shophad never been very profitable and had finally gone out of business…When Bellatrix Black’s corpse was found dead in her cell the nextmorning, there within the prison of Azkaban from which (everyoneknew) no one had ever escaped, nobody bothered doing an autopsy.Nobody thought twice about it. They just locked up the corridor and left,and the Daily Prophet reported it in the obituary column the next day……that was the perfect crime which Professor Quirrell had planned.And it wasn’t Professor Quirrell who screwed it up.826 *faint green spark moved forward to set the pace, and behind itfollowed a brilliant silver figure, all other entities invisible. Theyhad traversed five legs of corridor, turned right five times and gone upfive flights of stairs; and when Bellatrix had finished her second bottle ofchocolate milk, she had been given solid bars of chocolate to eat.It was after her third bar of chocolate that strange noises began tocome from Bellatrix’s throat.It took a moment for Harry to understand, to process the sounds, itdidn’t sound like anything he’d ever heard before; the rhythm of it wasshattered, almost unrecognizable, it took him that long to realize that Bellatrix was crying.Bellatrix Black was crying, the Dark Lord’s most terrible weapon wascrying, she was invisible but you could hear it, tiny pathetic sounds shewas trying to suppress, even now.“It’s real?” said Bellatrix. Tonality had returned into her voice, nolonger a dead mutter, it rose up at the end to form the question. “It’sreal?”Yes, thought the part of Harry simulating the Dark Lord, now besilent—He couldn’t make those words pass his lips, he just couldn’t.“I knew—you would—come to me—someday,” Bellatrix’s voice quavered and fractured as she drew breath for quiet sobs, “I knew—you werealive—that you would come—to me—my Lord…” there was a long inhalation like a huge gasp, “and that even—when you came—you still wouldn’t827 *love me—never—you would never love me back—that was why—theycouldn’t take—my love from me—even though I can’t remember—can’tremember so many other things—though I don’t know what I forgot—but I remember how much I love you, Lord—”There was a knife stabbing through Harry’s heart, he’d never heardanything so terrible, he wanted to hunt down the Dark Lord and kill himjust for this…“Do you still—have use for me—my Lord?”“No,” hissed Harry’s voice, without him even thinking, it just seemedto be operating on automatic, “I entered Azkaban on a whim. Of course Ihave use for you! Don’t ask foolish questions.”“But—I’m weak,” said Bellatrix’s voice, and a full sob escaped her, itsounded much too loud in the corridors of Azkaban, “I can’t kill for you,my Lord, I’m sorry, they ate it all, ate me all up, I’m too weak to fight, whatgood am I to you now—”Harry’s brain cast about desperately for some way to reassure her,from the lips of a Dark Lord who would never speak a single word of caring.“Ugly,” said Bellatrix. Her voice said that word like it was the finalnail in her coffin, the last despair. “I’m ugly, they ate that too, I’m, I’mnot pretty any more, you won’t even, be able, to use me, as a reward, foryour servants—even the Lestranges, won’t want, to hurt me, any more—”The brilliant silver figure stopped walking.Because Harry had stopped walking.The Dark Lord, he… The part of Harry’s self that was soft and vulnerablewas screaming in disbelieving horror, trying to reject reality, refuse theunderstanding, even as a colder and harder part completed the pattern:She obeyed him in that as she obeyed him in all things.The green spark bobbed urgently, darted forward.The silver humanoid stayed in place.Bellatrix was sobbing harder.“I’m, I’m not, I can’t be, useful, any more…”Giant hands were squeezing Harry’s chest, wringing him like a washcloth, trying to crush his heart.828 *“Please,” whispered Bellatrix, “just kill me…” Her voice seemed tocalm, once she said that. “Please Lord, kill me, I’ve no reason to live if I’mno use to you… I only want it to stop… please hurt me one last time, myLord, hurt me until I stop… I love you…”It was the saddest thing Harry had ever heard.The bright silver shape of Harry’s Patronus flickered—Wavered—Brightened—The fury that was rising in Harry, his rage against the Dark Lord whohad done this, the rage against the Dementors, against Azkaban, againstthe world that allowed such horror, it all seemed to be pouring straightthrough his arm and into his wand without there being any way of blocking it, he tried willing it to stop and nothing happened.“My Lord!” whispered the disguised voice of Professor Quirrell. “Myspell is going out of control! Help me, my Lord!”Brighter the Patronus, brighter and brighter, it was waxing fasterthan on the day that Harry had destroyed a Dementor.“My Lord!” the silhouette said in a terrified whisper. “Help me! Everyone will feel it, my Lord!”Everyone will feel it, thought Harry. His imagination could picture itclearly, the prisoners in their cells stirring as the cold and darkness fellaway, replaced by healing light.Every exposed surface now burned like a white sun in the reflections,the silhouette of Bellatrix’s skeleton and the sallow man now clearly visible in the blaze, the Disillusionment spells unable to keep pace with theunearthly brilliance; only the Cloak of Invisibility out of the Deathly Hallows withstood it.“My Lord! You must stop it!”But Harry could no longer will it to stop, he no longer wanted it to stop.He could sense it, more and more of the sparks of life in Azkaban beingsheltered by his Patronus, as it unfolded like spreading wings of sunlight, theair turned to absolute silver as he thought it, Harry knew what he had to do.“Please, my Lord!”The words went unheard.829 *They were far from him, the Dementors in their pit, but Harry knew that theycould be destroyed even at this distance if the light blazed bright enough, he knewthat Death itself could not face him if he stopped holding back, so he unsealed allthe gates inside him and sank the wells of his spell into all the deepest parts ofhis spirit, all his mind and all his will, and gave over absolutely everything to thespell—And in the interior of the Sun, an only slightly dimmer shadow movedforward, reaching out an entreating hand.The sudden sense of doom clashed with Harry’s steel determination,dread and uncertainty striving against the bright purpose, nothing elsemight have reached him but that. The silhouette took another step forward and another, the sense of doom rising to a point of terrible catastrophe; and in the drench of cold water, Harry saw it, he realized the consequences of what he was doing, the danger and the trap.If you had been watching from outside you would have seen the interior of the Sun brightening and dimming…Brightening and dimming……and finally fading, fading, fading into ordinary moonlight thatseemed like pitch darkness by contrast.Within the darkness of that moonlight stood a sallow man with hishand outstretched in entreaty, and the skeleton of a woman, lying uponthe floor, a puzzled look upon her face.And Harry, still invisible, fallen to his knees. The greater dangerhad passed, and now Harry was just trying not to collapse, to keep thespell going at the lower level. He’d drained something, hopefully not lostsomething—he should have known, should have remembered, that itwasn’t mere magic that fueled the Patronus Charm—“Thank you, my Lord,” whispered the sallow man.“Fool,” said the hard voice of a boy pretending to be a Dark Lord. “DidI not warn you that the spell could prove fatal if you failed to control youremotions?”Professor Quirrell’s eyes did not widen, of course.“Yes, my Lord, I understand,” said the Dark Lord’s servant in a faltering voice, and turned to Bellatrix—She was already pushing herself off the floor, slowly, like an old, oldMuggle woman. “How funny,” Bellatrix whispered, “you were almostkilled by a Patronus Charm…” A giggle that sounded like it was blowingdust out of her giggle pipes. “I could punish you, maybe, if my Lord frozeyou in place and I had knives… maybe I can be useful after all? Oh, I feela little better now, how strange…”“Be silent, dear Bella,” Harry said in a chill voice, “until I give you leaveto speak.”There was no reply, which was obedience.The servant levitated the human skeleton, and made her invisibleonce more, followed shortly by his own disappearance with the sound ofanother cracking egg.They passed on through the corridors of Azkaban.And Harry knew that as they passed, the prisoners were stirring intheir cells as the fear lifted for one precious moment, maybe even feelinga small touch of healing as his light passed them by, and then collapsingdown again as the cold and darkness pressed back in.Harry was trying very hard not to think about it.Otherwise his Patronus would wax until it burned away every Dementor in Azkaban, blazing bright enough to destroy them even at this distance…Otherwise his Patronus would wax until it burned away every Dementor in Azkaban, taking all of Harry’s life as fuel.In the Auror’s quarters at the top of Azkaban, one Auror trio was snoringin the barracks, one Auror trio was resting in the breakroom, and one Auror trio was on duty in the command room, keeping their watch. The command room was simple but large, with three chairs at back where threeAurors sat, their wands always in hand to sustain their three Patronuses,as the bright white forms paced in front of the open window, shelteringthem all from the Dementors’ fear.The three of them usually stuck to the back, and played poker, anddidn’t look out the window. You could have seen some sky there, sure, andthere was even an hour or two every day where you could’ve seen somesun, but that window also looked down on the central pit of hell.Just in case a Dementor wanted to float up and talk to you.There was no way that Auror Li would have agreed to serve duty here,triple pay or no triple pay, if he hadn’t had a family to support. (His realname was Xiaoguang, and everyone called him Mike instead; he’d namedhis children Su and Kao, which hopefully would serve them better.) Hisonly consolation, besides the money, was that at least his mates played anexcellent game of Dragon Poker. Though it would be hard not to, at thispoint.It was their 5,366th game and Li had what would probably be his besthand of the 5300s. It was a Saturday in February and there were threeplayers, which let him shift the suit of any one hole card except a two,three, or seven; and that was enough to let him build a Corps-a-Corpswith Unicorns, Dragons, and sevens…Across the table from him, Gerard McCusker looked up from the tablecards toward the direction of the window, staring.The sinking feeling came over Li’s stomach with surprising speed.If his seven of hearts got hit by a Dementor Modifier and turned intoa six, he was going straight down to two pair and McCusker might beatthat—“Mike,” said McCusker, “what’s with your Patronus?”Li turned his head and looked.His soft silver badger had turned away from its watch over the pit andwas staring downward at something only it could see.A moment later, Bahry’s moonlit duck and McCusker’s brightanteater followed suit, staring in the same downward direction.They all exchanged glances, and then sighed.“I’ll tell them,” said Bahry. Protocol called for sending the three Aurorswho were off-duty but not sleeping to investigate anything anomalous.“Maybe relieve one of them and take the C spiral, if you two don’t mind.”832 *Li exchanged a glance with McCusker, and they both nodded. Itwasn’t too hard to break into Azkaban, if you were wealthy enough tohire a powerful wizard, and well-intentioned enough to recruit someonewho could cast the Patronus Charm. People with friends in Azkabanwould do that, break in just to give someone a half-day’s worth of Patronus time, a chance at some real dreams instead of nightmares. Leavethem a supply of chocolate to conceal in their cell, to increase the chancethey lived through their sentence. And the Aurors on guard… well, evenif you got caught, you could probably convince the Aurors to overlook it,in exchange for the right bribe.For Li, the right bribe tended to be in the range of two Knuts and asilver Sickle. He hated this place.But Bahry One-Hand had a wife and the wife had healer’s bills, andif you could afford to hire someone who could break into Azkaban, thenyou could afford to grease Bahry’s remaining palm pretty hard, if he wasthe one who caught you.By unspoken agreement, none of them giving anything away by beingthe first to propose it, the three of them finished out their poker handfirst. Li won, since no Dementors had actually shown up. And by thenthe Patronuses had stopped staring and gone back to their normal patrol,so it was probably nothing, but procedure was procedure.After Li raked in the pot, Bahry gave them all formal nods, and stoodup from the table. The older man’s long white locks brushed against hisfancy red robes, his robes brushed the metal floor of the command room,as Bahry went through the separating door that led to the formerly offduty Aurors.Li had been Sorted into Hufflepuff, and he sometimes felt a littlequeasy about this kind of business. But Bahry had shown them all thepictures, and you had to let a man do what he could for his poor sick wife,especially when he only had seven months left before his retirement.833 *The faint green spark floated through the metal corridors, and the silverhumanoid, seeming a little dimmer now, followed after it. Sometimesthe bright figure would flare, especially when they passed one of the hugemetal doors, but it always died back down again.Mere eyes could not have seen the invisible others: the eleven-yearold Boy-Who-Lived, and the living skeleton that was Bellatrix Black, andthe Polyjuiced Defense Professor of Hogwarts, all traveling togetherthrough Azkaban. If that was the beginning of a joke, Harry didn’t knowthe punchline.They’d gone up another four flights of stairs before the rough voiceof the Defense Professor said, simply and without emphasis, “Auror coming.”It took too long, a whole second maybe, for Harry to understand, forthe jolt of adrenaline to pump into his blood, and for him to rememberwhat Professor Quirrell had already discussed with him and told him todo in this case, and then Harry spun on his heel and flew back the waythey’d come.Harry reached the flight of stairs, and frantically laid himself downon the third step from the top, the cold metal feeling hard even throughhis cloak and robes. Trying to move his head up, to peer over the lip ofthe stairs, showed that he couldn’t see Professor Quirrell; and that meantthat Harry was out of the line of any stray fire.His shining Patronus followed after him, and lay down beside him onthe step just beneath him; for it too must not be seen.There was a faint sound as of wind or whooshing, and then the soundof Bellatrix’s invisible body coming to rest on a stair further below, shehad no place in this except—“Stay still,” said the cold high whisper, “stay silent.”There was stillness, and silence.Harry pressed his wand against the side of the metal step just abovehim. If he was anyone else he would have needed to take a Knut out ofhis pocket… or rip off a bit of cloth from his robe… or bite off one of hisnails… or find a speck of rock large enough that he could see it and solidenough to stay in one place and orientation while it touched his wand.But with Harry’s almighty power of partial Transfiguration, this was not834 *necessary; he could skip that particular step of the operation and use anymaterial near to hand.Thirty seconds later Harry was the proud new owner of a curved mirror, and…“Wingardium Leviosa,” Harry whispered as quietly as he could.…was levitating it just above the steps, and watching, in that curvedsurface, almost the whole corridor where Professor Quirrell invisiblywaited.Harry heard it in the distance, then, the sound of footsteps.And saw the form (a little hard to see in the mirror) of a person in redrobes, coming down the stairs, entering the seemingly empty corridor;accompanied by a small Patronus animal that Harry couldn’t quite makeout.The Auror was protected by a blue shimmer, it was hard to see the details but Harry could see that much, the Auror had shields already raisedand strengthened.Crap, thought Harry. According to the Defense Professor, the essential art of dueling consisted of trying to put up defenses that would blockwhatever someone was likely to throw at you, while trying in turn to attack in ways that were likely to go past their current set of defenses. Andby far the easiest way to win any sort of real fight—Professor Quirrellhad said this over and over—was to shoot the enemy before they raised ashield in the first place, either from behind or from close enough rangethat they couldn’t dodge or counter in time.Though Professor Quirrell might still be able to get in a shot from behind, if—But the Auror halted after taking three steps into the corridor.“Nice Disillusionment,” said a hard male voice that Harry didn’t recognize. “Now show yourself, or you’ll be in real trouble.”The form of the sallow, bearded man became visible then.“And you with the Patronus,” said the hard voice. “Come out too.Now.”“Wouldn’t be smart,” said the gravelly voice of the sallow man. It wasno longer the terrified voice of the Dark Lord’s servant; it had suddenly become the professional intimidation of a competent criminal. “You don’t835 *want to see who’s behind me. Trust me, you don’t. Five hundred Galleons,cold cash up front, if you turn around and walk away. Big trouble for yourcareer if you don’t.”There was a long pause.“Look, whoever you are,” said the hard voice. “You seem confusedabout how this works. I don’t care if that’s Lucius Malfoy behind you orAlbus bloody Dumbledore. You all come out, I scan the whole lot of you,and then we talk about how much this is going to cost you—”“Two thousand Galleons, final offer,” said the gravelly voice, takingon a warning undertone. “That’s ten times the going rate and more thanyou make in a year. And believe me, if you see something you shouldn’t,you’re going to regret not taking that—”“Shut it!” said the hard voice. “You’ve got exactly five seconds to dropthat wand before I drop you. Five, four—”What are you doing, Professor Quirrell? Harry thought frantically. Attackfirst! Cast a shield at least!“—three, two, one! Stupefy!”Bahry stared, a chill running down his spine.The man’s wand had moved so fast that it was like it had Apparatedinto place, and Bahry’s stunner was currently sparkling tamely at the endof it, not blocked, not countered, not deflected, caught like a fly in honey.“My offer has gone back down to five hundred Galleons,” said the manin a colder, more formal voice. He smiled dryly, and the smile lookedwrong on that bearded face. “And you shall need to accept a MemoryCharm.”Bahry had already swapped the harmonics on his shields so that hisown stunner couldn’t pass back through, already tilted his wand backinto a defensive position, already raised his hardened artificial hand intoposition to block anything blockable, and was already thinking wordlessspells to put more layers on his shields—836 *The man wasn’t looking at Bahry. Instead he was poking curiously atBahry’s stunner where it still wavered on the end of his wand, drawingout red sparks and flicking them away with his fingers, slowly disassembling the hex like a child’s rod puzzle.The man hadn’t raised any shields of his own.“Tell me,” the man said in a disinterested voice that didn’t seem toquite fit the rough throat—Polyjuice, Bahry would have called it, if he’dthought that anyone could possibly do magic that delicate from insidesomeone else’s body—“what did you do in the last war? Put yourself inharm’s way, or stay out of trouble?”“Harm’s way,” said Bahry. His voice kept the iron calm of an Aurorwith nearly a hundred full years on the force, seven months short ofmandatory retirement, Mad-Eye Moody couldn’t have said it with anymore hardness.“Fight any Death Eaters?”Now a grim smile graced Bahry’s own face. “Two at once.” Two ofYou-Know-Who’s own warrior-assassins, personally trained by their darkmaster. Two Death Eaters at once against Bahry alone. It had been thetoughest fight of Bahry’s life, but he’d stood his ground, and walked awaywith only the loss of his left hand.“Did you kill them?” The man sounded idly curious, and he continuedto draw threads of fire out of the much-diminished stunbolt still captiveon the end of his wand, his fingers now weaving small patterns of Bahry’sown magic before flicking to disperse them.Sweat broke out on Bahry’s skin beneath his robes. His metal handflashed downward, ripped the mirror from his belt—“Bahry to Mike, Ineed backup!”There was a pause, and silence.“Bahry to Mike!”The mirror lay dull and lifeless in his hand. Slowly, Bahry put it backon his belt.“It’s been quite a while since I had a serious fight with a serious opponent,” the man said, still not looking up at Bahry. “Try not to disappointme too much. You can attack whenever you’re ready. Or you can walkaway with five hundred Galleons.”837 *There was a long silence.Then the air screamed like metal cutting glass as Bahry slashed hiswand downward.Harry could hardly see it, could hardly make out anything amid the lightsand flashes, his mirror’s curve was perfect (they’d practiced that tacticbefore in the Chaos Legion) but the scene was still too small, and Harryhad the feeling he wouldn’t be able to understand even if he was watching from a meter away, it was all happening too fast, red blasts deflectingfrom blue shields, green bars of light clashing together, shadowy formsappearing and vanishing, he couldn’t even tell who was casting what, except that the Auror was shouting incantation after incantation and frantically dodging while Professor Quirrell’s Polyjuiced form stood in oneplace and flicked his wand, mostly silently, but now and then pronouncing words in unrecognizable languages that would white out the wholemirror and show half the Auror’s shielding torn away as he staggeredback.Harry had seen exhibition duels between the strongest seventh-yearstudents, and this was so far above it that Harry’s mind felt numbed, looking at how far he had left to go. There wasn’t a single seventh-year studentwho could have lasted half a minute against the Auror, all three seventhyear armies put together might not be able to scratch the Defense Professor…The Auror had fallen to the ground, one knee and one hand supporting himself as the other hand gestured frantically and his mouthshouted desperate words, the few incantations that Harry recognizedwere all shield spells, as a flock of shadows spun around the Auror like awhirlwind of razors.And Harry saw Professor Quirrell’s Polyjuiced form deliberately pointhis wand at where the Auror kneeled and fought the last moments of hisbattle.“Surrender,” said the gravelly voice.The Auror spat something unspeakable.838 *“In that case,” said the voice, “Avada—”Time seemed to move very slowly, like there was time to hear the individual syllables, Ke, and Da, and Vra, time to watch the Auror starting tothrow himself desperately aside; and even though it was all happening soslowly, somehow there wasn’t time to do anything, no time for Harry toopen his lips and scream NO, no time to move, maybe even not any timeto think.Only time for one desperate wish that an innocent man should notdie—And a blazing silver figure stood before the Auror.Stood there just a fraction of a second before the green light struckhome.Bahry was twisting frantically aside, not knowing if he was going to makeit—His eyes were focused on his opponent and his onrushing death, soBahry only briefly saw the outline of the brilliant silhouette, the Patronusbrighter than any he’d ever seen, saw it just barely long enough to recognize the impossible shape, before the green and the silver light collidedand both lights vanished, both lights vanished, the Killing Curse had beenblocked, and then Bahry’s ears were pierced as he saw his terrible opponent screaming, screaming, screaming, clutching at his head and screaming, starting to fall as Bahry was already falling—Bahry hit the ground, falling from his own frantic lunge, and his dislocated left shoulder and broken rib screamed in protest. Bahry ignoredthe pain, managed to scramble back to his knees, brought up his wandto stun his opponent, he didn’t understand what was happening but heknew that this was his only chance.“Stupefy!”The red bolt struck out toward the man’s falling body, and was tornapart in midair and dissipated—and not by any shield. Bahry could see it,the wavering in the air that surrounded his fallen and screaming opponent.839 *Bahry could feel it like a deadly pressure on his skin, the flux of magicbuilding and building and building toward some terrible breaking point.His instincts screamed at him to run before the explosion came, this wasno Charm, no Curse, this was wizardry run wild, but before Bahry couldeven finish getting to his feet—The man threw his wand away from himself (he threw away hiswand!) and a second later, his form blurred and vanished entirely.A green snake lay motionless on the ground, unmoving even beforeBahry’s next stunner spell, fired in sheer reflex, hit it without resistance.As the dreadful flux and pressure began to dissipate, as the wild wizardry died back down, Bahry’s dazed mind noticed that the scream wascontinuing. Only it sounded different, like the scream of a young boy,coming from the stairs leading down to the next lower level.That scream choked off too, and then there was silence except forBahry’s frantic panting.His thoughts were slow, confused, disarrayed. His opponent hadbeen insanely powerful, that hadn’t been a duel, it had been like his firstyear as a trainee Auror trying to fight Madam Tarma. The Death-Eatershadn’t been a tenth that good, Mad-Eye Moody wasn’t that good… andwho, what, how in the name of Merlin’s balls had anyone blocked a KillingCurse?Bahry managed to summon the energy to press his wand against hisrib, mutter the healing spell, and then press it again to his shoulder. Ittook more out of him than it should have, took far too much out of him,his magic was within a bare breath of utter exhaustion; he didn’t haveanything left for his minor cuts and bruises or even to reinforce the scrapsleft of his shielding. It was all he could do not to let his Patronus go out.Bahry breathed deeply, heavily, steadied his breath as much as hecould before he spoke.“You,” Bahry said. “Whoever you are. Come out.”There was silence, and it occurred to Bahry that whoever it was mightbe unconscious. He didn’t understand what had just happened, but he’dheard the scream…Well, there was one way to test that.“Come out,” said Bahry, making his voice harder, “or I start using areaeffect curses.” He probably couldn’t have managed one if he’d tried.“Wait,” said a boy’s voice, a young boy’s voice, high and thin and wavering, like someone was holding back exhaustion or tears. The voice nowseemed to be coming from closer to hand. “Please wait. I’m—comingout—”“Drop the invisibility,” growled Bahry. He was too tired to bother withanti-Disillusionment Charms.A moment later, a young boy’s face emerged from within an unfoldinginvisibility cloak, and Bahry saw the black hair, the green eyes, the glasses,and the angry red lightning-bolt scar.If he’d had twenty fewer years of experience under his belt he mighthave blinked. Instead he just spat something that he probably shouldn’tought to say in front of the Boy-Who-Lived.“He, he,” the boy’s wavering voice said, his young face looked frightened and exhausted and tears were still trickling down his cheeks, “hekidnapped me, to make me cast my Patronus… he said he’d kill me if Ididn’t… only I couldn’t let him just kill you…”Bahry’s mind was still dazed, but things were slowly starting to clickinto place.Harry Potter, the only wizard ever to survive a Killing Curse. Bahrymight have been able to dodge the green death, he’d certainly been trying,but if the matter came up before the Wizengamot, they’d rule it was a lifedebt to a Noble House.“I see,” Bahry said in a much gentler growl. He started to walk towardthe boy. “Son, I’m sorry for what you’ve been through, but I need you todrop the cloak and drop your wand.”The rest of Harry Potter emerged from invisibility, showing the sweatsoaked blue-trimmed Hogwarts robes, and his right hand clutching aneleven-inch holly wand so hard his knuckles were white.“Your wand,” Bahry repeated.“Sorry,” whispered the eleven-year-old boy, “here,” and he held out thewand toward Bahry.Bahry barely stopped himself from snarling at the traumatized boywho’d just saved his life. Instead he overrode the impulse with a sigh,and just stretched out a hand to take the wand. “Look, son, you’re reallynot supposed to point a wand at—”The wand’s end twisted lightly beneath Bahry’s hand just as the boywhispered, “Somnium.”Harry stared at the Auror’s crumpled body, there was no sense of triumph,just a crushing sense of despair.(Even then it might not have been too late.)Harry turned to look at where the green snake lay motionless.“Teacher?” hissed Harry. “Friend? Pleasse, are you alive?” An awful fearwas taking hold in Harry’s heart; in that moment he had entirely forgotten that he’d just seen the Defense Professor try to kill a police officer.Harry pointed his wand at the snake, and his lips even began to shapethe word Innervate, before his brain caught up with him and screamed athim.He didn’t dare use magic on Professor Quirrell.Harry had felt it, the burning, tearing pain in his head, like his brainwas about to split in half. He’d felt it, his magic and Professor Quirrell’smagic, matched and anti-harmonized in a fulfillment of doom. That wasthe mysterious terrible thing that would happen if Harry and ProfessorQuirrell ever got too close to each other, or if they ever cast magic oneach other, or if their spells ever touched, their magic would resonate outof control—Harry stared at the snake, he couldn’t tell if it was breathing.(The last seconds ticked away.)He turned to stare at the Auror, who had seen the Boy-Who-Lived,who knew.The full magnitude of the disaster crushed in on Harry like a thousandhundred-ton weights, he’d managed to stun the Auror but now there wasnothing left to do, no way to recover, the mission had failed, everythinghad failed, he had failed.842 *Shocked, dismayed, despairing, he didn’t think of it, didn’t see the obvious, didn’t remember where the hopeless feelings were coming from,didn’t realize that he still needed to recast the True Patronus Charm.(And then it was already too late.)Auror Li and Auror McCusker had rearranged their chairs around the table, and so they both saw it at the same time, the naked, skeletally thinhorror rising up to hover outside the window, the headache already hitting them from seeing it.They both heard the voice, like a long-dead corpse had spoken wordsand those words themselves had aged and died.The Dementor’s speech hurt their ears as it said, “Bellatrix Black is outof her cell.”There was a split second of horrified silence, and then Li tore out of hischair, heading for the communicator to call in reinforcements from theMinistry, even as McCusker grabbed his mirror and started franticallytrying to raise the three Aurors who’d gone on patrol.843 *n a scarred and ruined corridor, lit by dim gas lights, a boy slowly creptforward, one hand stretched out, toward the unmoving snake thatwas the body of his teacher.Harry was only a meter away from the snake’s body when he first feltit, tickling at the edge of his perception.Ever so weakly, a sense of doom…Professor Quirrell was alive, then.The thought engendered no feeling of joy, only a sort of empty despair.Harry would still be caught soon, and no matter how he tried to explain, it still wouldn’t look good. No one would trust him again, theywould think he was the next Dark Lord, they wouldn’t help him whenit came time to fight Lord Voldemort, Hermione would give up on him,probably even Dumbledore would look for another hero……maybe they’d just send him home to his parents.He had failed.Harry looked at the crumpled body of the police officer he’d stunned,the already-drying blood from the minor cuts and slashes, the burnedplaces on the intricately embroidered red robes.He’d been stupid. He shouldn’t have stunned the police officer, shouldhave just stayed with his original story about being kidnapped by Professor Quirrell…It might not be too late, whispered a voice inside him. You might still beable to fix your mistake. The Auror saw you, he remembers that you stunned him…845 *but if he were dead, if Professor Quirrell were dead, if Bellatrix were dead, therewould be no one to contradict your story.Slowly, Harry’s hand started to rise, pointing his wand at the policeofficer and—Harry’s hand halted.He had a distant sense he was behaving uncharacteristically of himself, somehow. Like there was something he’d forgotten, something important, but he was having trouble remembering what it was, exactly.Oh. That was right. He was someone who believed in the value ofhuman life.A sense of puzzlement accompanied the thought, he couldn’t quiteremember why other people’s lives had seemed valuable…All right, said the logical part of him, why has my mind changed betweenthen and now?Because he was in Azkaban…And he’d forgotten to recast the Patronus Charm…Doing anything at all, somehow, seemed like a tremendous effort, likethe thought of action itself was a weight too heavy to lift; but it did seemlike a good idea to recast the Patronus Charm, for he was still able to beafraid of Dementors. And though he couldn’t remember what it was liketo be happy, he knew that this wasn’t it.Harry’s hand rose to hold his wand level before him, his fingers tookthe starting positions.And then Harry paused.He couldn’t… quite remember… what he’d used as his happy thought.That was odd, it had been something very important, he really oughtto be able to remember it… something to do with death? But that wasn’thappy…His body was shivering, Azkaban hadn’t seemed so cold before, andit seemed to be getting colder even as he thought. It was too late for him,he’d already sunk too far, he’d never be able to cast the Patronus Charmnow—That may be the Dementation talking rather than an accurate estimate, observed the logical part of himself, habits that had been encoded into sheer846 *reflex, requiring no energy to activate. Think of the Dementors’ fear as a cognitive bias, and try to overcome it the way you would overcome any other cognitivebias. Your hopeless feelings may not indicate that the situation is actually hopeless. It may only indicate that you are in the presence of Dementors. All negativeemotions and pessimistic estimates must now be considered suspect, fallacious until proven valid.(If you’d been watching the boy as he thought, you would have seen adistant, abstract, puzzled frown move across his face, below the glassesand the lightning-bolt scar. His hand stayed in the starting position forthe Patronus Charm, and did not move.)The presence of Dementors interferes with the part of you that processes happiness. If you cannot retrieve your happy thought by mnemonic association onthe key of happiness, perhaps you can get at the memory some other way instead.When was the last time you talked to someone about the Patronus Charm?Harry couldn’t seem to remember that either.A crushing wave of despair swept over him, and was dismissed bythe logical part of himself as untrustworthy, external, not-Harry, the dullweight still pressed him down but his mind went on thinking, it didn’ttake much effort to think…When was the last time you talked to someone about Dementors?Professor Quirrell had said that he was already able to feel the presence of Dementors, and Harry had said to Professor Quirrell… he’d toldProfessor Quirrell……to hold to the memory of the stars, of falling bodilessly throughspace, like an Occlumency barrier across his entire mind.His second Defense class of the year, on Friday, that was when Professor Quirrell had shown him the stars, and again on Christmas.It didn’t take much effort to remember them, the searing points ofwhite against perfect blackness.Harry remembered the great cloudy wash of the Milky Way.Harry remembered the peace.Some of the coldness at the fringes of his limbs seemed to retreat.There were words he had spoken out loud on the day he’d first cast thePatronus Charm, his mind could remember the sounds and the speecheven as the feelings seemed distant…847 *…I thought of my absolute rejection of death as the natural order.You cast the True Patronus Charm by thinking about the value of human life.…But there are other lives that are still alive to be fought for. Your life, and mylife, and Hermione Granger’s life, all the lives of Earth, and all the lives beyond,to be defended and protected.Then the idea of killing everyone… that hadn’t been his true self, thathad been the Dementation talking…Despair was the Dementors’ influence.Where there’s life, there’s hope. The Auror is still alive. Professor Quirrell isstill alive. Bellatrix is still alive. I’m still alive. No one’s actually died yet…Harry could picture the Earth, now, in the midst of the starfield, theblue-white orb.…and I won’t let them!“Expecto Patronum!”The words came out a little halting, and when the human shape burstback into existence it was dim at first, moonlight instead of sunlight,white instead of silver.But it strengthened, slowly, as Harry breathed in deliberate rhythm,recovering. Letting the light drive back the darkness from his mind.Remembering the things that he had almost forgotten, and channelingthem back into the Patronus Charm.Even when the light blazed full and silver once more, illuminatingthe corridor more brightly than the gas lamps, banishing fully the cold,Harry’s limbs still shook. That had been too close.Harry took a deep breath. All right. It was time to reconsider the situation now that his thoughts were no longer being artificially darkenedby Dementors.Harry reviewed the situation.…still looked pretty hopeless, actually.It wasn’t the crushing despair of before, but Harry still felt wobbly, toput it mildly. He didn’t dare go dark and it was his dark side that hadthe ability to take this level of problem in stride. It was his dark side thatwould have laughed scornfully at the very concept of giving up just because he’d lost Professor Quirrell and was marooned in the depths of Azk*848 *aban and had been seen by a police officer. The ordinary Harry was notable to take that sort of thing in stride.But there wasn’t any option except to keep moving forward anyway.You couldn’t get any more pointless than giving up before you’d actuallylost.Harry looked around.Dim gas lights lit a corridor of grey metal, whose sides and floor andceiling were slashed in places, gouged and melted, telling anyone whocared to look that there had been battle here.Professor Quirrell could have repaired it easily enough, if he’d…The sense of betrayal struck Harry with full force, then.Why… why did he… why…Because he’s evil, said Gryffindor and Hufflepuff, quietly and sadly. Wetold you so.No! thought Harry desperately. No, it doesn’t make sense, we were goingto commit the perfect crime, the Auror could have been Obliviated, the corridorrepaired, it wasn’t too late but it would have BEEN too late if he’d died!But Professor Quirrell was never really planning to commit the perfect crime,said the grim voice of Slytherin. He wanted the crime to be noticed. Hewanted everyone to know that someone had killed an Auror and broken Bellatrix Black out of Azkaban. He would have prepared some kind of evidence, someproof he could reveal of your involvement, to use as blackmail against you; andyou would have been bound to him forever.Harry’s Patronus almost went out, then.No… Harry thought.Yes, said the other three parts of him sadly.No. It still doesn’t make sense. Professor Quirrell had to know I would turnagainst him the instant I saw him kill an Auror. That I might very well go aheadand confess to Dumbledore, hoping to plead the true fact that I was tricked. And…in terms of blackmail, does his killing an Auror against my will, really add all thatmuch to breaking Bellatrix out of Azkaban with my willing help? It would havebeen more cunning to keep the evidence of my involvement with the basic crime,but still pretend to be my ally for as long as he could, saving the blackmail to useonly if it became necessary…Rationalization, said Slytherin. So why did Professor Quirrell do it, then?849 *And Harry thought with a tinge of desperation—knowing, even as hethought it, that he was motivated in part by a desire to reject reality, andthat wasn’t how the technique was meant to be wielded—I notice that I amconfused.There was internal silence. None of the parts of himself seemed tohave anything to add to that.And Harry continued to take stock of the moderately hopelesslooking situation.Did Harry need to re-evaluate the probability that Bellatrix was evil?…not in any mission-relevant sense. It was a given that Bellatrix wascurrently evil. Whether she was an innocent who’d been made that wayby torture and Legilimency and unspeakable rituals, or whether she’d chosen it of her own will, didn’t have much bearing on the current situation.The key fact was that while Bellatrix thought Harry was the Dark Lord,she would obey him.That was one resource, then. But Bellatrix was starved and ninetenths dead…‘Oh, I feel a little better now, how strange…’Bellatrix had said that, in her shattered voice, after Harry’s Patronushad blazed out of control.Harry thought, and he couldn’t have quite said why he thought this,it might have just been his own mind making things up, but… it seemedlikely that what the Dementors had taken from you long ago was lost forever. But what the Dementors had taken from you recently, the True Patronus Charm might give back. Like the difference between emptyinga cup, and the unused cup fading away. Bellatrix, then, might have gotback what she’d lost in just the last week or so. Not any happy memories,those would have been eaten years ago. But whatever strength and magichad been drained from her in just the last week, she might have regained.Like the equivalent of getting a week of rest, a week to build up her magicagain…Harry looked at Professor Quirrell’s snake form.…maybe enough for an Innervate.If awakening Professor Quirrell was, in fact, a smart thing to do.850 *Some of the despair came back to Harry, then. He couldn’t trust Professor Quirrell, couldn’t trust that reviving him would be wise, not afterwhat had just happened.Steady, Harry thought to himself, and looked at the crumpled form ofthe Auror.Bellatrix might also be able to manage a Memory Charm.That could be step one, anyway. It wasn’t exactly getting everyonesafely out of Azkaban, and the Aurors would know afterward that something strange had happened, they might suspect Bellatrix’s body and perform an autopsy. But it was a step.…and would it be all that hard to get out of Azkaban? If they couldget to the top of Azkaban quickly enough, before the Auror was supposedto report back in, before anyone noticed him missing, then they couldjust fly out through the hole Professor Quirrell had made, and get farenough away from Azkaban to activate the portkey Harry already hadin his possession. (Both Professor Quirrell and Harry had portkeys, andboth were powerful enough to transport two humans, plus or minus asnake. As with their doubly-concealed departure from Mary’s Room, Professor Quirrell had put enough safety margin in his plans to impress evenHarry.)Bellatrix could carry Professor Quirrell’s snake form, which Harrydared not touch or levitate.Harry turned and strode quickly toward where Bellatrix was waitingon the stairs. He could feel his spirits reviving a little. It was starting tolook like a good plan, and there was no time to waste in going about it.What to do with Professor Quirrell, or for that matter Bellatrix, after the portkey took them to where they were supposed to hand Bellatrix over to the psychiatric healer… well, Harry could work that out alongthe way. Harry would probably have to bamboozle the healer into doing something—which was going to take one hell of a bamboozling, andHarry wasn’t even sure what he wanted done—but he and Bellatrix had toget moving now.The main problem Harry saw, as he quickly ran the whole process forward in his imagination, would come when they reached the roof. Professor Quirrell had been supposed to sneak around invisibly and Confundthe monitors that would notice visitors in the aerial surroundings of Azkaban, causing them to see a repeating loop of scenery for a few minutes.Professor Quirrell had said that he couldn’t Disillusion Harry’s Patronus;and if they switched off the Patronus, the Dementors would notice Bellatrix was missing, and alert the Aurors…Harry’s train of thought stumbled.There were times when ‘Aw, crap’ just didn’t seem to cover it.Li’s hands were sure despite the adrenaline, as he unlocked the bars onthe Vanishing Cabinet that linked Azkaban to a well-guarded room inthe interior of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. (A one-wayVanishing Cabinet, of course. The wards permitted a few fast ways intoAzkaban, all of them highly restricted, and no fast ways out.)Li stepped well back, pointed his wand at the Cabinet, spoke the incantation “Harmonia Nectere Passus”, and not a second later—The door of the Cabinet burst open with a bang, and into the roomstrode a heavy-set, square-jawed witch with greyed hair cropped closearound her head. She wore no rank signs as she wore no jewelry or otherornamentation, it was only an ordinary Auror’s robes that she deemed fitto grace herself: Director Amelia Bones, head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and said to be the only witch in the DMLE whocould take Mad-Eye Moody in a fair fight (not that either of those twowere the sort to fight fairly). Li had heard rumors that Amelia could Apparate within the bounds of the DMLE, and this was the sort of thing thatgave rise to rumors like that, he’d called in the alarm not fifty seconds ago.“Get into the air, now!” Amelia barked over her shoulder at the femaleAuror trio following behind her with police broomsticks, they must haveall been crushed in there, waiting for Li to activate the Cabinet. “I wantmore aerial coverage on this place! And make sure you keep up your antiDisillusionment Charms!” Then her head turned toward him. “Report,Auror Li! Do we know how they got in yet?”852 *Another Auror trio holding broomsticks materialized in the Vanishing Cabinet and strode out after them even as Li began talking.They were followed by a trio of Hit Wizards in full battle gear.Then another trio of Hit Wizards.Then another broomstick team.The emaciated form that was Bellatrix Black was resting motionless onthe stairs when Harry got there, eyes closed, and when Harry asked in acold, high whisper whether she was awake, he got no response.A brief twitch of panic was countered by the thought that ProfessorQuirrell had knocked her out to prevent her from hearing the Dark Lord’scringing servant suddenly turn into a hardened criminal and then anexpert battlemage. Which was good, because she wouldn’t have heardHarry’s voice saying ‘Expecto Patronum’.Harry drew back the hood of the Cloak, pointed his wand at Bellatrix,and whispered as gently as he could, “Innervate.”From the way Bellatrix’s body jerked a little, Harry didn’t think he’dmanaged to get it quite gentle enough.The sunken dark eyes opened.“Bella dear,” Harry said in his cold, high voice, “I am afraid we’ve runinto a bit of a problem. Have you recovered enough to do small magics?”There was a pause, and then Bellatrix’s pale head nodded.“Very good,” Harry said dryly. “I won’t ask you to walk unaided,Bella dear, but I am afraid you must walk.” He pointed his wand at her.“Wingardium Leviosa.”Harry kept the flow of force down to something he could sustain fora while, and it was still probably lifting two-thirds of her current bodyweight. She was… thin.Slowly, as though for the first time in years, Bellatrix Black pushedherself to her feet.853 *Amelia strode into the duty room, Auror Li and his silver badger following behind her. She’d spun her Time-Turner the moment she’d heard thealarm, and then spent a tense hour preparing her forces for entry. Youcouldn’t loop time within Azkaban itself, Azkaban’s future couldn’t interact with its past, so she hadn’t been able to arrive before the DMLE hadgotten the message, but she should have arrived in time…Her eyes went straight to the corpse, uncloaked and looking very dead,floating beyond the viewing window.“Where is Bellatrix Black?” Amelia demanded, showing no fear beforethe creature of fear.Even her own blood froze for an instant, as the corpse parted its lips,and gurgled, “Do not know.”Harry watched, now fully invisible once more, as Bellatrix slowly leaneddown, took Professor Quirrell’s wand (which Harry dared not touch), andslowly straightened again.Then Bellatrix pointed the wand at the snake, and said, her voice precise though it was still a whisper, “Innervate.”The snake did not stir.“Shall I try again, my Lord?” she whispered.“No,” Harry said. He swallowed the sick feeling. Harry had decided tosay the hell with it and try to revive Professor Quirrell after he’d realizedthat the Dementors had probably alerted the Aurors by now. His high,cold voice went on, unperturbed, “Do you think you are able to perform aMemory Charm, dear Bella?”Bellatrix paused, and then said, hesitantly, “I think so, my Lord.”“Eliminate that Auror’s last half-hour of memory,” Harry commanded.He’d thought a bit about whether he wanted to provide any justificationfor that, what he would say if Bellatrix asked why they weren’t just killinghim, in which case Harry would explain that they were pretending to bea different power group and then tell her to shut up—But Bellatrix simply pointed her wand at the Auror, stood silently fora time, and finally whispered, “Obliviate.”854 *She swayed, then, but did not fall.“Very good, my dear Bella,” Harry said, and chuckled thinly. “And Iwill ask you to carry that snake.”Again, the woman said nothing, demanded no explanations, didn’task why Harry or the apparently-invisible Patronus caster couldn’t do it.She only staggered to where the long snake lay, slowly bent over, pickedit up, draped it over her shoulder.(A tiny little part of Harry observed that it was very relaxing to have aminion that would just follow orders so unquestioningly, and even got asfar as thinking that he could totally get used to having a minion like Bellatrix, before that mind-fraction was screamed into silence by his mortallyoffended remainder.)“Follow,” the boy commanded his minion, and began to walk.It was starting to get crowded in the duty room, almost too crowded tobreathe, though there was still space around Amelia herself; if needing tobreathe meant that you had to crowd Director Bones, it was better not tobreathe.Amelia looked at where Ora was fiddling with Auror McCusker’s mirror. “Specialist Weinbach,” she barked, causing the young witch to start.“Any response from One-Hand’s mirror?”“None,” Ora said nervously, “it’s… I mean it has to be jammed, notdead, carefully jammed because it didn’t set off the alarms, but the line isso blank the mirror might as well be broken…”Amelia didn’t let her expression change, though the part of her thatwas already mourning One-Hand got a little sadder and a lot more angry.Seven months, he’d had seven months left until his retirement after a fullcentury of service. She remembered him as an eager young Auror, so verylong ago, and his whole career he’d served the DMLE with perfect loyalty,at least when it came to anything really important…Someone would burn for this.855 *The Dementor still hovered outside the window, casting its uselessshadow of dread over their operations; all the creature could do was gurgle its lack of knowledge or fail to reply at all, when asked questions like‘Did Bellatrix Black escape?’ and ‘Why can’t you find her?’ and ‘How isshe being hidden?’ Amelia was starting to worry that the criminals werealready gone, when—“We found a hole in the roof over C spiral!” someone shouted fromthe doorway. “Still open, ward circumventions still active!”Amelia’s lips peeled back in a smile like a wolf opening its jaws to eat.Bellatrix Black was still in Azkaban.And in Azkaban, Bellatrix Black would remain forever.She took a stride toward the window, ignoring the Dementor now,and looked up at the sky above, to check with her own eyes the patrollingbroomsticks. She couldn’t see the whole sky from here, but she saw tenbrooms go past on a patrol pattern and that already ought to be enough tocatch anyone, though she fully meant to put every broom she could in theair. Her Aurors were equipped with the fastest racing broom currentlyon the market, the Nimbus 2000; no unsuccessful chases for her people.Amelia turned back from the window, and frowned. The room wasgetting ridiculously crowded, and two thirds of these people didn’t needto be here, they just wanted to be close to the center of the action. If therewas one thing Amelia couldn’t tolerate, it was people who did what theywanted instead of what was needed.“All right, you lot!” Amelia bellowed at them. “Stop hanging aroundhere and start securing the top level of each spiral! That’s right,” she saidto the looks of surprise, “all three! They could tunnel through a floor ora ceiling to go between them, in case you hadn’t worked that out! We’regoing down level by level until we catch them! I’ll take C spiral, Scrimgeour, you’re on B…” She paused, then, remembering that Mad-Eye hadretired last year, who could she… “Shacklebolt, you’re on the A spiral, takewith the strongest other fighters! Check every set of cells you pass, lookunder blankets, do the full set of detection Charms in every corridor! Nobody leaves Azkaban until the criminals are caught, nobody! And…” People looked at Amelia in surprise as her voice trailed off.856 *The criminals had invented some way to prevent the Dementors from findingBellatrix Black.That ought to have been impossible.It chilled her blood, contemplating that. It was like…Amelia took a deep breath, and spoke once more, in a voice of steelcommand. “And when you catch them, make bloody sure they’re the realcriminals and not our own people forced to take Polyjuice. Anyone behaves oddly, check them for the Imperius Curse. Keep each other in sightat all times. Don’t assume an Auror uniform is friendly if you don’t recognize the face.” She turned to the communications specialist. “Tell thebroomsticks. If one of the brooms peels off for no reason, half of them areto hunt it down while the rest keep patrolling. And change the harmonicson everything changeable, they may have stolen our keys.” Then back tothe rest of the room. “No Auror is above suspicion unless they have nofamily left to threaten.”She saw it, the cold looks that came over the older faces, saw some ofthe younger Aurors flinch, and knew that they understood.But she said it out loud, just to be sure.“We’re fighting the old Wizarding War today, everyone. Just becauseYou-Know-Who is dead doesn’t mean the Death Eaters have forgotten histricks. Now go!”Harry walked in silence through the gas-lit grey corridor, invisible besideBellatrix and the silver shape following them, trying to think of a betterplan.At first, when he’d realized that the Aurors probably knew already,and that moreover, Professor Quirrell wasn’t waking up…His thoughts had frozen up there, for a second.And then stayed frozen, even as he’d gotten himself and Bellatrixheading downward, to buy as much time as possible; the Aurors, Harryfigured, would start at the top and move down level by level. The Aurorscould afford to move slowly and securely; they knew their prey had noway out.857 *Harry hadn’t been able to think of any way out.Until Harry had said to himself, well, if it was just a war game, what wouldGeneral Chaos do?From which an answer had followed instantly.And then Harry had thought, but if it’s that easy, why hasn’t anyone broken out of Azkaban before?And after he’d realized the possible problem: Fine, what would GeneralChaos do about that?Whereupon General Chaos had come up with an amendment to hisfirst plan.It was…It was the most insanely Gryffindor thing Harry had ever…So now he was trying to think of a better plan, and not having muchluck.Picky picky picky, said Gryffindor. Who was complaining about not havingany plan one minute earlier? You should be glad we came up with anything at all,Mister Now-We’re-Doomed.“My Lord,” Bellatrix whispered haltingly, as she navigated the nextflight of stairs downward, “am I going back to my cell, my Lord?”Harry’s brain was distracted, so it took him that long to process thewords, and then another moment to process the horror, while Bellatrixcontinued speaking.“I would… please, my Lord, I would very much rather die,” her voicesaid. And then, in a smaller voice, a whisper that was barely there, “but Iwill go back if you ask it of me, my Lord…”“We are not going back to your cell,” hissed Harry’s voice, on automatic. Nothing of what he felt was allowed to reach his face.Um… said Hufflepuff. Did you seriously just think, ‘You ought to work forme, I would appreciate you?’A stone would respond to that kind of loyalty, Harry thought. Even if I’monly getting it by mistake, I can’t help but—She’s the Dark Lord’s loyal killer and torturer, and the supposed reason she’sloyal is because an innocent girl was broken into pieces and used as raw materialto make her, said Hufflepuff. Did you forget?858 *If someone shows me that much loyalty, even by mistake, there’s a part of methat can’t help but feel something. The Dark Lord must have been… evil doesn’tseem like a strong enough word, he must have been empty… to not appreciate herloyalty, artificial or not.The better parts of Harry didn’t have much to say to that.And that was when Harry heard it.It was faint, and it grew louder with every step they took forward.A woman’s voice, distant, indistinct.His ears, automatically, strained to make out the words.“…please don’t…”“…didn’t mean…”“…don’t die…”Then his brain knew who he was hearing, and in almost the same moment, figured out what he was hearing.Because Professor Quirrell wasn’t there to keep the silence any more,and Azkaban was not, in fact, silent.Faint the woman’s voice, repeating:“No, I didn’t mean it, please don’t die!”“No, I didn’t mean it, please don’t die!”It got louder with every step Harry took, he could hear the emotion inthe words now, the horror, the remorse, the desperation of…“No, I didn’t mean it, please don’t die!”…the woman’s worst memory, rehearsing over and over again…“No, I didn’t mean it, please don’t die!”…the murder that had sent her to Azkaban…“No, I didn’t mean it, please don’t die!”…where she was sentenced by the Dementors to watch whoever she’dkilled, die and die and die in an infinite repeating loop. Though she musthave been put in Azkaban recently, from the amount of life left in hervoice.The thought came to Harry, then, that Professor Quirrell had passedthose doors, heard those sounds, and given not the slightest sign ofdisturbance; and Harry would have called it a positive proof of evil, ifHarry’s own lips hadn’t remained silent in the presence of Bellatrix, his859 *breathing regular, while something inside him screamed and screamedand screamed.The Patronus brightened, not out of control, but it brightened, withevery step Harry took forward.It brightened further as Harry and Bellatrix descended the stairs,she stumbled and Harry offered her his left arm thrust outside theCloak, braving the sense of doom from being that close to the snakedraped around her neck. There was a surprised look on her face, but sheaccepted it, and said nothing.It helped Harry, being able to help Bellatrix, but it wasn’t enough.Not when he saw the huge metal door in the center of that level’s corridor.Not when they came closer, and the woman’s voice fell silent, becausethere was a Patronus near her now, and she wasn’t reliving her worstmemory any more.Good, said a voice inside him. That was step one.Harry’s steps carried him inevitably forward toward the metal door.And…Now unlock the door—…Harry kept walking…What do you think you’re doing? Go back and get her out of there!…kept walking…Save her! What are you doing? She’s hurting YOU HAVE TO SAVE HER!The portkey Harry was carrying could transport two humans, onlytwo, plus or minus a snake. If they’d had Professor Quirrell’s portkey too…but they didn’t, Professor Quirrell’s human form was carrying that, therewas no way to get it… Harry could only save one person today, and therewas only one person on the lowest level of Azkaban, in the most desperateneed…“DON’T GO!” The voice came in a scream from behind the metal door.“No, no, no, don’t go, don’t take it away, don’t don’t don’t—”There was a light in the corridor and it grew brighter.“Please,” sobbed the woman’s voice, “please, I can’t remember my children’s names any more—”“Sit down, Bella,” Harry’s voice said, somehow he kept his voice in acold whisper, “I must deal with this,” the Hover Charm diminishing andswitching off even as Bella obediently sat down, her skeletal form darkagainst the brightening air.I’ll die, thought Harry.The air went on brightening.After all, it wasn’t a certainty that Harry would die.It was just a probability of death, and weren’t some things worth aprobability of dying?The air went on brightening, the greater Patronus was beginning toform around him, the brilliant human shape was becoming indistinctwithin the burning air, as Harry’s life went to feed the fire.If I wipe out the Dementors, then even if I live, they’ll know it was me, that Iwas the one who did this… I’ll lose my support, lose the war…Yeah? said the inner voice that was urging him on. After you destroy allthe Dementors in Azkaban? I’d think that’d tend to prove your credentials as aLight Lord, actually, so SAVE HER SAVE HER YOU HAVE TO SAVE HER—The humanoid shape could no longer be seen as a separate entity.The corridor couldn’t be seen.Harry’s own body was invisible within the Cloak.There was only a bodiless viewpoint within an infinite expanse of silver light.Harry could feel the life leaving him, fueling the spell; far away, hecould feel the shadows of Death begin to fray.I meant to accomplish more with my life than this… I was going to fight theDark Lord, I was going to merge the wizarding and Muggle worlds…Lofty goals seemed very distant, very abstract, compared to onewoman begging him for help, it wasn’t certain that Harry would ever doanything more important than this one thing, this one thing that hecould do now and here.And with what might have been his last breath, Harry thought:There are other Dementors, probably other Azkabans… if I’m going to do this,I should do it when I’m closer to the central pit, it will take less of my life that way,which increases the probability that I’ll survive to destroy other Dementors… evenassuming this is the optimal thing to do, if there’s a right time and place to do this,it isn’t now and here, IT ISN’T NOW AND HERE!What? said the other part of him indignantly, as it searched for a counterargument that didn’t exist—Slowly the light died back down, as Harry concentrated on that oneindisputable fact, the one obvious truth that they weren’t in the optimalplace, the time couldn’t be now…Slowly the light died back down.Part of Harry’s life flowed back into him.Part had been lost as radiation.But Harry had enough left to stay on his feet, and keep the silver human shape bright; and when his wand arm raised and his voice whispered “Wingardium Leviosa”, the magic flowed obediently out of him andhelped Bellatrix to her feet. (For it wasn’t his magic he had expended, ithad never been his magic that fueled the Patronus Charm.)I swear, Harry thought, breathing as regularly as he could in Bellatrix’spresence, while tears streamed down his invisible cheeks, I swear upon mylife and my magic and my art as a rationalist, I swear by everything I hold sacredand all my happy memories, I give my oath that someday I will end this place,please, please may I be forgiven…And the two of them walked on, as a murderess’s voice screamed andbegged someone to come back and save her.There should have been more time, there should have been a ceremony, for Harry’s sacrifice of that piece of himself, but Bellatrix was beside him and so Harry just had to keep on walking without a pause, sayingnothing, breathing evenly.So Harry walked on, leaving a piece of himself behind. It would dwellin this place and time forever, he knew. Even after Harry came back someday with a company of other True Patronus casters and they destroyedall the Dementors here. Even if he melted the triangular building andburned the island low enough that the sea would wash over it, leavingno trace that such a place as this had ever once existed. Even then hewouldn’t get it back.862 *The flock of luminous creatures stopped staring downward, and beganpatrolling the metal corridor as if nothing had happened.“Just like last time?” Director Bones snapped in the direction of AurorLi, and the young Auror replied, “Yes, ma’am.”The Director fired off another query to see if the Dementors couldnow find their target, and looked unsurprised to hear a negative reply afew seconds later.Emmeline Vance was feeling torn between her loyalties.Emmeline wasn’t a member of the Order of the Phoenix any more,they had disbanded after the end of the last war. And during the war,she’d known, they’d all known, that Director Crouch had quietly approvedof their off-the-books battle.Director Bones wasn’t Crouch.But they were hunting Bellatrix Black now, who had been a DeathEater, and who was certainly being rescued by Death Eaters. Their Patronuses were behaving oddly—all the bright creatures stopping and staring off downward, before they’d gone back to following their masters.And the Dementors couldn’t find their target.It seemed to her that this would be an extremely good time to consultAlbus Dumbledore.Should she just suggest to Director Bones that they contact Dumbledore? But if Director Bones hadn’t contacted him already…Emmeline wavered for a while, probably too long, and then finally decided. The hell with it, she thought. We’re all on the same side, we need to sticktogether whether Director Bones likes it or not.At a thought, her silver sparrow fluttered onto her shoulder.“Drop behind us to guard our rear,” Emmeline murmured softly, almost without moving her lips, “wait until no one is looking directly atyou, then go to Albus Dumbledore. If he is not already by himself, waituntil he is. And tell him this: Bellatrix Black is breaking out of Azkaban,and the Dementors cannot find her.”863 *it was thankfully silent, the metal door on the next level down.Silent,Either there wasn’t someone behind there, or they were hurting qui-etly, maybe they were screaming but their voice had given out already, orthey were just muttering quietly to themselves in the dark…I’m not sure I can do this, Harry thought, and he couldn’t blame the despairing thought on the Dementors either. It would be better to be lower,safer to be lower, his plan would take time to implement and the Aurorswere probably already working their way down. But if Harry had to passany more of those metal doors while staying silent and keeping his breathing perfectly regular, he might go mad; if he had to leave a piece of himselfbehind at each one, soon there wouldn’t be anything left of him—A luminous moonlit cat leaped into existence and landed in front ofHarry’s Patronus. Harry almost screamed, which wouldn’t have helpedhis image with Bellatrix.“Harry!” said the voice of Professor McGonagall, sounding as alarmedas Harry had ever heard from her. “Where are you? Are you all right? Thisis my Patronus, answer me!”With a convulsive effort, Harry cleared his mind, repurposed histhroat, forced calm, swapped in a different personality like an Occlumency barrier. It took a few seconds and he hoped like hell that865 *Professor McGonagall didn’t notice a problem with that thanks to thecommunications delay, just as he hoped like hell that Patronuses didn’treport on their surroundings.A young boy’s innocent voice said, “I’m in Mary’s Place, Professor, inDiagon Alley. Going to the restroom actually. What’s wrong?”The cat leaped away, and Bellatrix began to chuckle softly, dusty appreciative laughter, but she cut herself off abruptly at a hiss from Harry.A moment later the cat returned, and said in Professor McGonagall’svoice, “I’m coming to pick you up right now. Don’t go anywhere, if you’renot around the Defense Professor don’t go back to him, don’t say anything to anyone, I’ll be there as quickly as I can!”And the bright cat blurred forward and vanished.Harry glanced down at his watch, noting down the time, so that afterhe got everyone out of here, and Professor Quirrell anchored the TimeTurner again, he could go back and be in the restroom of Mary’s Place atthe appropriate time…You know, said the problem-solving part of his brain, there’s a limit tohow many constraints you can add to a problem before it really is impossible, youknow that?It shouldn’t have mattered, and it didn’t really, it didn’t compare tothe suffering of a single prisoner in Azkaban, and yet Harry still foundhimself feeling very aware that if his plan didn’t end with him beingpicked up from Mary’s Place just like he’d never left, and the Defense Professor looking completely innocent of any and all wrongdoing, ProfessorMcGonagall was going to kill him.As their team prepared to eat another bite of territory out of C spiral,shielding and scanning before dispelling the previous shield to their rear,Amelia was tapping her fingers on her hip and wondering if she ought toconsult the obvious expert. If only he wasn’t so—Amelia heard the familiar crack of fire and knew what she would seeas she turned.866 *A third of her Aurors were spinning around and leveling their wandson the old wizard in half-moon glasses and a long silver beard who hadappeared directly within their midst, a bright red-golden phoenix on hisshoulder.“Hold your fire!” Polyjuice made it easy to forge the face, but fakingthe phoenix travel would have been rather more difficult—the wards permitted it as one of the fast ways into Azkaban, though there were no fastways out.The old witch and the old wizard stared at each other for a long moment.(Amelia wondered, in the back of her mind, which of her Aurors hadsent the word, there were several former members of the Order of thePhoenix with her; she tried to remember, in the back of her mind, if she’dseen Emmeline’s sparrow or Andy’s cat missing from the flock of brightcreatures; but she knew that it was futile. It might not even be any ofher people, for the old meddler often knew things he had no way at all ofknowing.)Albus Dumbledore inclined his head to Amelia in a courteous gesture.“I hope I am not unwelcome here,” the wizard said calmly. “We are all onthe same side, are we not?”“That depends,” Amelia said in a hard voice. “Are you here to helpus catch criminals, or to protect them from the consequences of theiractions?” Are you going to try to stop the killer of my brother from getting herwell-deserved Kiss, old meddler? From what Amelia heard, Dumbledore hadgotten smarter toward the end of the war, mostly due to Mad-Eye’s nonstop nagging; but had relapsed into his foolish mercies the instant Voldemort’s body was found.A dozen small points of white and silver, reflections of the shining animals, gleamed off the old wizard’s half-moon glasses as he spoke. “Evenless than you would I see Bellatrix Black freed,” the old wizard said. “Shemust not leave this prison alive, Amelia.”Before Amelia could speak again, even to express her surprised gratification, the old wizard gestured with his long black wand and a blazingsilver phoenix sprang into existence, brighter perhaps than all their otherPatronuses put together. It was the first time she’d seen that spell cast867 *wordlessly. “Order all your Aurors to cancel their Patronus Charms forten seconds,” said the old wizard. “What darkness cannot find, the lightmay.”Amelia snapped off the order to the communications officer, whowould notify all Aurors through their mirrors, commanding Dumbledore’s will to be done.That took a few moments, and it became a period of awful silence,none of the Aurors daring to speak, while Amelia tried to weigh her ownthoughts. She must not leave this prison alive… Albus Dumbledore wouldn’tturn into Bartemius Crouch without a strong reason. If he’d meant to tellher why, he already would have; but it certainly wasn’t a positive sign.Still, it was good to know they’d be able to work together on this one.“Now,” said a chorus of mirrors, and all the Patronus Charms winkedout except that blazing silver phoenix.“Is there another Patronus still present?” the old wizard said clearlyto the bright creature.The bright creature dipped its head in a nod.“Can you find it?”The silver head nodded again.“Will you remember it, should it depart and come again?”A final nod from the blazing phoenix.“It is done,” Dumbledore said.“Over,” said all the mirrors a moment later, and Amelia raised herwand and began recasting her own Patronus. (Though it took some extra concentration, with that wolfish smile already on her face, to thinkof the first time Susan had kissed her cheek, instead of dwelling on thelooming fate of Bellatrix Black. That other Kiss was a happy thought indeed, but not quite the right kind for the Patronus Charm.)They hadn’t even gotten to the end of that corridor before Harry’s Patronus raised its hand, politely, as though in a classroom.868 *Harry thought quickly. The question was how to—no, that was alsoobvious.“It seems,” Harry said in a coldly amused voice, “that someone hasinstructed this Patronus to speak its message only to me.” He chuckled.“Well then. Pardon me, dear Bella. Quietus.”At once the silver humanoid said in Harry’s own voice, “There is another Patronus which seeks this Patronus.”“What?” said Harry. And then, without pausing to think about whatwas happening, “Can you block it? Stop it from finding you?”The silver humanoid shook its head.No sooner did Amelia and the other Aurors finish recasting their Patronus Charms, when—The blazing silver phoenix flew off, and the true red-golden phoenixfollowed it, and the old wizard calmly strode after both of them with hislong wand gripped low.The shields around their territory parted around the old wizard likewater, and closed behind him with hardly a ripple.“Albus!” shouted Amelia. “What do you think you’re doing?”But she already knew.“Do not follow me,” the old wizard’s voice said sternly. “I can protectmyself, I cannot protect others.”The curse Amelia shouted after him made even her own Aurors flinch.This isn’t fair, isn’t fair, isn’t fair! There’s a limit to how many constraints you canadd to a problem before it really is impossible!Harry blocked off the useless thoughts, ignored the fatigue he wasfeeling, and forced his mind to confront the new requirements, he had tothink fast, use the adrenaline on following the chains of logic quickly andwithout hesitation, instead of wasting it on despair.869 *For the mission to succeed,(1) Harry would have to dispel his Patronus.(2) Bellatrix needed to be hidden from the Dementors after the Patronus was dispelled.(3) Harry needed to resist the Dementors’ drain after his Patronus wasdispelled.…If I solve this one, said Harry’s brain, I want a cookie afterward, and if youmake the problem any more difficult than this, I mean the slightest bit more difficult, I am climbing out of your skull and heading for Tahiti.Harry and his brain considered the problem.Azkaban had stood invincible for centuries, relying upon the impossibility of evading the Dementors’ gaze. So if Harry found another way tohide Bellatrix from the Dementors, it would rely on either his scientificknowledge or his realization that the Dementors were Death.Harry’s brain suggested that an obvious way to stop the Dementorsfrom seeing Bellatrix was to make her stop existing, i.e., kill her.Harry congratulated his brain on thinking outside the box and told itto continue searching.Kill her and then bring her back, came the next suggestion. Use Frigideiroto cool Bellatrix down to the point where her brain activity stops, then warm herup afterward using Thermos, just like people who fall into very cold water can besuccessfully revived half-an-hour later without noticeable brain damage.Harry considered this. Bellatrix might not survive in her debilitatedstate. And it might not stop Death from seeing her. And he’d have troublecarrying a cold unconscious Bellatrix very far. And Harry couldn’t remember the research on which exact body temperature was supposed to benonfatal but temporarily-brain-halting.It was another good outside-the-box idea, but Harry told his brain tokeep thinking of……ways to hide from Death…A frown moved over Harry’s face. He’d heard something about that,somewhere.One of the requisites for becoming a powerful wizard is an excellent memory,Professor Quirrell had said. The key to a puzzle is often something you read870 *twenty years ago in an old scroll, or a peculiar ring you saw on the finger of a manyou met only once…Harry focused as hard as he could, but he couldn’t remember, it wason the tip of his tongue but he couldn’t remember; so he told his subconscious to go on trying to recollect it, and refocused his attention on theother half of the problem.How can I protect myself from the Dementors without a Patronus Charm?The Headmaster had been repeatedly exposed to a Dementor from afew steps away, over and over throughout a whole day, and had come outof it looking merely tired. How had the Headmaster done that? CouldHarry do it too?It could just be some random genetic thing, in which case Harry wasscrewed. But assuming the problem was solvable…Then the obvious answer was that Dumbledore wasn’t afraid of death.Dumbledore really wasn’t afraid of death. Dumbledore honestly, trulybelieved that death was the next great adventure. Believed it in his core,not just as convenient words used to suppress cognitive dissonance, notjust pretending to be wise. Dumbledore had decided that death was thenatural and normative order, and whatever tiny lingering fear was still inhim, it had taken a long time and repeated exposures for the Dementorto drain him through that small flaw.That avenue was closed to Harry.And then Harry thought of the flip side, the obvious inverse question:Why am I so much more vulnerable than average? Other students didn’t fallover when they faced the Dementor.Harry meant to destroy Death, to end it if he could. He meant to liveforever, if he could; he had hope of it, the thought of Death brought himno sense of despair or inevitability. He was not blindly attached to hisown life; indeed it had taken an effort not to burn away all his life on theneed to protect others from Death. Why did the shadows of Death havesuch power over Harry? He would not have thought himself so afraid.Was it Harry, all along, who’d been rationalizing? Who was secretlyso afraid of death that it was twisting his own thoughts, as Harry hadaccused Dumbledore?Harry considered this, preventing himself from flinching away. It feltuncomfortable, but…But…But uncomfortable thoughts weren’t always true, and this one didn’tsound exactly right. Like there was a grain of truth, but it wasn’t hidingwhere the hypothesis said it was—And that was when Harry realized.Oh.Oh, I understand now.The one who is afraid, is…Harry asked his dark side what it thought of death.And Harry’s Patronus wavered, dimmed, almost went out upon the instant, for that desperate, sobbing, screaming terror, an unutterable fearthat would do anything not to die, throw everything aside not to die, thatcouldn’t think straight or feel straight in the presence of that absolutehorror, that couldn’t look into the abyss of nonexistence any more thanit could have stared straight into the Sun, a blind terrified thing that onlywanted to find a dark corner and hide and not have to think about it anymore—The silver figure had darkened to moonlight, was flickering like a failing candle—It’s all right, thought Harry, it’s all right.Visualizing himself cradling his dark side like a frightened child inhis arms.It’s right and proper to be horrified, because death is horrible. You don’t haveto hide your horror, you don’t have to feel ashamed of it, you can wear it as a badgeof honor, openly in the Sun.It was strange, to feel himself split in two like this, the track of histhoughts that gave the comfort, the track of his thoughts that followedhis dark side’s incomprehension at the alienness of the ordinary Harry’sthoughts; of all the things that his dark side associated with its own fearof death, the one thing it had never expected or imagined that it mightfind, was acceptance and praise and help…You don’t have to fight alone, Harry said silently to his dark side. The restof me will back you up on this. I won’t let myself die, and I won’t let my friends die872 *either. Not you/I, not Hermione, not Mum or Dad, not Neville or Draco or anyone,this is the will to protect… Visualizing wings of sunlight, like the wings of thePatronus he had spread, to give shelter to that frightened child.The Patronus brightened again, the world spun around Harry or itwas his own mind that was spinning?Take my hand, Harry thought and visualized, come with me, and we willdo this thing together…There was a lurch in Harry’s mind, like his brain had taken one stepto the left, or the universe had taken one step to the right.And in a brightly lit corridor in Azkaban, the dim gas lights far outshone by the steady and unwavering light of a human-shaped Patronus,an invisible boy stood with a strange small smile on his face, shaking onlyslightly.Harry knew, somehow, that he’d just done something significant,something that went beyond just strengthening his resistance to Dementors.And more than that, he’d remembered. Thinking of Death as an anthropomorphic figure had done the trick, ironically enough. Now Harry couldremember it, what was reputed to hide someone from the gaze of Deathhimself…In a corridor of Azkaban, a wizard’s striding legs came to an abrupt halt;for the bright silver thing that was his guide, had halted in midair, fluttering its wings in distress. The brilliant white phoenix craned its head,looking backward and forward as though confused; and then it turned toits master and shook its head in apology.Without another word, the old wizard turned and strode back the wayhe came.Harry stood straight and upright, feeling the fear wash over him andaround him. Some tiny part of him might have been eroded a little by873 *the waves of emptiness that broke continually upon his unmoving stone,but his limbs were not cold, and his magic was with him. In time thosewaves might corrode him and consume him, sneaking through whatevertiny part of him still cowered before Death instead of using its fear to energize itself for battle. But that doom would take time, with the shadowsof Death far away and uncaring of him. The flaw, the crack, the fault-linethat was in him had been repaired, and the stars blazed brightly in hismind, vast and unafraid, and brilliant in the midst of cold and darkness.To anyone else’s eyes, it would have seemed that the boy stood alonein the dimly lit metal corridor, wearing that strange smile.For Bellatrix Black and the snake draped around her shoulders wereconcealed by the Cloak of Invisibility, one of the three Deathly Hallowsand reputed to hide its wearer from the gaze of Death himself. The riddlewhose answer had been lost, and which Harry had found anew.And Harry knew, now, that the concealment of the Cloak was morethan the mere transparency of Disillusionment, that the Cloak kept youhidden and not just invisible, as unseeable as were Thestrals to the unknowing. And Harry also knew that it was Thestral blood which paintedthe symbol of the Deathly Hallows on the inside of the Cloak, binding intothe Cloak that portion of Death’s power, enabling the Cloak to confrontthe Dementors on their own level and block them. It had felt like guessing, and yet a certain guess, the knowledge coming to him in the instantof solving the riddle.Bellatrix was still transparent within the Cloak, but to Harry she wasno longer hidden, he knew that she was there, as obvious to him as a Thestral. For Harry had only loaned his Cloak, not given it; and he had comprehended and mastered the Deathly Hallow that had been passed downthrough the Potter line.Harry gazed directly at the invisible woman, and said, “Can the Dementors reach you, Bella?”“No,” said the woman in a soft, wondering voice. Then, “But my Lord…you…”“If you say anything foolish, it will annoy me,” Harry said coldly. “Orare you under the impression that I would sacrifice myself for you?”874 *“No, my Lord,” the Dark Lord’s servant replied, sounding puzzled,and perhaps awed.“Follow,” spoke Harry’s cold whisper.And they continued their journey downward, as the Dark Lordreached into his pouch, and took a cookie, and ate it. If Bellatrix hadasked, Harry would have claimed it was for the chocolate, but she didn’task.The old wizard strode back into the midst of the Aurors, the silver and thered-golden phoenixes now following behind.“You—” Amelia began to bellow.“They have dismissed their Patronus,” said Dumbledore. The old wizard didn’t seem to raise his voice but his calm words somehow overrodeher own. “I cannot find them now.”Amelia gritted her teeth, and put a number of scathing remarks onhold, and turned to the communications officer. “Tell the duty room toask the Dementors again if they can sense Bellatrix Black.”The communications specialist spoke to her mirror for a moment,and a few seconds later, looked up, surprised. “No—”Amelia was already cursing violently in her mind.“—but they can see someone else on the lower levels who isn’t a prisoner.”“Fine!” snapped Amelia. “Tell the Dementor that a dozen of its kindare authorized to enter Azkaban and seize whoever that is and anyone intheir company! And if they see Bellatrix Black, they’re to Kiss her immediately!”Amelia turned and glared toward Dumbledore, then, daring him toargue; but the old wizard only looked at her a bit sadly, and held his peace.Auror McCusker finished speaking to the corpse that drifted outside thewindow, conveying the Director’s orders.875 *The corpse gave him a deathly smile that almost unstrung his limbs,and then floated downward.Soon after, a dozen Dementors arose from where they had drifted inthe central pit of Azkaban, and headed outward, toward the walls of thevast metal structure that towered above them.Entering through holes set into the base of Azkaban, the darkest of allcreatures began their march of horror.876 *arry had hoped that he’d just achieved fusion with his mysteriousdark side and would be enabled to draw on all of its benefits withnone of its drawbacks, call up the crystal clarity and indomitable will ondemand, without needing to go cold or angry.Once again, he’d overestimated how much progress he’d made. Something had happened, but Harry still had a mysterious dark side, it was stillseparate from him, and his ordinary self was still domitable. And despitethe repair work he’d done on his dark side’s fear of death, he didn’t dare godark while unshielded in Azkaban, that was tempting fate way too much.Which was unfortunate, because a bit of nondomitability would havesure come in handy about now.What made it harder was that he couldn’t slump against a wall,couldn’t break into tears, couldn’t even heave a sigh. His dear Bella waswatching him and that wasn’t the sort of thing her Dark Lord would do.“My Lord—” Bellatrix said. Her low voice was strained. “TheDementors—they are coming—I can feel them, my Lord—”“Thank you, Bella,” said a dry voice, “I already know that.”Harry couldn’t sense the holes in the world the same way as whenhe’d been wearing the Deathly Hallow, but he could feel the empty pull877 *increasing in intensity. At first he’d mistaken it for the result of descending a stairwell, until he and Bellatrix had finished descending and the pullhad gone on increasing. Then decreased, as the Dementors moved awayalong the spiral, then increased as they went up another flight of stairs…There were Dementors within Azkaban itself now, and they were comingfor him. Of course they were. Harry might be resistant now, but he wasnot hidden.New requirement, Harry told his brain. Find a way of defeating Dementorsthat doesn’t invoke my Patronus Charm. Alternatively, find yet another way ofhiding someone from Dementors, besides the Cloak of Invisibility—I quit, said his brain. Find yourself another piece of computing substrate tosolve your ridiculously overconstrained problems.I mean it, thought Harry.So do I, said his brain. Put up your Patronus Charm and wait for the Aurorsto find you. Be sensible. It’s over.Give up…The sucking emptiness seemed to pull harder, as he thought it; andHarry realized what was happening, concentrated more intensely on thestars, turned his mind away from the despair—You know, observed the logical side of him, if you’re not allowed to thinkany negative thoughts because that will open your mind to the Dementors, that’sa cognitive bias too, how would you know if it actually was time to give up?A desperate sobbing scream rose up from below, words mixed in like“no” and “away”. The prisoners knew, the prisoners could feel it.The Dementors were coming.“My Lord, you—you should not risk yourself for me—take back yourCloak—”“Be silent, fool,” hissed an angry voice. “When I decide to sacrifice youI will tell you so.”She’s got a valid point, said Slytherin. You shouldn’t risk yourself for her,there’s no way her life is as valuable as yours.For an instant Harry considered sacrificing Bellatrix to save himself—And in that moment, some of the dim orange gas-light seemed to fleethe corridor, a touch of cold crept over Harry’s fingertips. And he knew,then, that to think of leaving Bellatrix to the shadows of Death, would878 *make him vulnerable once more. Even in the moment of making the decision, he might become unable to cast the Patronus Charm, for he wouldhave given up the thought that had saved him before.It occurred to Harry that he could still take the Cloak from Bellatrixafterward, even if he couldn’t cast the Patronus Charm; and then hehad to wrench his thoughts away from that option, focus firmly on hisdecision not to do it, or he might have just fallen over where he stood.For the whirlpool of emptiness swirling around him was now deadlystrong; there were screams coming from above, and the screams belowhad stopped.This is ridiculous, said his logical side. Rational agents shouldn’t haveto put up with this sort of censored reasoning process, all the theorems assumethat how you think doesn’t affect reality apart from your actual actions, which iswhy you’re free to choose an optimal algorithm without worrying about how yourthoughts interact with Dementors—…That is a really dumb idea, said Gryffindor. Even I think it’s a dumb ideaand I’m your Gryffindor side. You’re not seriously going to just stand there and—“We have a fix!” shouted Ora, holding up her magic mirror as though intriumph. “The Dementor outside the inner wall pointed to level seven, Cspiral, that’s where they are!”Her Aurors were looking at her expectantly.“No,” Amelia said in a level voice. “That’s where one of them is. TheDementors still can’t find Bellatrix Black. We are not running down thereand letting her through in the confusion, and we are not dividing ourforces to be ambushed. So long as we move with caution, we can’t lose.Tell Scrimgeour and Shacklebolt to keep going down level by level, sameas before—”The old wizard was already striding forward. Amelia didn’t evenbother cursing him, this time, as once again their carefully constructed879 *shields parted like water and rippled gently in his wake.Harry waited at the beginning of the corridor, just next to the stairs leading upward. Bellatrix and the snake were behind him, concealed by theDeathly Hallow that Harry had mastered; he knew, though he could notsee, that the emaciated sorceress was sitting upon the stairs, slumpedback, since Harry had withdrawn his Hover Charm to free up his mindand magic.Harry’s eyes were fixed on the far end of the corridor, next to the stairsthat led downward. Not in his mind now, but in true reality, the lightin the corridor had dimmed, the temperature had fallen. The fear thundered over him and around him like a sea whipped by hurricane winds,and the sucking emptiness had become a howling draw toward some approaching black hole.Up the stairs at the far end, floating smoothly through the dying air,came the voids, the absences, the wounds in the world.And Harry expected them to stop.With all the will and focus he could muster, Harry expected them to stop.Anticipated their stopping.Believed they would stop.…that was the idea, anyway…Harry shut down the dangerous stray thought, and expected the Dementors to halt. They had no intelligence of their own, they were just woundsin the world, their form and structure was borrowed from others’ expectations. People had been able to negotiate with them, offer them victimsin exchange for cooperation, only because they believed Dementors wouldbargain. So if Harry believed hard enough that the voids would turn andgo, they would turn and go.But the wounds in the world kept coming, the swirling fear seemedlike a solid thing now, the emptiness tearing at matter as well as mind,substance as well as spirit, you could see the metal beginning to tarnishas the holes in the world passed.A small sound came from behind him, from Bellatrix, but she said noword, for she had been instructed to remain silent.Don’t think of them as creatures, think of them as psychosensitive objects, theycan be controlled if I can control myself—The problem was that he couldn’t control himself so easily, couldn’tmake himself believe blue was green by an act of will. Couldn’t suppressall those thoughts about how irrational it was to make yourself believesomething. How impossible it was to trick yourself into believing something if you knew that was what you were doing. All the training Harryhad given himself against self-deception was refusing to switch off nomatter how harmful it was in this unique special case—The shadows of Death crossed the halfway point of the corridor, andHarry held up his hand, fingers spread, and said in a voice of firm andconfident command, “Stop.”The shadows of Death stopped.Behind Harry, Bellatrix gave a strangled gasp, like it was being tornout of her.Harry gestured to her, the signal he had set up in advance whichmeant, repeat what you heard the Dementors say.“They say,” Bellatrix said, her voice was shaking, “they said, ‘BellatrixBlack was promised us. Tell us where she hides, and you will be spared.’”“Bellatrix?” Harry said, making his voice sound amused. “She escapeda while ago.”A moment later, Harry realized that he should have said that Bellatrix was among the Aurors in the top level, that would have caused moreconfusion—No, it was wrong to think of the Dementors as trickable, they weremerely things, they were controlled only by expectations—“They say,” Bellatrix said in a cracked voice, “they say they know you’relying.”The voids began to move forward again.Her anticipations are more solidly believed than mine; she is controlling them,unwittingly—“Don’t resist,” Harry said, pointing his wand behind him.“I, I love you, farewell, my Lord—”881 *“Somnium.”It had helped, strangely enough, hearing those particular awfulwords, understanding Bellatrix’s mistake; it reminded Harry why he wasfighting.“Stop,” Harry said again. Bellatrix was asleep; now only his ownwill, his own expectations rather, should control those spheres ofannihilation—But they kept on gliding forward, and Harry couldn’t stop himselffrom worrying that the previous experience had damaged his confidence,which meant that he wouldn’t be able to stop them, and as he noticedhimself thinking that, he doubted even more—he needed more time toprepare, really ought to practice controlling just one Dementor in a cagefirst—There was only a quarter of corridor now between Harry and the shadows of death, the empty winds were so strong that Harry could feel theerosion beginning in the cracks of himself.And the thought came to Harry that maybe he was wrong, maybe Dementors did have their own desires and planning capability. Or maybethey were controlled by how everyone thought they worked, not just whoever was closest to them. And in either case—Harry drew up his wand into the starting position for the PatronusCharm, and spoke.“One of your number went to Hogwarts and did not return. It nolonger exists; that Death is dead.”The Dementors halted, a dozen wounds in the world stood motionless, while the emptiness screamed around them like a deadly wind tonowhere.“Turn and go and do not speak of this to anyone, little shadows, or Iwill destroy you as well.”Harry’s fingers slid into the starting position for the Patronus Charm,and readied himself to cast it; in his mind, the Earth shone among thestars, the day side bright and blue with reflected sunlight, the night sideglimmering with the light of human cities. Harry wasn’t bluffing, wasn’ttrying to do anything tricky with his thoughts. The shadows of Death882 *would move forward and be annihilated, or they would depart, he wasequally ready for either…And the voids retreated back as smoothly as they came, the winds ofnothingness lessening with each meter they traversed, as they slid backdown the stairs, and departed.Whether they truly had their own pseudo-intelligence, or whetherHarry had finally succeeded in expecting them to go… that, Harry didn’tknow.But they were gone.Harry took a moment to sit down beside the unconscious Bellatrix onthe stairs, and slumped down as she was slumped, closing his eyes for amoment, only a moment, he sure as hell wasn’t planning to sleep in Azkaban, but he needed to take that moment. The Aurors would still be goingdown the stairs slowly, Harry hoped, so it wouldn’t hurt to take just fiveminutes to rest. Harry was careful to keep his thoughts positive, cheerful,my, I’ll just have some nice regenerative rest here, and then I’ll feel better, ratherthan, say, my, I’ll just collapse in emotional and physical exhaustion, becausethe Dementors hadn’t yet retreated very far.And by the way, Harry said to his brain, you’re fired.“I found him!” cried the old wizard’s voice.Who? thought Amelia, as she turned to see Dumbledore’s return, carrying in his arms——the one sight, the one person, she would never have expected tobehold——a man in torn red robes, looking scorched like he’d fought a smallwar, blood dried on many cuts. His eyes were open, and he was chewingon a bar of chocolate, held in his one living hand.Bahry One-Hand was alive.A glad cry went up, her Aurors lowering their wands, some of themalready starting to rush forward.883 *“Stay on guard!” bellowed Amelia. “Check them both for Polyjuice—scan Bahry for small Animagi or traps—”“Innervate. Wingardium Leviosa.”There was a pause. Harry sensed, though he could not quite see, thatthe invisible woman was pushing herself to her feet, and turning her headto look around. “I’m… alive…?”Harry was sorely tempted to say no, just to see what she made of that.Instead he hissed, “Don’t ask stupid questions.”“What happened?” whispered Bellatrix.And the Dark Lord gave a wild, high-pitched laugh, and said, “I scaredthe Dementors away, my dear Bella.”There was a pause. Harry wished he could see Bellatrix’s face; had hesaid the wrong thing?After a time, in a quavering voice, “Could it be, my Lord, that in yournew form, you have begun to care for me—”“No,” Harry said coldly, and turned from her (though he kept his wandon her), and began walking. “And take care that you do not offend meagain, or I will abandon you here, use or no use. Now follow, or be leftbehind; I have work to do.”Harry strode forward, not listening to the gasping sounds that camefrom behind him; he knew Bellatrix was following.…because the last thing that woman needed, the very last thing sheneeded to start thinking before the psychiatric healer began trying to deprogram her, was to believe that her Dark Lord could ever love her back.The old wizard smoothed his silver beard contemplatively, looking atwhere Auror Bahry was being carried out of the room by two strongAurors.“Do you understand this, Amelia?”884 *“No,” she said simply. She suspected some trap they hadn’t yet beenable to fathom, which was why Auror Bahry was going to be kept outsidethe main party and guarded.“Perhaps,” the old wizard said at length, “whichever of their numbercan cast the Patronus Charm, is more than a simple hostage. Someonewho was tricked into this, mayhap? For whatever reason, they left yourAuror alive; let us not be the first to wield deadly curses, when we findthem—”“I see,” said the old witch in sudden realization, “that was their plan.It costs them nothing to Oblivate him and leave him alive, and makes ushesitate—” Amelia nodded decisively, and said to her people, “We carryon as before.”The old wizard sighed. “Any news from the Dementors?”“If I tell you,” Amelia snapped, “will you run off again?”“It costs you nothing, Amelia,” the old wizard said quietly, “and maysave one of your own people the fight.”Costs me nothing except my chance at vengeance—But that was nothing compared to the other, the annoying old wizardwas often right in the end, it was part of what made him so annoying.“The Dementors have ceased to answer questions about the other person they said they saw,” Amelia told him, “and they will not say why, norwhere.”Dumbledore turned to the blazing silver phoenix on his shoulder,whose light illuminated the whole corridor, and received a silent headshake in reply. “I cannot detect them either,” said Dumbledore. Then heshrugged. “I suppose I shall just walk the whole spiral from top to bottomand see if anything turns up, shall I?”Amelia would have ordered him not to do it, if she thought that wouldhave made the tiniest difference.“Albus,” said Amelia as the old wizard turned to depart, “even you canbe ambushed.”“Nonsense, my dear,” the old wizard said cheerfully as he strodeoff yet again, waving as though in admonition his fifteen-inch wand ofunidentifiable dark-grey wood, “I’m invincible.”There was a pause.885 *(“He didn’t just really say that—” whispered the newest Auror present,a still-prim young lady by the name of Noelle Curry, to the senior memberof her trio, Auror Brooks. “Did he?”)(“He can get away with it,” Isabel whispered back to her, “he’s Dumbledore, not even Fate takes him seriously anymore.”)“And that,” Amelia said heavily, for the benefit of the younger Aurors,“is why we never call him in on anything unless we absolutely must.”Harry lay very still on the hard bench that served as the bed of this cell,a blanket pulled over him, staying as absolutely motionless as he couldwhile he waited for the fear to return. There was a Patronus approaching,and a powerful one. Bellatrix was hidden by a Deathly Hallow, no easyCharm would penetrate that; but Harry did not know what other arts theAurors might employ to detect his own self, and dared not reveal his ignorance by asking her. So Harry lay on a hard bed, in a cell with a lockeddoor, and the mighty metal door locked behind him, in absolute darkness,with a thin blanket pulled over him, hoping that whoever it was wouldn’tlook in, or wouldn’t look too closely if they did—That wasn’t a point Harry could affect, really, that part of his fate layentirely in the hands of the Hidden Variables. Most of his mind was concentrating on the ongoing Transfiguration he was performing.Listening in the silence, Harry heard the quick footsteps approach;they paused outside his door, and then——continued onward.Soon the fear returned.Harry didn’t allow himself to notice his own relief, any more than heallowed himself to notice the fear. He was holding in his mind the formof a Muggle device rather larger than a car battery, and slowly applyingthat Form to the substance of an ice cube (which Harry had frozen usingFrigideiro on water from a bottle in his pouch). You weren’t supposed to886 *Transfigure things to be burned, but between the original substance being water, and the Bubble-Head Charm to protect their air supply, Harryhoped that this wouldn’t make him or anyone else sick.Now it was just a question of whether there would be enough timebefore the Aurors did a detailed check on this cell block, for Harry to finishthis Transfiguration, and the partial Transfiguration he would do afterthat—When the old wizard strode back empty-handed, even Amelia began tofeel a twinge of worry. She and the other two Auror teams had worked athird of the way down the three spirals, in synchrony so as not to allow anygap in their coverage that could be jumped by cutting through a ceiling,and they’d yet to find any sign.“Might I ask you to report?” Amelia said, keeping the edge out of hervoice.“First a simple walk from top to bottom,” said the old wizard. He wasfrowning, wrinkling his face even more than usual. “I examined Bellatrix’s cell, and found a death doll left in her place. This escape was meantto go unremarked, I think. There is something hidden in the corner beneath a scrap of cloth; I left that undisturbed for your Aurors to examine.On the return trip, I opened each door and looked within the cells. I sawnothing Disillusioned, only the prisoners—”They were interrupted by a scream from the red-golden phoenix, andall her Aurors flinched from it. Condemnation was in it, and an urgent demand that almost started Amelia running from the corridor on the spot.“—in rather distressing condition,” Dumbledore said quietly. Fora moment the blue eyes were very cold beneath the half-moon glasses.“Will any of you speak to me of the consequences of their actions?”“I did not—” Amelia began.“I know,” said the old wizard. “My apologies, Amelia.” He sighed.“Some of the more recent prisoners had scraps of their magic left, whenI looked upon them, but I sensed no uneaten power; the strongest hadonly as much magic left as a first-year child. I heard Fawkes scream in887 *distress many times, but never challenge. It seems you shall have to continue your search; they can hide well enough to escape my mere glance.”When Harry finished his first Transfiguration, he sat up, pulled back theblanket that had covered him, cast a quick Lumos, glanced at his watch,and was shocked to see that nearly an hour and thirty minutes had passed.How much of that time had gone by since someone had opened the doorand then closed it again—Harry hadn’t been looking in that direction, ofcourse—that, Harry couldn’t guess.“My Lord…?” whispered Bellatrix’s voice, soft and very tentative.“You may speak now,” Harry said. He’d told her to remain silent whilehe worked.“That was Dumbledore who looked upon us.”Pause.“Interesting,” Harry said neutrally. He was glad he had not noticedthis at the time. That sounded like a rather close shave.Harry said a word to his pouch, and began drawing forth the magicaldevice that he would mate to the product of his hour’s labor. Then, whenthat was drawn forth, another word brought forth a tube of industrialstrength glue; before using it, Harry cast the Bubble-Head Charm on himself and Bellatrix, and had Bellatrix cast the same Charm on the snake, sothat the glue fumes in the enclosed cell would not harm them.When the glue had begun to set, binding technology to magic, Harrylaid it down upon the bed, and sat down on the floor, resting his magicand will for a moment before essaying the next Transfiguration.“My Lord…” Bellatrix said hesitantly.“Yes?” said the dry voice.“What is that device you made?”Harry thought rapidly. It seemed like a good chance to check his planswith her, under the guise of leading questions.“Consider, my dear Bella,” said Harry smoothly. “How difficult is itfor a powerful wizard to cut the walls of Azkaban?”There was a pause, and then Bellatrix’s voice came, slow and puzzled,“Not difficult at all, my Lord…?”“Indeed,” said the dry, high voice of Bella’s master. “Suppose one wereto do this, and fly through the hole on a broomstick, and soar up and away.Rescuing a prisoner from Azkaban would seem easy then, would it not?”“But my Lord…” said Bella. “The Aurors would—they have their ownbroomsticks, my Lord, fast ones—”Harry listened, it was as he had thought. The Dark Lord replied, againin tones of smoothly Socratic inquiry, and Bellatrix asked a further question, which Harry had not expected, but Harry’s own counterquestionshowed that it should not matter in the end. And in response to Bellatrix’s last question, the Dark Lord only smiled, and said that it was timefor him to resume his work.And then Harry got up from the floor of the cell, went to the far end ofthe cells, and touched his wand to the hard surface of the wall—the wallof Azkaban, the solid metal that separated them from direct exposure tothe Dementors’ pit.And Harry began a partial Transfiguration.This spell would go faster, Harry hoped. He’d spent hours and hourspracticing the unique magic, which had made it routine, not much moredifficult for him than ordinary Transfiguration. The shape he was changing had not all that much total volume, the Transfigured shape might betall and wide and long, but it was very thin. Half a millimeter, Harry hadthought, would be enough, considering the perfect smoothness…On the long bench that served as a prison bed, where Harry had setdown the Transfigured technological device and the mated magic itemfor the glue to dry, tiny letters in golden script gleamed on the Muggleartifact. Harry hadn’t really planned for them to be there, but they’d keptrunning through the back of his mind, and so seemed to have becomepart of the Transfigured form.There were many different things Harry could have said before usingthis particular triumph of technological ingenuity. Any number of thingsthat would be, in one sense or another, appropriate. Or at least thingsthat Harry could have said, would have said, if Bellatrix had not been there.But there was only one thing to say, that Harry would only get thechance to say just this once, and probably never get a better chance to sayever again. (Or think, anyway, if he couldn’t say it.) He hadn’t seen theactual movie, but he’d seen a preview, and for some reason the phrasehad stuck in his mind.The tiny golden letters upon the Muggle device said,All right, you primitive screwheads! Listen up!n darkness absolute, a boy stood holding his wand to the solid metalwall of Azkaban, essaying a magic that only three other people in theworld would have believed possible, and that none save he alone couldwield.Of course a powerful wizard could’ve cut through the wall in seconds,with a gesture and a word.For an average adult it might have been a matter of a few minutes’work, and afterward they would have been winded.But to accomplish the same end as a first-year Hogwarts student, youhad to be efficient.Luckily—well, not luckily, luck had nothing to do with it—conscientiously,Harry had practiced Transfiguration for an extra hour every day, to thepoint where he was ahead of even Hermione in that one class; he’d practiced partial Transfiguration to the point where his thoughts had beguntaking the true universe for granted, so that it required only slightlymore effort to keep its timeless quantum nature in mind, even as he kepta firm mental separation between the concept of Form and the conceptof substance.And the problem with that art having become so routine…891 *it.…was that Harry could think about other things while he was doingSomehow his thoughts had managed to not go there, to not confrontthe obvious, until he was faced with the prospect of really actually doing itin just a few minutes.What Harry was about to do……was dangerous.Really dangerous.Someone-might-actually-genuinely-get-killed dangerous.Facing down twelve Dementors without a Patronus Charm had beenscary, but merely scary. Harry could have cast the Patronus Charm, wouldhave cast it as soon as he thought he was in danger of not being able todo so, as soon as he felt his resistance beginning to fail. And even if thathadn’t worked… even so, unless the Dementors had been instructed toKiss anyone they found, failure shouldn’t have been fatal.This was different.The Transfigured Muggle device could explode and kill them.The interface between the technology and the magic could fail in anynumber of ways and kill them.The Aurors could get in a lucky shot.It was just, well…Seriously dangerous.Harry had caught his mind trying to argue itself into believing that itwas safe.And sure, the whole thing could work, but…But even leaving out that rationalists weren’t ever allowed to arguethemselves into things, Harry knew he couldn’t possibly have argued himself into estimating less than a 20% probability of dying.Lose, said Hufflepuff.Lose, said the voice of Professor Quirrell in his mind.Lose, said his mental model of Hermione and Professor McGonagalland Professor Flitwick and Neville Longbottom and, well, basically everyone Harry knew except for Fred and George, who would have gone for itin a hot second.892 *He should just go find Dumbledore and turn himself in. He should,he really really should, it was the only sane thing to do at this point.And if it’d been only Harry on the mission, only his own life that’dbeen at stake, he would have; he surely would have.The part that was almost causing him to lose his concentration on thepartial Transfiguration he was performing, the part that was threateningto open him to the Dementors……was Professor Quirrell, still unconscious, still a snake.If Professor Quirrell went to Azkaban for his part in the escape, hewould die. He probably wouldn’t last even a week. He was that sensitive.It was that simple.If Harry lost here…He lost Professor Quirrell.Even though he’s probably evil, said the Hufflepuff part of him quietly.Even so?It wasn’t a decision that Harry had made in any conscious way. Hejust couldn’t do it. Losing was for House points, not people.If you think your own life is valuable enough that you’re not willing to takeon an eighty percent probability of dying in order to protect all the prisoners inAzkaban, his Slytherin side observed, there’s no way you can justify taking atwenty percent risk to your life to save Bellatrix and Professor Quirrell. The mathdoesn’t add up, you can’t be assigning consistent utilities over outcomes here.The logical side of him noted that Slytherin had just won the argument.Harry kept the Form in his mind, kept on casting the spell. He couldalways just abort the mission when he was done with the Transfiguration,he didn’t want to lose the effort he’d already invested.And then Harry thought of something else that suddenly made it veryhard to keep the magic going, very hard to keep up his resistance to theDementors.What if the portkey doesn’t take us where Professor Quirrell said it did?It was obvious in retrospect the moment he thought about it.Even if the planned escape went completely right, even if the Muggledevice worked and didn’t explode and didn’t interact badly with the mated893 *magic item, even if the Aurors didn’t get in a lucky shot, even if Harrymade it far enough away from Azkaban to use the portkey……there might not be a psychiatric healer at the end of it.That was something Harry had believed when he’d trusted ProfessorQuirrell, and he’d forgotten to re-evaluate it after Professor Quirrell wasno longer to be trusted.You can’t do this, said Hufflepuff. At this point we’re talking mere stupidity.Cold seemed to spread through the room, but Harry kept the Transfiguration going, even as his resistance against the Dementors faltered.I can’t lose Professor Quirrell.He tried to kill a police officer, said Hufflepuff. You already lost him, in thatmoment. Bellatrix is probably just what everyone thinks she is. Just take yourCloak back, go find Dumbledore and tell him you were tricked.No, thought Harry desperately, not without talking to Professor Quirrell,there might be an explanation, I don’t know, maybe he was standing far enoughaway from my Patronus that the Dementors got to him… I don’t understand, itdoesn’t make sense on any hypothesis, why he would do that… I can’t just…Harry turned his mind away from that chain of thought before it completely broke his resistance to the fear, because he couldn’t think of feeding Professor Quirrell to Dementors while staying resolved against Death,it was a cognitive impossibility.Your reasoning is artificially impaired, observed the logical part of himcalmly, find a way to unimpair it.All right, let’s just generate alternatives, Harry thought. Not choose, notweigh, certainly not commit… just think about what else I might be able to dobesides the original plan.And Harry went on cutting the hole in the wall. He was using partialTransfiguration on a thin cylindrical shell of metal, two meters in diameter and half a millimeter thick, running all the way through the wall. Hewas Transfiguring that half-millimeter thickness of metal into motor oil.Motor oil was a liquid and you weren’t to Transfigure liquids because theymight evaporate, but he and Bellatrix and the snake all had Bubble-HeadCharms. And Harry would cast Finite on the oil immediately after, dispelling his own Transfiguration…894 *…as soon as the separated and lubricated hunk of metal slid out of thewall and onto the floor of their cell, he’d slanted it so gravity would pull itin, once the Transfiguration was done.If Harry and Bellatrix didn’t exit on his broomstick through the resulting hole in the wall…Harry’s brain suggested that he could try to Transfigure a surfacecover over the hole in the wall, leaving a space for Bellatrix and ProfessorQuirrell to hide in, wearing the Cloak, while Harry turned himself in.And Professor Quirrell would eventually wake up, and he and Bellatrixcould try to figure out how to exit Azkaban on their own.It was, first of all, a dumb idea, and second, there would still be a hugehunk of metal on the floor of the cell, which would give it away.And then Harry’s brain saw the obvious.Let Bellatrix and Professor Quirrell use the escape route you invented. Youstay behind, and turn yourself in.Bellatrix and Professor Quirrell were the ones whose lives were atstake.They were gaining, not losing, from taking the risk.And there was no reason, no sane reason at all, for Harry to go withthem.A calm came over Harry as he thought it, the cold and darkness thathad been wavering around the fringes of his mind retreated. Yes, thatwas it, that was the creative outside-the-box route, that was the hiddenthird alternative. The falseness of the dilemma was obvious in retrospect.If Harry turned himself in, he didn’t have to turn in Bellatrix and Professor Quirrell. If Bellatrix and Professor Quirrell took a dangerous escaperoute, Harry didn’t need to go with them.Harry didn’t even need to face the embarrassment of admitting he’dbeen tricked, if he ordered Bellatrix to remove the memory. Everyonewould just assume he’d been kidnapped, including Harry himself. Admittedly, there was no plausible reason why the Dark Lord would everask Bellatrix to do that; but Harry could simply smile and tell Bellatrixshe wasn’t allowed to know, and that would be that…895 *Her Auror team had gotten around three-quarters of the way down Azkaban, as had the other two teams on the other two spirals. Amelia was feeling tenser already, though she was betting on the criminals hiding on thesecond-to-lowest floor, part of her wished Dumbledore had thought tocheck that specific floor more carefully and part of her was glad he hadn’t.And then there was a distant sound, like a tiny ‘tink’ noise comingfrom far away. Like a very loud sound coming from the second-to-lowestfloor, say.Amelia looked at Dumbledore before she realized, before she managed to stop herself.The old wizard shrugged, gave her a small smile, said, “Since youasked it, Amelia,” and went off yet again.“Finite Incantatem,” Harry said to the oil coating the giant chunk of metalon the floor. He hardly heard himself speak, his ears were still ringingfrom the gigantic thud of the solid metal sliding out of the wall and falling.(He should have put up a Quieting Charm, in retrospect, though thatwouldn’t have stopped the noise from spreading through the solid metalfloor.) And then Harry said it again, “Finite Incantatem” to the oil coating the two-meter hole in the wall, spreading the effect wide; it was hisown magic Harry was canceling, which made the spell almost effortless.Harry was feeling a bit tired now, but that was the last use of magic hewould need. He hadn’t even needed to do it, really, but Harry didn’t wantto leave Transfigured liquid lying around, and he didn’t want to betraythe secret of partial Transfiguration either.It seemed very… inviting, that two-meter hole leading to freedom.The light from outside coming in… wasn’t exactly the Sun shining onhis face, but it was brighter than anything of Azkaban’s interior.Harry was tempted to just go with, just hop on the broomstick withBellatrix and the snake. Chances were that they would get out safely. Andif they did get out safely, and Harry came with, then he and Professor896 *Quirrell could go back in time and look perfectly innocent, everythingcould go back to normal.If Harry stayed behind and turned himself in… then even if everyoneassumed Harry had been a hostage, assumed Harry had lied to Professor McGonagall’s Patronus at wandpoint… even if Harry himself got offlightly, well…It wasn’t likely that the Defense Professor would go on teaching atHogwarts.Professor Quirrell would have reached the predestined end of his career, in February of the school year.And yes, Professor McGonagall would kill Harry, and yes, it would beslow and painful.But staying behind was the sensible, safe, sane thing to do, and Harrywas feeling more relaxed than regretful.Harry turned to Bellatrix; he opened his mouth to instruct her a finaltime—And there was a hiss, a weak hiss, a hiss that sounded slow and confused, and the hiss said,“What wass… that noisse?”Through the corridor the old wizard strode. He came to a metal doorand opened it, already knowing from memory that the cells within wereempty.Seven mighty and discerning incantations the wizard spoke then, before he moved on; it would be little enough exertion in total, with so fewcells left to check.“Teacher,” Harry hissed. So many emotions bubbling up in him, all at once.He knew, though he could not see, that the green snake around Bellatrix’sshoulders, was slowly lifting its head to look around. “Are you… all right,teacher?”“Teacher?” came the weak, confused hiss. “Where iss thiss?”897 *“Prisson,” Harry hissed, “the prisson with life-eaterss, we were to resscue awoman, you and I. You tried to sslay the protector man, I blocked your killing cursse,there was a ressonance between uss… you fell unconssciouss, I had to defeat theprotector man mysself… my guardian Charm wass disspelled, the life-eaterss couldtell the protectorss that the woman had esscaped. There iss ssomeone here who canssensse my guardian Charm, probably the sschoolmasster… so had to disspell myguardian Charm, ﬁnd different way to hide you and the woman from life-eatersswithout guardian Charm, learn to protect mysself without guardian Charm, sscareoff life-eaterss without guardian Charm, then devisse new esscape plan for you andthe woman, and ﬁnally, cut hole in thick metal wall of prisson even though I am onlyﬁrsst-year sstudent. No time to explain, you musst go now. If we never meet again,teacher, then I was glad to know you for a time, even though you are probably evil. Itiss good to have the chance to ssay thiss much: Goodbye.”And Harry took the broomstick and presented it to Bellatrix, sayingsimply, “Get on.”He had decided to keep the memories. For one thing, they were important. For another, he and the Defense Professor had started planningthis a week ago, and Harry wasn’t about to obliterate the whole last week,or explain to Bellatrix exactly what needed to be Obliviated. Harry couldprobably fool Veritaserum, and if Dumbledore insisted that Harry drophis Occlumency shields for a deeper examination… well, Harry had actedheroically throughout.“Sstop!” said the snake. Its voice was stronger now. “Sstop, sstop, sstop!What do you mean, goodbye?”“Esscape plan iss rissky,” said Harry. “My life iss not at sstake, only yourss andherss. Sso I am sstaying, turning mysself in—”“No!” said the snake. The hiss was forceful. “Musst not! Not permitted!”Bellatrix mounted the broomstick; Harry could sense (but never see)her head turning to look at him, she said no word. Awaiting him, perhaps,or merely awaiting his orders.“No longer trusst you,” Harry said simply. “Not ssince you tried to sslay theprotector man.”And the snake hissed, “I did not sseek to sslay the protector man! Are you fool,boy? Sslaying him would not make ssensse, evil or no!”The Earth ceased to turn on its axis, paused in its orbit around theSun.The snake’s hiss was now more furious than anything Harry had everheard from the human Professor Quirrell. “Sslay him? Had I ssought to sslayhim he would have been dead within ssecondss, fool boy, he wass no match for me! Issought to ssubdue, to dominate, force him to drop sshieldss upon hiss mind, needed toread him, to know who awaited hiss reply, learn detailss for memory sspell—”“You casst killing cursse!”“Knew he would dodge!”“Wass hiss life worth sso little? What if he did not dodge?”“Would have pusshed him out of the way with own magic, fool boy!”Again the pause in the planet’s spin. Harry hadn’t thought of that.“Witlesss dunce of a plotter,” hissed the snake, so angrily that the hissesseemed to overlap and slither over each other’s tails, “clever imbecile, cunningidiot, fool of an untrained Sslytherin, your missplaced misstrust hass ruined—”“Thiss iss not a fair time to argue,” Harry observed mildly. The surge of relief trying to flood through him was canceled by the increased tension.“Ssince I cannot get angry at you properly, without opening mysself to life-eaterss.Musst russh, ssomeone may have heard noisse—”“Explain esscape plan,” the snake said imperiously. “Sswiftly!”Harry explained. Parseltongue didn’t have words for the Muggle technology, but Harry described the function and Professor Quirrell seemedto understand.There were a few short hisses, the snakish equivalent of a bark of surprised laughter, and then, snapped commands. “Tell woman to look away,casst sspell of ssilence, sset guardian Charm outside door. Will transsform mysself,make few sswift improvementss to your invention, give woman emergency potion ssosshe can sshield uss, transsform back before you disspell Charm. Plan will be ssafer,then.”“And am I to believe,” Harry hissed, “that healer for woman truly awaitss uss?”“Usse ssensse, boy! Ssupposse I am evil. To end usse of you here iss obvioussly notwhat I planned. Misssion iss target of opportunity, invented after ssaw your guardianCharm, whole affair meant to be unnoticed, hid when left eating-place. Obviousslyyou will ssee persson pretending to be healer on arrival! Go back to eating-place afterward, original plan carriess on undissturbed!”Harry stared at the invisible snake.On the one hand, saying it like that made Harry feel rather dumb.And on the other hand, it wasn’t exactly reassuring.“Sso,” Harry hissed, “what iss your plan for me, precissely?”“You ssaid no time,” came the snake’s hiss, “but plan iss for you to rule country,obvioussly, even your young noble friend hass undersstood that by now, assk him onreturn if you wissh. Will ssay no more now, iss time to fly, not sspeak.”The old wizard reached out toward another metal door, from behindwhich came a endless dead mutter, “I’m not serious, I’m not serious,I’m not serious…” The red-golden phoenix on his shoulder was alreadyscreaming urgently, and the old wizard was already wincing, when—Another cry pierced the corridor, phoenix-like but not the truephoenix’s call.The wizard’s head turned, looked at the blazing silver creature on hisother shoulder, even as ephemeral and substanceless talons launched thespell-entity into the air.The false phoenix flew down the corridor.The old wizard raced off after, legs churning like a spry young man ofsixty.The true phoenix screamed once, twice, and a third time, hovering before the metal door; and then, when it became clear that its master wouldnot return for all its calling, flew reluctantly after.Professor Quirrell had assumed his true form, this time—Polyjuice onlylasted for an hour without redosing—and though the Defense Professorwas pale, leaning against the metal bars of the nearest cell, his magicwas strong enough to seize his wand without a word, even as Bellatrixdoffed the Cloak and placed it obediently in Harry’s waiting hand. Thesense of doom was building once more, though not in full force, as theDefense Professor’s power returned, the fringes of its vast force clashingwith Harry’s slight childish aura.Harry said aloud the description of his Muggle device, naming it tothe observing wizard, and then a Finite from Harry turned all his hardwork back into an ice cube. Professor Quirrell could not cast spells onsomething Harry had Transfigured, for that would be an interaction,however slight, between their magics, but—Three seconds after, Professor Quirrell was holding his own Transfigured version of the Muggle device. A single barked word and a sweepof his wand, and the residue of glue was gone from the magical item;three more incantations later, the magical and technological were fusedtogether as though into a single thing, and Charms of Unbreakability andflawless function had been cast upon the Muggle device.(Harry felt a lot better about doing this under adult supervision.)A potion was thrown to Bellatrix, and Professor Quirrell and Harryboth commanded, “Drink,” as though speaking in the same voice. Theemaciated woman had already been lifting it to her lips, without waiting;for it was evident to anyone that this snake Animagus was a servant ofthe Dark Lord, and a powerful and trusted one.Harry finished pulling the hood of the Cloak of Invisibility over hishead.A brief and terrible magic lashed out from the Defense Professor’swand, scouring the hole in the wall, scarring the huge chunk of metal thatlay in the room’s midst; as Harry had requested, saying that the methodhe’d used might identify him.“Left-hand glove,” Harry said to his pouch, and drew it forth, and putit on.A gesture from the Defense Professor made a harness appear uponBellatrix’s shoulders, and another, smaller cloth device upon her hand,and something like handcuffs on her wrists, even as the woman finisheddrinking the potion.A strange, unhealthy color seemed to come over Bellatrix’s pale face,she straightened, her sunken eyes seemed brighter and far more dangerous……small wisps of steam were coming out of her ears…901 *(Harry decided not to think about that part.)…and Bellatrix Black laughed, then, sudden mad laughter that rangmuch too loudly amid the small prison cells of Azkaban.(Very soon, the Defense Professor had said, Bellatrix would fall unconscious and stay that way for quite awhile, the price of the potion she hadtaken; but for just a few moments she would regain perhaps a twentiethpart of the power she had once wielded.)The Defense Professor threw his wand toward Bellatrix, and an instant later blurred into a green snake.An instant after that the Dementors’ fear returned to the room.Bellatrix flinched only slightly, caught the wand, and gestured without a word; the snake flew up and was inserted into the harness on herback.Harry said “Up!” to the broomstick.Bellatrix attached the wand to the holster on her hand.Harry leaped onto the two-person broomstick in the lead position.Bellatrix followed behind him, she took the cufflike devices on herwrists and chained her hands to the grips of the broomstick, even asHarry’s right hand shoved his wand into his pouch.And the three shot forward through the hole in the wall——emerging into the open air, directly above the Dementors’ pit, inthe interior of the vast triangular prism that was Azkaban, the blue skynow clearly visible above them, shining down its daylight.Harry angled the broomstick and began accelerating, upward and toward the center of the triangular space. His left hand, gloved to preventdirect contact between his skin and something which Professor Quirrellhad Transfigured, held the switch of the control on the Muggle device.Far above them, distant shouts rang out.All right, you primitive screwheads!Aurors on fast racing broomsticks angled out of the sky, divingstraight down toward them, faint sparks of light already blazing downward as the first shots were fired.Listen up!“Protego Maximus!” shouted Bellatrix in a mighty, cracked voice, followed by a cackling laugh as a shimmering blue field surrounded them.902 *You see this?From the decaying pit in the center of Azkaban, over a hundred Dementors rose into the air, appearing to some as a great mass of corpses,a flying graveyard; appearing to another as a conglomerate of absencesthat seemed to form one vast rip in the world as they slid upward.This…The voice of an ancient and powerful wizard bellowed a terrible incantation, and a great blast of white-golden fire shot out of the hole in Azkaban’s wall, shapeless for only a moment before it began to form wings.Is…And the Aurors activated the Anti-Anti-Gravity Jinx that had beenbuilt into the wards of Azkaban, disabling all flying spells whose enchantment had not been cast with the recently changed passphrase.The lift on Harry’s broom switched off.Gravity, on the other hand, stayed on.Their broom’s upward rise slowed, started to decelerate, began theprocess of turning into a fall.My…But the enchantments that kept the broom pointed in a direction andallowed steering, the enchantments that kept the riders attached andsomewhat protected them from acceleration, those enchantments werestill functioning.Harry hit the ignition switch on the General Technics made, modelBerserker PFRC, N-class, ammonium perchlorate composite propellant,solid-fuel rocket that had been mated to his Nimbus x200 two-personbroomstick.And there was noise.had been invented during what a Muggle would haveBroomstickscalled the Dark Ages, supposedly by a legendary witch named Celes-tria Relevo, allegedly the great-great-granddaughter of Merlin.Celestria Relevo, or whichever person or group had really inventedthose enchantments, hadn’t known a darned thing about Newtonian mechanics.Broomsticks, therefore, worked by Aristotelian physics.They went where you pointed them.If you wanted to move straight forward, you pointed them straightforward; you didn’t worry about keeping some of the thrust going downward to cancel out the effect of gravity.If you turned a broomstick, all of its new velocity was in the new direction of pointing, it didn’t go sideways based on its old momentum.Broomsticks had maximum speeds, not maximum accelerations. Notbecause of anything to do with air resistance, but because a broomstickhad some maximum Aristotelian impetus its enchantments could exert.Harry had never explicitly noticed that before, despite being dextrousenough to get the best grades in flying class. Broomsticks worked somuch like the human mind instinctively expected them to work that his brainhad managed to entirely overlook their physical absurdity. Harry, on his firstThursday of broomstick lessons, had been distracted by more interestingseeming phenomena, words written on paper and a glowing red ball. So905 *his brain had simply suspended its disbelief, marked the reality of broomsticks as accepted, and proceeded to have its fun, without ever once thinking of the question whose answer would have been obvious. For it is a sadfact that we only ever think about a tiny fraction of all the phenomena weencounter…That is the story of how Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres was almostkilled by his own lack of curiosity.Because rockets did not work by Aristotelian physics.Rockets did not work like a human mind instinctively thought a flyingthing should work.A rocket-assisted broomstick, therefore, did not move like the magicalbroomsticks upon which Harry was such a very good flyer.None of this actually went through Harry’s mind at the time.For one thing, the loudest noise he’d ever heard in his life was preventing him from hearing himself think.For another thing, accelerating upward at four gravities meant thathe had around two and a half seconds, total, to go from the bottom to thetop of Azkaban.And even if they were two and a half of the longest seconds in the history of Time, that wasn’t enough room to do much thinking.There was time only to see the lights of the Aurors’ curses arrowingdown at him, slightly angle the broomstick to avoid them, realize that thebroomstick was simply continuing on with mostly the same momentuminstead of going in the direction he pointed it, and activate the wordlessconceptsandwhereupon Harry angled the broomstick much harder and then theystarted to very quickly approach the wall so he angled it back the otherway and there were more lights coming down and the Dementors weresliding smoothly up toward them along with some kind of giant wingedcreature of white-golden flame so Harry wrenched the broomstick backtoward the sky but now he was still sliding toward another wall so he tiltedthe broom slightly and he stopped approaching but he was too close so hetilted it again and then the distant Aurors on their broomsticks weren’tvery distant at all and he was going to crash into that woman so he spunhis broomstick straight away from her and then in another instant he realized his rocket was an extremely powerful flamethrower and in a fraction of a second it would be pointing directly at the Auror so he spun thebroomstick sideways as he kept going up and he couldn’t remember if itwas pointing at any Aurors now but at least it wasn’t pointing at herHarry missed another Auror by about a meter, zipping past him ona sideways-pointed flamethrower moving upward at, Harry would laterguess, around 300 kilometers per hour.If there were any screams of roasted Aurors he didn’t hear them, butthis was not evidence one way or another, because all that Harry was hearing at the moment was an extremely loud noise.A couple of calmer if not quieter seconds later, there didn’t seem to beany Aurors around, or any Dementors, or any giant winged flame creatures, and the vast and terrible edifice of Azkaban looked surprisinglytiny from this height.Harry got the broomstick pointed toward the Sun, faintly visiblethrough the clouds, it wasn’t high in the sky at this time of day andmonth of winter, and the broomstick accelerated for another two seconds in that direction and picked up an amazing amount of speed veryquickly before the solid-fuel rocket burned itself out.After that, once Harry could hear himself think again, when therewas only the howling wind from their ridiculous speed, and Harry’senchantment-assisted fingers gripping the broomstick were merely resisting the decelerating drag of moving way faster than terminal velocity,that was when Harry actually thought all that stuff about Newtonianmechanics and Aristotelian physics and broomsticks and rocketry andthe importance of curiosity and how he was never going to do anythingthis Gryffindor ever again or at least not until after he learned the DarkLord’s secret of immortality and why had he listened to Professor Quirinus “I asssure you, boy, I would not attempt thisss if I did not anticipate my ownssurvival” Quirrell instead of Professor Michael “Son, if you try anythingto do with rockets on your own, I mean anything whatsoever without atrained professonal watching, you will die and that will make Mum sad”907 *Verres-Evans.“WHAT?” shrieked Amelia at the mirror.The wind had died down to a bearable level as the air resistance slowedthem, giving Harry plenty of opportunity to listen to the buzzing, ringingsound that seemed to fill his whole brain.Professor Quirrell had been supposed to cast a Quieting Charmon the rocket exhaust… apparently there were limits to what QuietingCharms could do… in retrospect, Harry should have Transfigured a pairof earplugs, not just trusted to the Quieting Charm, though that probablywouldn’t have been enough either…Well, magical healing probably had something to treat permanenthearing damage.No, really, magical healing probably had something to treat that.He’d seen students go to Madam Pomfrey with injuries that sounded alot worse…Is there some way of transplanting an imaginary personality to someone else’shead? asked Hufflepuff. I don’t want to live in yours anymore.Harry shoved it all into the back of his mind, there really wasn’t anything he could do about it right now. Was there anything he should beworrying about—Then Harry glanced behind him, remembering for the first time tocheck whether Bellatrix or Professor Quirrell had been blown off thebroomstick.But the green snake was still in its harness, and the emaciated womanwas still clinging to the broomstick, her face still charged with unhealthycolor and her eyes still bright and dangerous. Her shoulders were shakinglike she was laughing hysterically, and her lips were moving as though toshout, but no sound was coming out—Oh, right.Harry took off the hood of his cloak, tapped his ears to let her knowhe couldn’t hear.Whereupon Bellatrix grasped her wand, pointed it at Harry, and suddenly the ringing in his ears diminished, he could hear her.A moment later he regretted it; the imprecations she was screamingat Azkaban, Dementors, Aurors, Dumbledore, Lucius, Bartemy Couch,something called the Order of the Phoenix, and all who stood in the wayof her Dark Lord, et cetera, were not suitable for younger and more sensitive listeners; and her laughter was hurting his newly healed ears.“Enough, Bella,” Harry finally said, and her voice stopped on the instant.There was a pause. Harry pulled the Cloak back over his head, juston general principles; and realized in the same instant that they mighthave telescopes down there or something, in retrospect pulling down hishood for even a moment had been an incredibly dumb move, he hopedthe whole mission didn’t end up failing because of that one error…We’re not really cut out for this, are we? observed Slytherin.Hey, Hufflepuff objected in sheer reflex, we can’t expect to do anythingperfectly the first time, we probably just need more practice FORGET I SAIDHarry looked back again, saw Bellatrix looking around with a puzzled,wondering look on her face. Her head kept turning, turning.And finally Bellatrix said, her voice now lower, “My Lord, where arewe?”What do you mean? was what Harry wanted to say, but the Dark Lordwould never admit to not understanding anything, so Harry replied,dryly, “We are on a broomstick.”Does she think she’s dead, that this is Heaven?Bellatrix’s hands were still chained to the broomstick, so it was only afinger that came up and pointed when she said, “What is that?”Harry followed the direction of her finger and saw… nothing in particular, actually…Then Harry realized. After they’d gone up high enough, there hadn’tbeen any clouds to obscure it any more.“That is the Sun, dear Bella.”It came out remarkably controlled, the Dark Lord sounding perfectlycalm and maybe a little impatient with her, even as the tears started downHarry’s cheeks.In the endless cold, in the pitch blackness, the Sun would surely havebeen…A happy memory…Bellatrix’s head kept turning.“And the fluffy things?” she said.“Clouds.”There was a pause, and then Bellatrix said, “But what are they?”Harry didn’t answer her, there was no way his voice could have beensteady, would have been steady, it was all he could do to keep his breathing perfectly regular while he cried.After a while, Bellatrix breathed, so softly Harry almost didn’t hear,“Pretty…”Her face slowly relaxed, the color leaving its paleness almost asquickly as it had arrived.Her skeletal body slumped down against the broomstick.The borrowed wand dangled lifelessly from the strap attached to herunmoving hand.Harry’s mind remembered then, the Pepper-Up potion came at a cost;Bellatrix would ssleep for a conssiderable time, Professor Quirrell had said.And in the same instant another part of Harry became utterly convinced, looking back at the chalk-white emaciated woman, seemingdeader in the bright sunlight than anything Harry had ever seen alive,that she was dead, that she had just uttered her last word, that ProfessorQuirrell had misjudged the dosage——or deliberately sacrificed Bellatrix to guard their own escape—Is she breathing?Harry couldn’t see if she was breathing.There was no way, on the broomstick, to reach back and take herpulse.Harry looked ahead to make sure they weren’t about to run into anyflying rocks, kept on steering the broomstick toward the Sun, the invisi*910 *ble boy and the possibly dead woman riding off into the afternoon, whilehis fingers gripped the wood so hard they turned white.He couldn’t reach back and perform artificial respiration.He couldn’t use anything from his healer’s kit.Trust Professor Quirrell to have not endangered her?Strange, it was strange, that even genuinely believing that ProfessorQuirrell hadn’t meant to kill the Auror (for it would have been stupid),thinking of the Defense Professor’s reassurances no longer felt reassuring.Then it occurred to Harry that he had yet to check—Harry looked back, and hissed, “Teacher?”The snake did not stir within its harness, and said no word.…maybe the snake, not being an actual rider, hadn’t been protectedfrom the acceleration. Or maybe coming that close to the Dementorswithout a shield, even for a moment in Animagus form, had knocked outthe Defense Professor.That wasn’t good.It was to have been Professor Quirrell who told Harry when it was safeto use the portkey.Harry steered the broomstick with whitened fingers, and thought, hethought very hard for a small unmeasured length of time, during whichBellatrix might or might not have been breathing, during which Professor Quirrell himself might have already been not-breathing for a while.And Harry decided that while it was possible to recover from the errorof wasting the portkey in his possession, it was not possible to recoverfrom the error of letting a brain go too long without oxygen.So Harry took the next portkey in the sequence from his pouch, as heslowed his broomstick to a halt in the bright blue air (Harry didn’t know,when he thought about it, whether a portkey’s ability to adjust for theEarth’s rotation also included the ability to match velocity in general withits new surroundings), touched the portkey to the broomstick, and…Harry paused, still holding the twig, the mate of the twig he hadsnapped what seemed like two weeks ago. He was feeling a suddenreluctance; his brain seemed to have learned the rule, by some purelyneural process of operant conditioning, that Snapping Twigs Is A BadIdea.But that wasn’t actually logical, so Harry snapped the twig anyway.There was a thunderous boom from behind the nearby metal door, causing Amelia to drop the mirror she was holding and spin around with herwand in hand, and then that door burst open to reveal Albus Dumbledore,standing there in front of a great smoking hole in the prison wall.“Amelia,” said the old wizard. There was no trace of any of his customary levity, his eyes were hard as sapphires beneath his half-moon glasses.“I must leave Azkaban and I must do so now. Is there any faster way thana broomstick to get beyond the wards?”“No—”“Then I require your fastest broomstick, at once!”The place where Amelia wanted to be was with the Auror who had beeninjured by that Fiendfyre or whatever it had been.What she needed to do was find out what Dumbledore knew.“You!” the old witch barked at the team around her. “Keep clearingthe corridors until you’re at bottom, they may not all have escaped yet!”And then, to the old wizard, “Two broomsticks. You can brief me oncewe’re in the air.”There was a match of stares, but not a long one.A sickeningly hard yank caught at Harry’s abdomen, considerably harderthan the yank that had transported him to Azkaban, and this time thedistance traversed was great enough that he could hear an instant of silence, watch the unseeable space between spaces, in the crack betweenone place and another.The Sun, which had shone on the two only briefly, was swiftly occluded bya raincloud as they shot away from Azkaban, in the direction of the windand faster than the wind.“Who’s behind it?” shouted Amelia to the broomstick flying a paceaway from her.“One of two people,” Dumbledore said back, “I know not, at this instant, who. If the first, then we are in trouble. If the second, we are all infar greater trouble.”Amelia didn’t spare any breath for sighs. “When will you know?”The old wizard’s voice was grim, quiet and yet somehow rising abovethe wind. “Three things they need for perfection, if it is that one: Theflesh of the Dark Lord’s most faithful servant, the blood of the DarkLord’s greatest foe, and access to a certain grave. I had thought HarryPotter safe, with their attempt on Azkaban all but failed—though I stillset guards upon him—but now I am fearful indeed. They have access toTime, someone with a Time-Turner is sending messages for them; and Isuspect the kidnap attempt on Harry Potter has already taken place somehours ago. Which is why we have not heard about it, being in Azkabanwhere Time cannot knot itself. That past came after our own future, yousee.”“And if it is the other?” shouted Amelia. What she had heard alreadywas worrying enough; that sounded like the darkest of Dark rituals, andcentering on the dead Dark Lord himself.The old wizard, his face now even grimmer, said nothing, only shookhis head.When the portkey’s yank had subsided, the Sun was only just peeking overthe horizon, looking more like dawn than sunset, as their broom hoveredlow above a brief expanse of dark-orange rock and sand, arranged intolumpy hills like someone had kneaded the land’s dough a few times andthen forgotten to roll it flat. In the near distance, waves rolled past inan endless vista of water, though the ground over which the broomstickhovered was above sea level by meters at the least.Harry blinked at the dawn colors, and then realized the portkey hadbeen international.“Oy!” came a brisk, female shout from behind him, and Harry spunthe broomstick to look. A middle-aged lady was holding up one handto her mouth in a deliberate calling gesture, and bustling forward. Herkindly features, narrow eyes, and umber skin marked a race unfamiliarto Harry; she was clad in brilliant purple robes of a style Harry had neverseen before; and when her lips opened again she spoke with an accentthat Harry couldn’t place, for he was not widely traveled. “Where wereyou? You’re two hours late! I almost gave up on the lot of you… hello?”There was a brief pause. Harry’s thoughts seemed to be moving oddly,too slow, everything felt distant, like there was a thick pane of glass between himself and the world, and another thick pane of glass betweenhimself and his feelings, so that he could see, but not touch. It had comeover him upon seeing the dawn’s light and the kindly witch, and thinkingthat it all seemed like a proper end to the adventure.Then the witch was rushing forward and drawing her wand; a muttered word severed the cuffs that bound the emaciated woman to thebroomstick, and Bellatrix was being floated down onto the sandy rockwith her skeletal arms and pale legs dangling like lifeless things. “Oh,Merlin,” whispered the witch, “Merlin, Merlin, Merlin…”She appears concerned, thought an abstract, distant thing between twopanes of glass. Is that what a real healer would say, or is it what someone toldto put on a performance would say?As though it wasn’t Harry who spoke, but some other part of himself behind yet another pane of glass, a whisper came from his lips. “Thegreen snake on her back is an Animagus.” Not high the whisper, not cold,only quiet. “He is unconscious.”The witch’s head twitched up, to look at where that voice had seemedto speak out of empty air, and then looked back down at Bellatrix. “You’renot Mister Jaffe.”“That would be the Animagus,” whispered Harry’s lips. Oh, thoughtthe Harry behind glass, listening to the sound of his own lips, that makessense; Professor Quirrell must have used a different name.“Since when is he a—bah, forget it.” The witch laid her wand on thesnake’s nose for a moment, then shook her head sharply. “Nothing wrongwith him that a day’s rest won’t cure. Her…”“Can you wake him up now?” whispered Harry’s lips. Is that a goodidea? thought Harry, but his lips definitely seemed to think so.Again the sharp headshake. “If an Innervate didn’t work on him—”began the witch.“I did not attempt one,” whispered Harry’s lips.“What? Why—oh, never mind. Innervate.”There was a pause, and then a snake slowly crawled out of its harness.Slowly the green head came up, looked around.A blur later, Professor Quirrell was standing, and a moment later hadsagged to his knees.“Lie down,” said the witch without looking up from Bellatrix. “Thatyou in there, Jeremy?”“Yes,” said the Defense Professor rather hoarsely, as he carefully laidhimself down on a relatively flat patch of sandy orange rock. He was notso pale as Bellatrix, but his face was bloodless in the dim dawn light. “Salutations, Miss Camblebunker.”“I told you,” said the witch, sharpness in her voice and a slight smileon her face, “call me Crystal, this isn’t Britain and we’ll have none of yourformality here. And it’s Doctor now, not Miss.”“My apologies, Doctor Camblebunker.” This was followed by a drychuckle.The witch’s smile grew a little wider, her voice that much sharper.“Who’s your friend?”“You don’t need to know.” The Defense Professor’s eyes were closed,where he lay on the ground.“How wrong did it go?”Very dryly indeed: “You can read about it tomorrow in any newspaperwith an international section.”The witch’s wand was tapping here, there, poking and prodding allover Bellatrix’s body. “I missed you, Jeremy.”“Truly?” said the Defense Professor, sounding slightly surprised.“Not even a tiny little bit. If I didn’t owe you—”The Defense Professor started to laugh, and then it turned into moreof a coughing fit.What do you think? said Slytherin to the Inner Critic, while Harry listened from behind the glass walls. Performance, or reality?Can’t tell, said Harry’s Inner Critic. I’m not in top critical form right now.Can anyone think of a good probe to gather more information? said Ravenclaw.Again that whisper from the empty air above the broomstick: “Whatis the chance of undoing all that was done to her?”“Oh, let’s see. Legilimency and unknown Dark rituals, ten years forthat to set in place, followed by ten years of Dementor exposure? Undothat? You’re out of your skull, Mister Whoever-You-Are. The questionis whether there’s anything left, and I’d call that maybe one chance inthree—” The witch suddenly cut herself off. Her voice, when it spokeagain, was quieter. “If you were her friend, before… then no, you’re nevergetting her back. Best understand that now.”I’m voting that this is a performance, said the Inner Critic. She wouldn’tjust blurt all that out in response to one question unless she was looking for anopportunity.Noted, but I’m putting a low weight of confidence on that, said Ravenclaw.It’s very hard not to let your suspicions control your perceptions when you’re tryingto weigh evidence that subtle.“What potion did you give her?” the witch said after opening Bellatrix’s mouth and peering inside, her wand flashing multiple colors of illumination.The man lying on the ground calmly said, “Pepper-Up—”“Were you out of your mind?”Again the coughing laugh.“She’ll sleep for a week if she’s lucky,” the witch said, and clucked hertongue. “I’ll owl you when she opens her eyes, I suppose, so you can comeback and talk her into that Unbreakable Vow. Have you got anything tostop her from killing me on the spot, if she manages to even move foranother month?”The Defense Professor, eyes still closed, took a sheet of paper from hisrobes; a moment later, words began to appear on it, accompanied by tinywisps of smoke. When the smoke had stopped rising, the paper floatedover toward the woman.The woman looked over the paper with raised eyebrows, gave a sardonic snort. “This had better work, Jeremy, or my last will and testamentsays that my whole estate goes into putting a bounty on your head. Speaking of which—”The Defense Professor reached again into his robes and tossed thewitch a bag that made a clinking sound. The witch caught it, weighed it,made a pleased sound.Then she stood up, and the pale skeletal woman floated off the groundbeside her. “I’m heading back,” said the witch. “I can’t start my workhere.”“Wait,” said the Defense Professor, and with a gesture retrieved hiswand from Bellatrix’s hand and harness. Then his hand pointed the wandat Bellatrix, and moved in a small circular gesture, accompanied by aquiet, “Obliviate.”“That’s it,” snapped the witch, “I’m taking her out of here before anyone does her any more damage—” One arm came around to hug the bonyform of Bellatrix Black to her side, and they both disappeared with theloud POP! of Apparition.And there was silence in that lumpy place, but for the gentle rush ofthe passing waves, and a little breath of wind.I think the performance is finished, said the Inner Critic. I give it two anda half out of five stars. She’s probably not a very experienced actor.I wonder if a real healer would seem more fake than an actor told to play one?mused Ravenclaw.Like watching a television show, that was how it felt, like watching atelevision show whose characters you didn’t particularly empathize with,that was all that could be seen and felt from behind the glass walls.Somehow, Harry managed to move his lips himself, send his ownvoice out into the still dawn air, and then was surprised to hear his ownquestion. “How many different people are you, anyway?”The pale man lying on the ground didn’t laugh, but from the broomstick Harry’s eyes saw the sides of Professor Quirrell’s lips curling up, theedge of that familiar sardonic smile. “I cannot say that I bothered keepingcount. How many are you?”It shouldn’t have shaken the inner Harry so much, hearing that response, and yet he felt—he felt—unstable, like his own center had beensubtracted—Oh.“Excuse me,” said Harry’s voice. It now sounded as distant and detached as the fading Harry felt. “I’m going to faint in a few seconds, Ithink.”“Use the fourth portkey I gave you, the one I said was our fallbackrefuge,” said the man lying on the ground, calmly but swiftly. “It will besafer there. And continue wearing your cloak.”Harry’s free hand retrieved another twig from his pouch and snappedit.There was another portkey yank, internationally long, and then hewas somewhere black.“Lumos,” said Harry’s lips, some part of him looking out for the safetyof the whole.He was inside what looked like a Muggle warehouse, a deserted one.Harry’s legs climbed off the broomstick, lay on the floor. His eyesclosed, and some tidy fraction of self willed his light to fail, before thedarkness took him.“Where will you go?” yelled Amelia. They were almost at the edge of thewards.“Backward in time to protect Harry Potter,” said the old wizard, andbefore Amelia could even open her lips to ask if he wanted help, she feltthe boundary of the wards as they crossed them.There was a pop of Apparition, and the wizard and the phoenix vanished, leaving behind the borrowed broomstick.918 *ake.”Harry’s eyes flew open as he came awake with a choking gasp,a jerking start of his prone body. He couldn’t remember any dreams,maybe his brain had been too exhausted to dream, it seemed like he’donly closed his eyes and then heard that word spoken a moment after.“You must awaken,” said the voice of Quirinus Quirrell. “I gave you asmuch time as I could, but it would be wise to reserve at least one use ofyour Time-Turner. Soon we must go backward four hours to Mary’s Place,appearing in every way as though we have done nothing interesting thisday. I wished to speak to you before then.”Harry slowly sat up in the midst of darkness. His body ached, and notonly in the places where it had laid on the hard concrete. Images tumbled over each other in his memory, everything his unconscious brain hadbeen too tired to discharge into a proper nightmare.Twelve terrible voids floating down a metal corridor, tarnishing themetal around them, light dimmed and temperature falling as the emptiness tried to suck all life out of the world—Chalk-white skin, stretched just above the bone that had remainedafter fat and muscle faded—A metal door—A woman’s voice—No, I didn’t mean it, please don’t die—I can’t remember my children’s names any more—919 *Don’t go, don’t take it away, don’t don’t don’t—“What was that place?” Harry said hoarsely, in a voice pushed out ofhis throat like water forced through a too-thin pipe, in the darkness itsounded almost as shattered as Bellatrix Black’s voice had been. “Whatwas that place? That wasn’t a prison, that was HELL!”“Hell?” said the calm voice of the Defense Professor. “You mean theChristian punishment fantasy? I suppose there is a similarity.”“How—” Harry’s voice was blocking, there was something hugelodged in his throat. “How—how could they—” People had built thatplace, someone had made Azkaban, they’d made it on purpose, they’d doneit deliberately, that woman, she’d had children, children she wouldn’tremember, some judge had decided for that to happen to her, someonehad needed to drag her into that cell and lock its door while she screamed,someone fed her every day and walked away without letting her out—“Why shouldn’t they?” said the Defense Professor. A pale blue light litthe warehouse, then, showing a high, cavernous concrete ceiling, and adusty concrete floor; and Professor Quirrell sitting some distance awayfrom Harry, leaning his back against a painted wall; the pale blue lightturned the walls to glacier surfaces, the dust on the floor to speckled snow,and the man himself had become an ice sculpture, shrouded in darknesswhere his black robes lay over him. “What use are the prisoners of Azkaban to them?”Harry’s mouth opened in a croak. No words exited.A faint smile twitched on the Defense Professor’s lips. “You know,Mr. Potter, if He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named had come to rule over magical Britain, and built such a place as Azkaban, he would have built it because he enjoyed seeing his enemies suffer. And if instead he began tofind their suffering distasteful, why, he would order Azkaban torn downthe next day. As for those who did make Azkaban, and those who do nottear it down, while preaching lofty sermons and imagining themselvesnot to be villains… well, Mr. Potter, I think if I had my choice of taking teawith them, or taking tea with You-Know-Who, I should find my sensibilities less offended by the Dark Lord.”920 *“I don’t understand,” Harry said, his voice was shaking, he’d readabout the classic experiment on the psychology of prisons, the ordinarycollege students who had turned sadistic as soon as they were assignedthe role of prison guards; only now he realized that the experimenthadn’t examined the right question, the one most important question,they hadn’t looked at the key people, not the prison guards but everyoneelse, “I really don’t understand, Professor Quirrell, how can people juststand by and let this happen, why is the country of magical Britain doingthis—” Harry’s voice stopped.The Defense Professor’s eyes appeared to be the same color as always,in the pale blue light, for that light was the same color as Quirinus Quirrell’s irises, those never-thawing chips of ice. “Welcome, Mr. Potter, toyour first encounter with the realities of politics. What do the wretchedcreatures in Azkaban have to offer any faction? Who would benefit fromaiding them? A politician who openly sided with them would associatethemselves with criminals, with weakness, with distasteful things thatpeople would rather not think about. Alternatively, the politician coulddemonstrate their might and cruelty by calling for longer sentences; tomake a display of strength requires a victim to crush beneath you, afterall. And the populace applauds, for it is their instinct to back the winner.”A coldly amused laugh. “You see, Mr. Potter, no one ever quite believesthat they will go to Azkaban, so they see no harm in it for themselves. Asfor what they inflict on others… I suppose you were once told that people care about that sort of thing? It is a lie, Mr. Potter, people don’t carein the slightest, and if you had not led a vastly sheltered childhood youwould have noticed that long ago. Console yourself with this: those nowprisoner in Azkaban voted for the same Ministers of Magic who pledgedto move their cells closer to the Dementors. I admit, Mr. Potter, that Isee little hope for democracy as an effective form of government, but Iadmire the poetry of how it makes its victims complicit in their own destruction.”Harry’s recently cohered self was threatening to shatter into fragments again, the words falling like hammerstrikes on his consciousness,driving him back, step by step, over the precipice where lurked some vastabyss; and he was trying to find something to save himself, some cleverretort that would refute the words, but it did not come.The Defense Professor watched Harry, the gaze reflecting more curiosity than command. “It is very simple, Mr. Potter, to understand howAzkaban was built, and how it continues to be. Men care for what they,themselves, expect to suffer or gain; and so long as they do not expect it toredound upon themselves, their cruelty and carelessness is without limit.All the other wizards of this country are no different within than he whosought to rule over them, You-Know-Who; they only lack his power andhis… frankness.”The boy’s hands were clenched into fists so tightly that the nails cutinto his palm, if his fingers were white or his face was pale you couldn’thave seen that, for the dim blue light cast all into ice or shadow. “You onceoffered to support me if my ambition were to be the next Dark Lord. Isthat why, Professor?”The Defense Professor inclined his head, a thin smile on his lips.“Learn all that I have to teach you, Mr. Potter, and you will rule thiscountry in time. Then you may tear down the prison that democracymade, if you find that Azkaban still offends your sensibilities. Like it ornot, Mr. Potter, you have seen this day that your own will conflicts withthe will of this country’s populace, and that you do not bow your headand submit to their decision when that occurs. So to them, whether ornot they know it, and whether or not you acknowledge it, you are theirnext Dark Lord.”In the monochromatic light, unwavering, the boy and the DefenseProfessor both seemed like motionless ice sculptures, the irises of theireyes reduced to similar colors, looking very much the same in that light.Harry stared directly into those pale eyes. All the long-suppressedquestions, the ones he’d told himself he was putting on hold until theIdes of May. That had been a lie, Harry now knew, a self-deception, hehad kept silent for fear of what he might hear. And now everything wascoming forth from his lips, all at once. “On our first day of class, you triedto convince my classmates I was a killer.”“You are.” Amusedly. “But if your question is why I told them that,Mr. Potter, the answer is that you will find ambiguity a great ally on yourroad to power. Give a sign of Slytherin on one day, and contradict it with922 *a sign of Gryffindor the next; and the Slytherins will be enabled to believewhat they wish, while the Gryffindors argue themselves into supportingyou as well. So long as there is uncertainty, people can believe whateverseems to be to their own advantage. And so long as you appear strong,so long as you appear to be winning, their instincts will tell them thattheir advantage lies with you. Walk always in the shadow, and light anddarkness both will follow.”“And,” said the boy, his voice level, “just what do you want out of allthis?”Professor Quirrell had leaned further back against the wall fromwhere he sat, casting his face into shadow, his eyes changing from paleice into dark pits like those of his snake form. “I wish for Britain to growstrong under a strong leader; that is my desire. As for my reasons why,”Professor Quirrell smiled without mirth, “I think they shall stay my own.”“The sense of doom that I feel around you.” The words were becoming harder and harder to say, as the subject danced closer and closer tosomething terrible and forbidden. “You always knew what it meant.”“I had several guesses,” said Professor Quirrell, his expression unreadable. “And I will not yet say all I guessed. But this much I will tell you: itis your doom which flares when we come near, not mine.”For once Harry’s brain managed to mark this as a questionable assertion and possible lie, instead of believing everything it heard. “Why doyou sometimes turn into a zombie?”“Personal reasons,” said Professor Quirrell with no humor at all in hisvoice.“What was your ulterior motive for rescuing Bellatrix?”There was a brief silence, during which Harry tried hard to control hisbreathing, keep it steady.Finally the Defense Professor shrugged, as though it were of no account. “I all but spelled it out for you, Mr. Potter. I told you everythingyou needed to deduce the answer, if you had been mature enough to consider that first obvious question. Bellatrix Black was the Dark Lord’s mostpowerful servant, her loyalty the most assured; she was the single personmost likely to be entrusted with some part of the lost lore of Slytherin thatshould have been yours.”923 *Slowly the anger crept over Harry, slowly the wrath, something terrible beginning to boil his blood, in just a few moments he would say something that he really shouldn’t say while the two of them were alone in adeserted warehouse—“But she was innocent,” said the Defense Professor. He was not smiling. “And the degree to which all her choices were taken away from her,so that she never had a chance to suffer for her own mistakes… it struckme as excessive, Mr. Potter. If she tells you nothing of use—” The DefenseProfessor gave another small shrug. “I shall not consider this day’s worka waste.”“How altruistic of you,” Harry said coldly. “So if all wizards are likeYou-Know-Who inside, are you an exception to that, then?”The Defense Professor’s eyes were still in shadow, dark pits that couldnot be met. “Call it a whim, Mr. Potter. It has sometimes amused me toplay the part of a hero. Who knows but that You-Know-Who would saythe same.”Harry opened his mouth a final time—And found that he couldn’t say it, he couldn’t ask the last question,the last and most important question, he couldn’t make the words comeout. Even though a refusal like that was forbidden to a rationalist, forall that he’d ever recited the Litany of Tarski or the Litany of Gendlin orsworn that whatever could be destroyed by the truth should be, in thatone moment, he could not bring himself to say his last question out loud.Even though he knew he was thinking wrongly, even though he knew hewas supposed to be better than this, he still couldn’t say it.“Now it is my turn to inquire of you.” Professor Quirrell’s backstraightened from where it had leaned back against the glacier wall ofpainted concrete. “I was wondering, Mr. Potter, if you had anythingto say about nearly killing me and ruining our mutual endeavor. I amgiven to understand that an apology, in such cases, is considered a signof respect. But you have not offered me one. Is it just that you have notyet gotten around to it, Mr. Potter?”The tone was calm, the quiet edge so fine and sharp that it would sliceall the way through you before you realized you were being murdered.924 *And Harry just looked at the Defense Professor with cool eyes thatwould never flinch from anything; not even death, now. He was no longerin Azkaban, no longer fearful of the part of himself that was fearless; andthe solid gemstone that was Harry had rotated to meet the stress, turningsmoothly from one facet to another, from light to darkness, warm to cold.A calculated ploy on his part, to make me feel guilty, put me in a position whereI must submit?Genuine emotion on his part?“I see,” said Professor Quirrell. “I suppose that answers—”“No,” said the boy in a cool, collected voice, “you do not get to framethe conversation that easily, Professor. I went to considerable lengthsto protect you and get you out of Azkaban safely, after I thought you hadtried to kill a police officer. That included facing down twelve Dementors without a Patronus Charm. I wonder, if I had apologized when youdemanded it, would you have said thank-you in turn? Or am I correct inthinking that it was my submission you demanded there, and not onlymy respect?”There was a pause, and then Professor Quirrell’s voice came in reply,openly icy with danger no longer veiled. “It seems you still cannot bringyourself to lose, Mr. Potter.”Darkness stared out of Harry’s eyes without flinching, the DefenseProfessor himself reduced to a mortal thing within them. “Oh, and areyou pondering now, whether you should pretend to lose to me, and pretend to humble yourself before my own anger, in order to preserve yourown plans? Did the thought of a calculated false apology even cross yourmind? Me neither, Professor Quirrell.”The Defense Professor laughed, low and humorless, emptier than thevoid between the stars, dangerous as any vacuum filled with hard radiation. “No, Mr. Potter, you have not learned your lesson, not at all.”“I thought of losing many times, in Azkaban,” said the boy, his voicelevel. “That I ought to simply give up, and turn myself over to the Aurors.Losing would have been the sensible thing to do. I heard your voice sayingit to me, in my mind; and I would have done it, if I had been there by myself.But I could not bring myself to lose you.”925 *There was silence, then, for a time; as though even the Defense Professor could not quite think of what to say to that.“I am curious,” said Professor Quirrell at last. “What do you think thatI should apologize for, precisely? I gave you explicit instructions in theevent of a fight. You were to stay down, stay out of the way, cast no magic.You violated those instructions and brought down the mission.”“I made no decision,” the boy said evenly, “there was no choice in it,only a wish that the Auror should not die, and my Patronus was there.For that wish to have never occurred, you should have warned me thatyou might bluff using a Killing Curse. By default, I assume that if youpoint your wand at someone and say Avada Kedavra, it is because youwant them dead. Shouldn’t that be the first rule of Unforgivable CurseSafety?”“Rules are for duels,” said the Defense Professor. Some of the coldness had returned to his voice. “And dueling is a sport, not a branch ofBattle Magic. In a real fight, a curse which cannot be blocked and must bedodged is an indispensable tactic. I would have thought this obvious toyou, but it seems I misjudged your intellect.”“It also seems to me imprudent,” said the boy, continuing as thoughthe other had not spoken, “to not tell me that my casting any spell on youmight kill us both. What if you had suffered some mishap, and I had triedan Innervate, or a Hover Charm? That ignorance, which you permittedfor purposes I cannot guess, played also some part in this catastrophe.”There was another silence. The Defense Professor’s eyes had narrowed, and there was a faintly puzzled look on his face, as though he hadencountered some completely unfamiliar situation; and still the manspoke no word.“Well,” said the boy. His eyes had not wavered from the Defense Professor’s. “I certainly regret hurting you, Professor. But I do not think thesituation calls for me to submit to you. I never really did understand theconcept of apology, still less as it applies to a situation like this; if you havemy regrets, but not my submission, does that count as saying sorry?”Again that cold, cold laugh, darker than the void between the stars.“I wouldn’t know,” said the Defense Professor, “I, too, never understood the concept of apology. That ploy would be futile between us, it926 *seems, with both of us knowing it for a lie. Let us speak no more of it,then. Debts will be settled between us in time.”There was silence for a time.“By the way,” said the boy. “Hermione Granger would never have builtAzkaban, no matter who was going to be put in it. And she’d die beforeshe hurt an innocent. Just mentioning that, since you said before that allwizards are like You-Know-Who inside, and that’s just false as a point ofsimple fact. Would’ve realized it earlier if I hadn’t been,” the boy gave abrief grim smile, “stressed out.”The Defense Professor’s eyes were half-lidded, his expression distant.“People’s insides are not always like their outsides, Mr. Potter. Perhapsshe simply wishes others to think of her as a good girl. She cannot usethe Patronus Charm—”“Hah,” said the boy; his smile seemed realer now, warmer. “She’s having trouble for exactly the same reason I did. There’s enough light in herto destroy Dementors, I’m sure. She wouldn’t be able to stop herself fromdestroying Dementors, even at the cost of her own life…” The boy trailedoff, and then his voice resumed. “I might not be such a good person,maybe; but they do exist, and she’s one of them.”Dryly. “She is young, and to make a show of kindness costs her little.”There was a pause at this. Then the boy said, “Professor, I have to ask,when you see something all dark and gloomy, doesn’t it ever occur to youto try and improve it somehow? Like, yes, something goes terribly wrongin people’s heads that makes them think it’s great to torture criminals,but that doesn’t mean they’re truly evil inside; and maybe if you taughtthem the right things, showed them what they were doing wrong, youcould change—”Professor Quirrell laughed, then, and not with the emptiness of before. “Ah, Mr. Potter, sometimes I do forget how very young you are.Sooner you could change the color of the sky.” Another chuckle, this onecolder. “And the reason it is easy for you to forgive such fools and thinkwell of them, Mr. Potter, is that you yourself have not been sorely hurt.You will think less fondly of commonplace idiots after the first time theirfolly costs you something dear. Such as a hundred Galleons from yourown pocket, perhaps, rather than the agonizing deaths of a hundred927 *strangers.” The Defense Professor was smiling thinly. He took a pocketwatch out of his robes, looked at it. “Let us depart now, if there is nothingmore to say between us.”“You don’t have any questions about the impossible things I did to getus out of Azkaban?”“No,” said the Defense Professor. “I believe I have solved most of themalready. As for the rest, it is too rare that I find a person whom I cannotsee through immediately, be they friend or foe. I shall unravel the puzzlesabout you for myself, in due time.”The Defense Professor shoved himself up, pushing back on the wallwith both hands and rising to his feet, smoothly if too slowly. The boy,less gracefully, did the same.And the boy blurted out the last most terrible question which he hadearlier been unable to ask; as though to say it aloud would make it real,and as though it were not, already, vastly obvious.“Why am I not like the other children my own age?”In a deserted side-road of Diagon Alley, where scraps of un-Vanishedtrash could be seen lodged into the edges of the brick street and the blankbrick building-sides that surrounded it, along with scattered dirt andother signs of neglect, an ancient wizard and his phoenix Apparated intoexistence.The wizard was already reaching within his robes for his hourglasswhen, in habit, his eyes jumped to a random spot between the road andthe wall, to memorize it—And the old wizard blinked in surprise; there was a scrap of parchment in that spot.A frown crossed Albus Dumbledore’s face as he took a step forwardand took the crumpled scrap, unfolding it.On it was the single word “NO”, and nothing more.Slowly the wizard let it flutter from his fingers. Absently he reacheddown to the pavement, and picked up the nearest scrap of parchment,928 *which looked remarkably similar to the one he had just taken; he touchedit with his wand, and a moment later it was inscribed with the same word“NO”, in the same handwriting, which was his own.The old wizard had planned to go back three hours to when Harry Potter first arrived in Diagon Alley. He had already watched, upon his instruments, the boy leaving Hogwarts, and that could not be undone (his oneattempt to fool his own instruments, and so control Time without altering its appearance to himself, had ended in sufficient disaster to convincehim to never again try such trickery). He had hoped to retrieve the boy atthe first possible moment after his arrival, and take him to another safelocation, if not Hogwarts (for his instruments had not shown the boy’sreturn). But now—“A paradox if I retrieve him immediately after he arrives in DiagonAlley?” murmured the old wizard to himself. “Perhaps they did not setin motion their plan to rob Azkaban, until after they had confirmed hisarrival here… or else… perhaps…”Painted concrete, hard floor and distant ceilings, two figures facing offacross from each other. One entity who wore the shape of a man in hislate thirties and already balding, and another mind that wore the formof an eleven-year-old boy with a scar upon his forehead. Ice and shadow,pale blue light.“I don’t know,” said the man.The boy just looked at him. And then said, “Oh, really?”“Truly,” said the man. “I know nothing, and of my guesses I will notspeak. Yet I will say this much—”929 *hrough green flame they whirled, through the Floo network theyspun, Minerva’s heart racing with a pounding horror that shehadn’t felt in ten years and three months, the corridors between spacecoughed and spit them out into the lobby of Gringotts (the safest Flooreceiver in Diagon Alley, the connection most difficult to intercept, thefastest way out of Hogwarts without a phoenix). A goblin attendantturned toward them, his eyes widened, he began a slightly respectfulbow—Determination, Destination, Deliberation!And the two of them were in the alley just in back of Mary’s Place,wands already out and raised, spinning around back-to-back and thewords of an Anti-Disillusionment Charm already rising to Severus’s lips.The alley was empty.When she turned back to look at Severus, his wand was already cracking down on his own head with a sound like smashing an egg, as his lipschanted words of invisibility; he took on the colors of his surroundings,became a blur of his surroundings, the blur moved and matched whatwas behind him and then there was nothing there.She lowered her wand and stepped forward to receive her ownDisillusionment—From behind her, the unmistakable sound of a burst of flame.She spun and saw Albus there, his long wand already drawn andraised in his right hand. His eyes were grim beneath the half-circles ofhis glasses, and Fawkes upon his shoulder had spread his fire-coloredwings in readiness for flight and fight.“Albus!” she said. “I thought—” She’d just seen him depart for Azkaban, and she’d thought not even phoenixes could return from there soeasily.Then she realized.“She escaped,” said Albus. “Did your Patronus reach him?”The pounding in her heart grew stronger, the horror in her veins solidified. “He said he was here, in the washroom—”“Let us hope he spoke true,” said Albus, the wand tapped her head witha sensation like water trickling over her, and a moment later the four ofthem (even Fawkes had been rendered invisible, though sometimes yousaw a flicker of something like fire in his air) were racing to the frontof the restaurant. They paused before the door while Albus whisperedsomething, and a moment later one of the customers visible through thewindows stood up with a vague look on his face and opened the door asthough taking a quick look outside for some friend; and the three of themwere through, racing past the unwitting customers (Severus was marking their faces, Minerva knew, and Albus would see any Disillusioned)toward the sign that pointed to the washroom—An old wooden door marked with the sign of a toilet burst open witha slam, and four invisible rescuers stormed through it.The small but clean wooden room was empty, fresh droplets of watershowed in the sink but there was no sign of Harry, only a sheet of paperleft on the closed lid of the toilet.She couldn’t breathe.The sheet of paper rose up into the air as Albus took it, and a momentlater was thrust in her own direction.M: What did the hat tell me to tell you?“Ah,” Minerva said aloud in surprise, her mind taking a moment toplace the question, it wasn’t the sort of thing you’d forget but she hadn’t932 *been thinking in that mode, really—“I’m an impudent youngster and Ishould get off its lawn.”“Eh?” said the air in Albus’s voice, as if even he could be shocked.And then Harry Potter’s head appeared, suspended next to the air beside the toilet, his face was cold and alert, the too-adult Harry she’d seensometimes, eyes darting back and forth and around.“What’s going on—” the boy began.Albus, now visible once more along with her and Fawkes, was movingforward in an instant, his left hand reached forward and plucked a hairfrom Harry’s head (producing a startled yelp from the boy), Minerva accepted the hair in her own hand, and a moment later Albus swept up themostly-invisible boy in his arms and there was a flash of red-golden fire.And Harry Potter was safe.Minerva took a few steps forward, leaned against the wall where Albusand Harry had been, trying to recover her poise.She’d… lost some habits, in the ten years since the Order of thePhoenix had disbanded.Beside her, Severus shimmered into visibility. His right hand wasalready drawing forth the flask from his robes, his left hand alreadystretching forth in demand. She gave him Harry’s hair, and a momentlater, it dropped into the flask of unfinished Polyjuice, which at oncebegan fizzing and bubbling as it settled into the potency that wouldenable Severus to act his part as bait.“That was unexpected,” the Potions Master said slowly. “Why did ourHeadmaster not retrieve Mr. Potter earlier, I wonder, if he was going sofar as to twist Time? There should have been nothing preventing himfrom doing so… indeed, your Patronus should have found Mr. Potter already safe…”She hadn’t thought of that, a different realization having jumped tothe forefront of her mind. It wasn’t nearly as horrifying as Bellatrix Blackhaving escaped from Azkaban, but still—“Harry has an invisibility cloak?” she said.The Potions Master did not answer; he was shrinking.933 *Tick-snick, drip-blip, ding-ring-tingIt still annoyed her, though it faded past attention after a while; andwhen and if she became Headmistress, she intended to Silence the wholelot. Which Head of Hogwarts, she wondered, had first been so inconsiderate as to create a device that made noise, to pass on to their successors?She was sitting in the Headmaster’s office with a quickly Transfigured desk of her own, doing some of the hundred little pieces of necessary paperwork that kept Hogwarts from grinding to a halt; she couldlose herself in it easily, and it prevented her from thinking about otherthings. Albus had once remarked, sounding rather wry, that Hogwartsseemed to run even more smoothly when there was an outside crisis forher to avoid thinking about……ten years ago, that was the last time Albus had said that.There was the chime that indicated an approaching visitor.Minerva kept reading her current parchment.The door slammed open, revealing Severus Snape, who took threesteps inward and demanded without the slightest pause, “Any word fromMad-Eye?”Albus was already rising from his chair, even as she tucked away herparchments and dispelled the desk. “Moody’s Patronus is reporting tothe me in Azkaban,” Albus said. “His Eye saw nothing; and if the Eye ofVance does not see a thing, then that thing does not exist. Yourself?”“No one has tried to forcibly take my blood,” Severus said. He gave aquick grimace of a smile. “Except the Defense Professor.”“What?” said Minerva.“He saw me for an impostor before I could even open my lips, andquite reasonably attacked me on the spot, demanding to know the whereabouts of Mr. Potter.” Another grimace of a smile. “Shouting that I wasSeverus Snape did not seem to reassure him, for some reason. I do believe that man would kill me for a Sickle and give back five Knuts change.I had to stun our good Professor Quirrell, which was not easy, and then hereacted poorly to the hex. ‘Harry Potter’, naturally alarmed, ran out andtold the owner, and the Defense Professor was taken to St. Mungos—”934 *“St. Mungos?”“—which said he had probably been overworking himself for weeksbefore he collapsed, such was his state of exhaustion. Your precious Defense Professor is fine, Minerva, the stunner may have helped him by forcing him to take a few days off. Afterward I declined the offer of a Flooto Hogwarts, and went back to Diagon Alley and wandered; but no oneseems to have wanted Mr. Potter’s blood today.”“Our Defense Professor is in the best of hands, I am sure,” said Albus.“Greater matters command our attention, Minerva.”It took considerable effort for her to wrench her attention back, butshe sat back down, and Severus gestured up a chair for himself as well,and the three of them drew together to begin their council.She felt like a Polyjuiced impostor, sitting with those two. War wasnot her art, nor plotting. She had to strain to keep one step ahead of theWeasley twins, and sometimes she failed at that. She was sitting here,ultimately, only because she had heard the prophecy…“We are faced,” the Headmaster spoke first, “with a rather alarmingmystery. I can think of only two wizards who might have engineered thisescape.”Minerva drew in her breath sharply. “There is a chance it is not YouKnow-Who?”“I’m afraid so,” said the Headmaster.She glanced to her side and saw that Severus looked as puzzled asherself. Afraid the Dark Lord was not rising again? She would have givenalmost anything for that to be true.“So,” Albus said heavily. “Our first suspect is Voldemort, risen againand seeking to resurrect himself. I have studied many books I wish I hadnot read, seeking his every possible avenue of return, and I have foundonly three. His strongest road to life is the Philosopher’s Stone, whichFlamel assures me that not even Voldemort could create on his own; bythat road he would rise greater and more terrible than ever before. Iwould not have thought Voldemort able to resist the temptation of theStone, still less because such an obvious trap is a challenge to his wit. Buthis second avenue is nearly as strong: The flesh of his servant, willinglygiven; the blood of his foe, forcibly taken; and the bone of his ancestor,935 *unknowingly bequeathed. Voldemort is a perfectionist—” Albus glancedat Severus, who nodded agreement, “—and he would certainly seek themost powerful combination: the flesh of Bellatrix Black, the blood ofHarry Potter, and the bone of his father. Voldemort’s final avenue isto seduce a victim and drain the life from them over a long period; inwhich case Voldemort would be weak compared to his former power. Hismotive to spirit away Bellatrix is clear. And if he is keeping her in reserve,to use only in case he cannot attain the Stone, that would explain why nokidnap attempt was made on Harry this day.”Minerva glanced again at Severus, saw him listening attentively butwithout surprise.“What is not clear,” the Headmaster continued, “is how Voldemortcould have engineered this escape. A death doll was left in Bellatrix’splace, her escape was meant to be undetected; and even though thatwent wrong, the Dementors could not find her after their first warning.Azkaban has stood impenetrable for centuries, and I cannot imagine anymeans by which Voldemort could have accomplished this.”“That may mean little,” Severus said, expressionless. “For the DarkLord to do what we cannot imagine requires only that he has a betterimagination.”Albus nodded grimly. “Unfortunately there is now another wizardwho laughs at impossibilities. A wizard who, not long ago, developed anew and powerful Charm which could have blinded the Dementors to Bellatrix Black’s escape. And he is implicated for other reasons, as well.”Minerva’s heart was skipping beats, she didn’t know how, or why, buta terrible apprehension was dawning on her as to who—“Who would that be?” said Severus, sounding puzzled.Albus leaned back and said the fatal words, even as she had fearedthem: “Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres.”“Potter?” demanded the Potions Master, as much shock in that usuallysilken voice as she had ever heard from him. “Headmaster, is this one ofyour jokes? He is in his first year at Hogwarts! A temper tantrum and afew childish pranks with an invisibility cloak does not make him—”“It is no joke,” said Minerva, her voice barely above a whisper. “Harryis already making original discoveries in Transfiguration, Severus.936 *Though I did not know he was researching Charms as well.”“Harry is no ordinary first-year,” the Headmaster said solemnly. “Heis marked as the Dark Lord’s equal, and he has power the Dark Lordknows not.”Severus was looking at her, and you would have needed to know himwell to recognize that his glance was pleading. “Am I to take this seriously?”Minerva simply nodded.“Does anyone else know of this… new and powerful Charm?” Severusdemanded.The Headmaster glanced at her apologetically—Somehow she knew, she knew before he even said it, and she wantedto scream at the top of her lungs.—and said, “Quirinus Quirrell.”“Why,” she said, in a voice that should have melted half the devices inthe office, “did Mr. Potter even TELL our Defense Professor about his brilliantnew Charm for breaking out of prisons—”The Headmaster passed a weary wrinkled hand across his equallywrinkled forehead. “Quirinus just happened to be there, Minerva. EvenI saw no harm in it at the time.” The Headmaster hesitated. “And Harrysaid his Charm was too dangerous to be explained to either of us; andwhen I asked him again, this day, he insisted he had still not explainedit to Quirinus, nor had he ever dropped his Occlumency barriers in theDefense Professor’s presence—”“Mr. Potter is an Occlumens? You gave him an invisibility cloak and heis immune to Veritaserum and he is friends with the Weasley twins? Albus, doyou have any idea what you have unleashed upon this school?” Her voicewas nearly shrieking, now. “By his seventh year there won’t be anythingleft of Hogwarts but a smoking hole in the ground!”Albus leaned back in his great cushioned chair, and said, smiling,“Don’t forget the Time-Turner.”She did scream then, but quietly.Severus drawled, “Should I teach him to brew Polyjuice, Headmaster?I ask only for the sake of completeness, in case you are not satisfied withthe magnitude of your pet disaster.”937 *“Perhaps next year,” said Albus. “My dearest friends, the question before us is whether Harry Potter has spirited Bellatrix Black out of Azkaban, which is more than youthful high spirits even by my tolerant standards.”“Excuse me, Headmaster,” Severus said with one of the dryer smilesshe had ever seen him deliver to Albus, “but I will register my opinion thatthe answer is no. This is the Dark Lord’s work, pure and simple.”“Then why,” Albus said, and now there was no humor at all in his voice,“when I planned to retrieve Harry immediately after his arrival in DiagonAlley, did I find that this would result in paradox?”Minerva sank further back into her chair, dropped her left elbow ontothe hard uncushioned armrest, leaned her head into her hand, and shuther eyes in despair.There was a narrowly circulated proverb to the effect that only oneAuror in thirty was qualified to investigate cases involving Time-Turners;and that of those few, the half who weren’t already insane, soon would be.“So you suspect,” Severus’s voice was saying, “that Potter went fromDiagon Alley to Azkaban, then looped back to Diagon Alley afterward tobe picked up by us—”“Precisely,” said Albus’s voice. “Though it is also possible that Voldemort or his servants watched to make sure Harry did arrive in DiagonAlley, before they began their attempt on Azkaban. And that they hadsomeone with a Time-Turner who would send back the message of theirsuccess, to trigger the abduction. Indeed, it was my suspicion of this possibility that caused me to dispatch you and Minerva on your own mission, before I myself went to Azkaban. I thought then that their breakout would fail, but if retrieving Harry Potter meant observing the fact oftheir eventual failure, then I myself could not have gone to Azkaban after I had interacted with him, for Azkaban’s future cannot touch its past.When, in Azkaban, I received no report from you or Minerva, nor fromFlitwick whom I told to try contacting you, I knew that your interactionwith Harry Potter had been an interaction with Azkaban’s future, meaning that someone was sending messages through Time—”Then Albus’s voice stopped.938 *“But Headmaster,” said Severus, “you came back from Azkaban’s future and interacted with us…”The Potions Master’s voice trailed off.“But Severus, if I had received reports from you and Minerva of Harry’ssafety, I would not, in the first place, have gone backward in time to—”“Headmaster, I think we must draw diagrams for this.”“I agree, Severus.”There was the sound of parchment being spread on a table, and thenquills scratching, and more arguing.Minerva sat in her chair, head resting in her hand, eyes shut.There was a story she’d once heard about a criminal who had possessed a Time-Turner which the Department of Mysteries had sealed tohim, in a case of extremely bad judgment as to who needed one; and therehad been an Auror assigned to track down this unknown time-criminal,who had also been given a Time-Turner; and the story ended with both ofthem in St. Mungo’s ward for Total Unrecoverable Nutcases.Minerva sat there with her eyes shut, trying not to listen, trying notto think about it, and trying not to go insane.After awhile, when the argument seemed to have wound down, shesaid aloud, “Mr. Potter’s Time-Turner is restricted to the hours of ninePM through midnight. Was the shell tampered with, Albus?”“Not to my most discerning Charms,” said Albus. “But the shells arenew things; and to defeat the Unspeakables’ precautions and leave notrace of the defeat… might not be impossible.”She opened her eyes, and saw Severus and the Headmaster staringintently at a parchment covered with tangled squiggles that would haveno doubt driven her mad to comprehend.“Have you come to any conclusions?” Minerva said. “And please don’ttell me how you arrived at them.”Severus and the Headmaster looked at each other, then turned to lookat her.“We have concluded,” the Headmaster said gravely, “that either Harrywas involved or he was not; that either Voldemort has access to a TimeTurner or he does not; and that regardless of what could have happenedwithin Azkaban, nobody would have visited the Little Hangleton grave*939 *yard during the period Moody has already watched over it within my ownpast.”“In short,” Severus drawled, “we know nothing, dear Minerva; thoughit seems at least likely that another Time-Turner was involved, somehow.My own suspicion is that Potter has been bribed, tricked, or threatenedinto conveying messages backward in time, perhaps even regarding thisvery prison break. I shall not make the obvious suggestion as to who ispulling his strings. But I suggest that at nine o’ clock tonight, we testwhether Potter is able to travel the full six hours backward to three o’ clock,to see if he has yet used his Time-Turner.”“That seems wise to do in any case,” said Dumbledore. “See that done,Minerva, and tell Harry to stop in my office at his convenience, afterward.”“But you still suspect Harry of direct involvement in the prison breakitself?” Minerva said.“Possible but unlikely,” said Severus, at the same time Albus said,“Yes.”Minerva pinched the bridge of her nose, took a deep breath, let it out.“Albus, Severus, what possible reason has Mr. Potter to do such a thing!”“None that I can think of,” said Albus, “but it remains that Harry’smagics alone, of all the means known to me, might have—”“Hold,” said Severus. All expression vanished from his face. “Athought occurs to me, I must check—” The Potions Master seized a pinchof Floo powder, strode across the room toward the fireplace—Albushastily waved his wand to light it—and then in a flare of green flame,and the words “Slytherin Head of House office”, Severus was gone.She and Albus looked at each other and both shrugged; and then Albusturned back to studying the parchment.It was only a few minutes later that Severus spun back out of the Floo,brushing traces of ash from himself.“Well,” said the Potions Master. Again the expressionless face. “I amafraid that Mr. Potter does have a motive.”“Speak!” said Albus.“I found Lesath Lestrange in the Slytherin common room, studying,”Severus said. “He was not reluctant to meet my eyes. And it seems thatMr. Lestrange did not like to think of his parents in Azkaban, in the coldand the darkness, with the Dementors sucking away their life, hurtingevery second of every day, and he told Mr. Potter so in as many words,and begged him to get them out. Since, you see, Mr. Lestrange had heardthat the Boy-Who-Lived could do anything.”She and Albus exchanged glances.“Severus,” Minerva said, “surely… even Harry… has more commonsense than that…”Her voice trailed off.“Mr. Potter thinks he is God,” Severus said without expression, “andLesath Lestrange fell to his knees before him in a heartfelt cry of prayer.”Minerva stared at Severus, feeling sick to her stomach. She hadstudied Muggle religion—it was the most common reason for needingto Memory-Charm the parents of Muggleborns—and she knew enoughto understand what Severus had just said.“In any case,” said the Potions Master. “I looked within Mr. Lestrangeto see if he knew anything of his mother’s escape. He has heard nothing.But the instant he learns, he will conclude that the person responsiblewas Harry Potter.”“I see…” Albus said slowly. “Thank you, Severus. That is good news.”“Good news?” Minerva burst out.Albus looked at her, his face as expressionless as Severus’s, now; andshe remembered, with a shock, that Albus’s own—“It is the best reasonI can possibly imagine for removing Bellatrix from Azkaban,” Albus saidquietly. “And if it is not Harry, let us recall, then it is certainly Voldemorthimself making his first moves. But let us not be hasty in judgment whilethere is much we do not yet know, but soon will.”Albus once more stood up from behind his desk, strode to the fireplace still alight, cast in another pinch of green powder, and stuck hishead into the flames. “Department of Magical Law Enforcement,” he said,“Director’s office.”After a moment, the voice of Madam Bones came through clear andsharp, “What is it, Albus? I am somewhat busy.”“Amelia,” said Albus, “I beg of you to share any discoveries you havemade concerning this matter.”There was a pause. “Oh,” said the cold voice of Madam Bones fromthe blazing fire, “and is that a two-way road then, Albus?”“It may be,” the old wizard said calmly.“If any Auror dies of your reticence, old meddler, I will hold you responsible in full measure.”“I understand, Amelia,” Albus said, “but I have no wish to spark needless alarm and incredulity—”“Bellatrix Black has escaped from Azkaban! What alarm or incredulitydo you think I will call needless, in the face of that?”“I may call on you to remember those words,” said the old wizard intothe green flames. “For if I learn that my fears are not needless, I will tellyou. Now, Amelia, I beg you, if you have learned anything whatsoeverupon this matter, please share it.”There was another pause, and then Madam Bones’s voice said, “I haveinformation which I learned four hours into the future, Albus. Do you stillwant it?”Albus paused—(weighing, Minerva knew, the possibility that he might want to goback more than two hours from this instant; for you couldn’t send information further back in time than six hours, not through any chain ofTime-Turners)—and finally said, “Yes, please.”“We had a lucky break,” said Madam Bones’s voice, “one of the Aurors who witnessed the escape was a Muggleborn, and she told us thatthe Flying-Fire spell, as we were calling it, might be no spell at all, but aMuggle artifact.”Like a punch in the stomach, that was how it felt, and the sickness inMinerva’s belly redoubled. Anyone who’d watched a Chaos Legion battleknew whose hand that showed…Madam Bones’s voice continued. “We brought in Arthur Weasleyfrom Misuse of Muggle Artifacts—he knows more about Muggle artifacts than any wizard alive—and gave him the descriptions from theAurors on the scene, and he cracked it. It was a Muggle artifact called arocker, and they call it that because you’d have to be off your rocker toride one. Just six years ago one of their rockers blew up, killed hundreds942 *of Muggles in a flash and almost set fire to the Moon. Weasley says thatrockers use a special kind of science called opposite reaction, so the planis to develop a jinx which will prevent that science from working aroundAzkaban.”“Thank you, Amelia,” Albus said gravely. “Is that everything?”“I’ll check if we have anything from six hours forward,” said the voiceof Madam Bones, “if so they wouldn’t have told me, but I’ll have them tellyou. Do you have anything you want to tell me, Albus? Which of those twopossibilities is it looking like?”“Not yet, Amelia,” Albus said, “but I may have word for you soon.”He straightened up from the fire, then, which faded back to ordinaryyellow flames. Every minute of the old wizard’s years, every natural second since his birth and every second which Time-Turning had added, allof that plus a few extra decades for stress, was visible on his lined face.“Severus?” the old wizard said. “What was it actually?”“A rocket,” said the half-blood Potions Master, who had grown up inthe Muggle town of Spinner’s End. “One of the most impressive Muggletechnologies.”“How likely is Harry to know such arts?” said Minerva.Severus drawled, “Oh, a boy like Mr. Potter knows all about rockets;that, dear Minerva, is a certainty. You must remember that things aredone differently in the Muggle world.” Severus frowned. “But rockets aredangerous, and expensive…”“Harry has stolen and hidden an unknown amount of money fromhis Gringotts vault, perhaps thousands of Galleons,” said the Headmaster, and then, to their twin stares, “That was not in my plan, but Imade the mistake of sending the Defense Professor to supervise Harry’swithdrawal of five Galleons for Christmas presents…” The Headmastershrugged. “Yes, I agree, sheer folly in retrospect, let us continue.”Minerva quietly thudded her head a few times against the headrest ofher chair.“Nonetheless, Headmaster,” Severus said. “Just because the DeathEaters never used Muggle artifacts in the first war, that does not meanhe is ignorant. Rockets fell on Britain as weapons, in the Muggle side ofGrindelwald’s war. If he spent the summers of those years in a Muggle or*943 *phanage, as you told us, Headmaster… then he, too, has heard of rockets.And if he has been listening to reports of Mr. Potter and his mock battlesusing Muggle artifacts, he would certainly learn his enemy’s strengthsand try to redouble them himself. That is just how he thinks; any powerhe sees he will try to take for his own.”The old wizard was standing stock still, utterly motionless, even thehairs of his beard frozen in place like solid wires; and the thought came toMinerva, as frightening as any thought she’d ever had, that Albus Dumbledore was rooted to the spot in horror.“Severus,” Albus Dumbledore said, and his voice almost cracked, “doyou realize what you are saying? If Harry Potter and Voldemort fight theirwar with Muggle weapons there will be nothing left of the world but fire!”“What?” said Minerva. She had heard of guns, of course, but theyweren’t that dangerous to an experienced witch—Severus spoke as though she weren’t in the room. “Then perhaps,Headmaster, he is sending a deliberate warning to Harry Potter of exactly that; saying that any attack with Muggle weapons will be met withretaliation in kind. Command Mr. Potter to cease his use of Muggle technology in his battles; that will show him the message is received… and notgive him any more ideas.” Severus frowned. “Though, come to think ofit, Mr. Malfoy—and of course Miss Granger—well, on second thought ablanket prohibition on technology seems wiser—”The old wizard pressed both his hands to his forehead, and from hislips came an unsteady voice, “I begin to hope that it is Harry behind thisescape… oh, Merlin defend us all, what have I done, what have I done,what will become of the world?”Severus shrugged. “From the rumors I have heard, Headmaster, Muggle weapons are only slightly worse than the more… recondite aspects ofwizardry—”“Worse?” gasped Minerva, and then shut her mouth as though byforce.“Worse than any peril left in these fading years,” said Albus. “Notworse than that which erased Atlantis from Time.”Minerva stared at him, feeling the sweat break out all along her spine.944 *Severus continued, still addressing Albus. “All the Death Eaters saveBellatrix would have betrayed him, all his supporters turned against him,all the powers of the world converged to destroy him, if he had been reckless with any truly dangerous potency. Is this so different, then?”Some motion, some color, had returned to the old wizard’s face. “Perhaps not…”“And in any case,” Severus said with a slightly condescending smile,“Muggle weapons are not so easy to obtain, not for a thousand Galleonsor a thousand thousand.”Doesn’t Harry just Transfigure the devices he uses in his battles? thoughtMinerva, but before she could open her mouth to ask—The fireplace erupted in green flames, then, and the face of PiusThicknesse, Madam Bones’s assistant, appeared therein. “Chief Warlock?” said Thicknesse. “I have a report for you, transmitted from—”Thicknesse’s eyes flickered over Minerva and Severus, “six minutes ago.”“Six hours ahead, you mean,” said Albus. “These two are meant to hearit; deliver your report.”“We know how it was done,” said Thicknesse. “In Bellatrix Black’s cell,hidden in one corner, was a potions vial; and testing the traces of remaining fluid shows that it was an Animagus potion.”There was a long pause.“I see…” Albus said heavily.“Pardon me?” said Minerva. She didn’t.Thicknesse’s head turned toward her. “Animagi, Madam McGonagall,in their Animagus forms, are of less interest to Dementors. All prisonersare tested before their arrival at Azkaban; and if they are Animagi, theirAnimagus form is destroyed. But we had not considered that someoneprotected by a Patronus Charm while taking the potion and performingthe meditation, might be able to become an Animagus after they went toAzkaban—”“I understood,” Severus said, having by now put on his customarysneer, “that the Animagus meditation required considerable time.”“Well, Mr. Snape,” Thicknesse barked, “records show that BellatrixBlack was an Animagus before she was sentenced to Azkaban and her form945 *destroyed; so maybe her second meditation didn’t take as much time as herfirst!”“I would not have thought it possible for any prisoner of Azkaban to dosuch a thing…” Albus said. “But Bellatrix Black was a most powerful sorceress before her incarceration, and she might have done it if any witchcould. Can Azkaban be secured against this method?”“Yes,” said the confident head of Pius Thicknesse. “Our expert saysthat it is nigh-unimaginable that an Animagus meditation could be performed in less than three hours, regardless of experience. All visits toprisoners allowed to receive them will be limited to two hours henceforth,and the Dementors will inform us if any Patronus Charm is maintainedin the prison areas for longer than that.”Albus looked unhappy at that, but nodded. “I see. There will be nofurther attempts of that sort, of course, but do not relax your vigilance.And when Amelia has been told all this, tell her that I have informationfor her.”The head of Pius Thicknesse vanished without another word.“No further attempts…?” said Minerva.“Because, dear Minerva,” Severus drawled, having not quite taken offhis habitual sneer, “if the Dark Lord had planned to free any of his otherservants from Azkaban, he would not have left behind the vial of potionto tell us how it was done.” Severus frowned. “I confess… even so I do notsee why that vial was left there.”“It is some kind of message…” Albus said slowly. “And I cannot seewhat it means, not at all…” He drummed his fingers on his desk.For a long minute or three, the old wizard stared off into nothingness,frowning; while Severus also sat in silence.Then Albus shook his head in dismay, and said, “Severus, do you comprehend this?”“No,” said the Potions Master, and with a sardonic smile, “which isprobably all the better for us; whatever we are intended to conclude fromit, that part of his plan has misfired.”“You are certain, now, that it is You-Know… that it is Voldemort?” saidMinerva. “It could not be that some other Death Eater conceived thisclever notion?”946 *“And they knew about rockets, too?” Severus said dryly. “I don’t believe the other Death Eaters were so fond of Muggle Studies. It is he.”“Aye, it is he,” Albus said. “Azkaban has endured impenetrable forages, only to fall to an ordinary Animagus potion. It is too clever and tooimpossible, which was ever Voldemort’s signature since the days he wasknown as Tom Riddle. Anyone who wished to forge that signature mustneeds be as cunning as Voldemort himself to do so. And there is no oneelse in the world who would accidentally overestimate my wit, and leaveme a message I cannot understand at all.”“Unless he has gauged you exactly,” Severus said tonelessly, “in whichcase all that is just what he intended you to think.”Albus sighed. “Indeed. But even if he has tricked me perfectly, wemay at least rely on the conclusion that it was not Harry Potter.”It should have come as a relief, and yet Minerva felt the chill spreadingthrough her spine and her veins, her lungs and her bones.She remembered conversations like this.She remembered conversations like this from ten years ago, from atime when blood had run through Britain in wide rivers, when wizardsand witches she had once taught in class had been slaughtered by thehundreds, she remembered burning homes and screaming children andflashes of green light—“What will you tell Madam Bones?” she whispered.Albus stood from his desk and paced to the center of the room, hishand lightly touching the devices, here an instrument of light, there an instrument of sound; he adjusted his glasses with one hand, used the otherto center the long silver beard against his robes, and then finally that ancient wizard turned back and faced them.“I will tell her what little I know of the Dark Art called horcrux, bywhich a soul is deprived of death,” said Albus Dumbledore, in a soft voicethat seemed to fill the whole room, “and I will tell her what may be donewith the flesh of the servant.”“I will tell her that I am reconstituting the Order of the Phoenix.”“I will tell her that Voldemort has returned.”“And that the Second Wizarding War is begun.”947 *Some hours later…The antique old clock upon the wall of the Deputy Headmistress’soffice had golden hands, and silver numerals to make the clock-face;it ticked and jerked soundlessly through its motions, for there was aQuieting enchantment on it.The golden hour hand approached the silver numeral of nine, thegolden minute hand did the same, the two linked components of Timenearing each other, soon to be in the same place and never to collide.It was 8:43 pm, and the time approached when Harry’s Time-Turnerwould open, to be tested in the one way that no imaginable spell couldfool, unless that spell could bypass the laws of Time itself. No body orsoul, no knowledge or substance, could stretch an extra seven hours ina single day. She would make up a message on the spot, and tell Harryto take that message back six hours to Professor Flitwick at 3pm, and shewould ask Professor Flitwick if he had received it in that hour.And Professor Flitwick would tell her that he had indeed received it at3pm.And she would tell Severus and Albus to have a little more faith inHarry next time.Professor McGonagall cast the Patronus Charm, and told her shiningcat, “Go to Mr. Potter, and tell him this: Mr. Potter, please come to my office as soon as you hear this, without doing anything else along the way.”948 *inerva gazed up at the clock, the golden hands and silver numerals,the jerking motion. Muggles had invented that, and until theyhad, wizards had not bothered keeping time. Bells, timed by a sandedhourglass, had served Hogwarts for its classes when it was built. It wasone of the things that blood purists wished not to be true, and thereforeMinerva knew it.She had received an Outstanding on her Muggle Studies N.E.W.T.,which now seemed to her a mark of shame, considering how little sheknew. Her younger self had realized, even then, that the class was a sham,taught by a pureblood, supposedly because Muggleborns could not appreciate what wizardborns needed to be told, and actually because the Boardof Governors did not approve of Muggles at all. But when she was seventeen the Outstanding grade had been the main thing that mattered to her,she was saddened to remember…If Harry Potter and Voldemort fight their war with Muggle weapons there willbe nothing left of the world but fire!She couldn’t imagine it, and the reason she couldn’t imagine it wasthat she couldn’t imagine Harry fighting You-Know-Who.She had encountered the Dark Lord four times and survived each one,three times with Albus to shield her and once with Moody at her side.She remembered the damaged, snakelike face, the faint green scales scattered over the skin, the glowing red eyes, the voice that laughed in a highpitched hiss and promised nothing but cruelty and torment: the monsterpure and complete.949 *And Harry Potter was easy to picture in her mind, the bright expression on the face of a young boy who wavered between taking the ludicrousseriously and taking the serious ludicrously.And to think of the two of them facing off at wandpoint was toopainful to be imagined.They had no right, no right at all to set this on an eleven-year-old boy.She knew what the Headmaster had decided for him this day, for she hadbeen told to make the arrangements; and if it had been her at the sameage she would have raged and screamed and cried and been inconsolablefor weeks, and…He is no ordinary first-year, Albus had said. He is marked as the Dark Lord’sequal, and he has power the Dark Lord knows not.The terrible hollow voice booming from Sybill Trelawney’s throat, thetrue and original prophecy, echoed once more through her mind. She hada feeling it didn’t mean what the Headmaster thought it did, but therewas no way to put the difference into words.And even so it still seemed true, that if there were any eleven-year-oldwithin the Earth entire who could bear this burden, that boy approachedher office now. And if she said anything at all like ‘poor Harry’ to his face…well, he wouldn’t like it.So now I’ve got to find some way to kill an immortal Dark Wizard, Harryhad said on the day he had first learned. I really wish you had told me thatbefore I started shopping…She’d been Head of House Gryffindor for long enough, she’d watchedenough friends die, to know that there were some people you couldn’tsave from becoming heroes.There came a knock at the door, and Professor McGonagall said, “Enter.”When Harry entered, his face had the same cold, alert look she’d seenin Mary’s Place; and she wondered for an instant if he’d been wearing thatsame mask, that same self, this whole day.The young boy seated himself on the chair before her desk, and said,“So is it time for me to be told what’s going on?” Neutral the words, notthe sharpness that should have gone with the expression.950 *Professor McGonagall’s eyes rose in surprise before she could stopthem, and she said, “The Headmaster told you nothing, Mr. Potter?”The boy shook his head. “Only that he’d received a warning that Imight be in danger, but I was safe now.”Minerva was having trouble meeting his gaze. How could they do thisto him, how could they lay this upon an eleven-year-old boy, this war, thisdestiny, this prophecy… and they didn’t even trust him…She forced herself to look at Harry directly, and saw that his greeneyes were calm as they rested on her.“Professor McGonagall?” the boy said quietly.“Mr. Potter,” said Professor McGonagall, “I’m afraid it is not my placeto explain, but if after this the Headmaster still does not tell you anything,you may come back to me and I will go yell at him for you.”The boy’s eyes widened, something of the real Harry showing throughthe crack before the cool mask was set back in place.“In any case,” Professor McGonagall said briskly. “I’m sorry for theinconvenience, Mr. Potter, but I need to ask you to use your Time-Turnerto go back six hours to three o’clock, and give the following message toProfessor Flitwick: Silver on the tree. Ask the Professor to note down thetime at which you gave him that message. Afterward the Headmasterwishes to meet with you at your convenience.”There was a pause.Then the boy said, “I am suspected of misusing my Time-Turner,then?”“Not by me!” Professor McGonagall said hastily. “I am sorry for theinconvenience, Mr. Potter.”There was another pause, and then the young boy shrugged. “It’ll playhob with my sleep schedule but I suppose it can’t be helped. Please let thehouse elves know that if I ask for an early breakfast at, say, three A.M.tomorrow morning, I’m to receive it.”“Of course, Mr. Potter,” she said. “Thank you for understanding.”The boy rose up from his chair and gave her a formal nod, then slippedout the door with his hand already going under his shirt to where hisTime-Turner waited; and she almost called out Harry! only she wouldn’thave known what to say after.Instead she waited, her eyes on the clock.How long did she need to wait for Harry Potter to go back in time?She didn’t need to wait at all, actually; if he had done it, then it hadalready happened…Minerva knew, then, that she was delaying because she was nervous,and the realization saddened her. Mischief, yes, unspeakable unthinkable mischief with all the prudence and foresight of a falling rock—shedidn’t know how the boy had tricked the Hat into not Sorting him to Gryffindor where he obviously belonged—but nothing dark or harmful, notever. Beneath that mischief his goodness ran as deep and as true as theWeasley twins’, though not even the Cruciatus Curse could have gottenher to say that out loud.“Expecto Patronum,” she said, and then, “Go to Professor Flitwick, andbear back his reply after you ask him this: ‘Did Mr. Potter give you a message from me, what was that message, and when did you receive it?’”One hour earlier, having used the last remaining spin of his Time-Turnerafter putting on the Cloak of Invisibility, Harry tucked the hourglass backinto his shirt.And he set out toward the Slytherin dungeons, striding as quicklyas his invisible legs could manage, though not running. Thankfully theDeputy Headmistress’s office was already on a lower floor of Hogwarts…A few staircases later, taken two steps but not three steps at once,Harry stopped at a corridor around whose final bend lay the entrance tothe Slytherin dorms.Harry took a piece of parchment (not paper) out of his parch, took aQuotes Quill (not pen) out of his pouch, and told the quill, “Write theseletters exactly as I say them: Z-P-G-B-S-Y, space, F-V-Y-I-R-E-B-A-G-U-RG-E-R-R.”There were two kinds of codes in cryptography, codes that stoppedyour little brother from reading your message and codes that stopped major governments from reading your message, and this was the first kind952 *of code, but it was better than nothing. In theory, no one should read itanyway; but even if they did, they wouldn’t remember anything interesting unless they did cryptography first.Harry then put that parchment in a parchment envelope, and with hiswand melted a little green wax to seal it.In principle, of course, Harry could’ve done all that hours earlier, butsomehow waiting until after he heard the message from Professor McGonagall’s own lips seemed less like Messing With Time.Harry then put that envelope inside another envelope, which alreadycontained another sheet of paper with other instructions, and five silverSickles.He closed that envelope (which already had a name written on theoutside), sealed it with more green wax, and pressed a final Sickle intothat seal.Then Harry put that envelope into the very last envelope on which waswritten in large letters the name “Merry Tavington”.And Harry peeked around the bend to where the scowling portraitthat served as the door to the Slytherin dorms waited; and as he did notwish the portrait to recall not-seeing anyone invisible, Harry used theHover Charm to float the envelope to the scowling man, and tap it againsthim.The scowling man looked down at the envelope, peering at it througha monocle, and sighed, and turned around to face toward the inside ofthe Slytherin dorms, and called, “Message for Merry Tavington!”The envelope was then allowed to fall to the floor.A few moments later the portrait door opened, and Merry snatchedup the envelope from the floor.She would open it up and find a Sickle and an envelope addressed toa fourth-year student named Margaret Bulstrode.(Slytherins did this sort of thing all the time, and a Sickle definitelyconstituted a rush order.)Margaret would open her envelope, and find five Sickles along withan envelope to be dropped off in an unused classroom……after she used her Time-Turner to go back five hours…953 *…whereupon she would find another five Sickles waiting for her, ifshe got there quickly.And an invisible Harry Potter would be waiting in that classroomfrom three PM to three-thirty, just in case someone tried the obvioustest.Well, it had been obvious to Professor Quirrell, anyway.It had also been obvious to Professor Quirrell that (a) Margaret Bulstrode had a Time-Turner and (b) she wasn’t very strict about how sheused it, e.g. telling her younger sister really good pieces of gossip “before”anyone else had heard.Some of the tension leaked off Harry as he strode away from the portrait door, still invisible. Somehow his mind had still managed to worryabout the plan, even knowing that it had already succeeded. Now thereremained only the confrontation with Dumbledore, and then he wasdone for the day… he’d go to the Headmaster’s gargoyles at 9pm, sincedoing it at 8pm would seem more suspicious. This way he could claimthat he’d just misunderstood what Professor McGonagall had meant by“afterward”…The obscure pain clutched at Harry’s heart again as he thought of Professor McGonagall.So Harry retreated a little further into his dark side, which had wornthe calm expression and kept the fatigue off his face, and kept walking.There would come a reckoning, but sometimes you had to borrow everything you could today, and let the payments come due tomorrow.Even Harry’s dark side was feeling the exhaustion by the time the spiraling staircase had delivered him to the great oaken door that was the finalgate to Dumbledore’s office; but since Harry was now legally four hourspast his natural bedtime, it was safe to let some of the fatigue show, thephysical if not the emotional.The oaken door swung open—954 *Harry’s eyes had already been focused in the direction of the greatdesk, the throne behind it; so it took a moment to register that the thronewas empty, the desk barren but for a single leatherbound volume; andthen Harry shifted his gaze to see the wizard standing among his fiddly things, the mysterious unknown devices in their scores. Fawkes andthe Sorting Hat occupied their respective perches, a bright cheerful blazecrackled in a nook that Harry had not before realized was a fireplace, andthere were the two umbrellas and three red slippers for left feet. All thingsin their place and in their customary appearance except the old wizardhimself, standing tall and dressed in robes of the most formal black. Itcame as a shock to the eyes, those robes on that person, it was as if Harryhad seen his father wearing a business suit.Very ancient was the appearance of Albus Dumbledore, and sorrowful.“Hello, Harry,” said the old wizard.From within an alternate self maintained like an Occlumency construct, an innocent-Harry who had absolutely no idea what was happening inclined his head coldly, and said, “Headmaster. I expect you’ve heardback from Deputy Headmistress McGonagall by now, so if it’s fine by you,I would really like to know what is going on.”“Yes,” said the old wizard, “it is time, Harry Potter.” The back straightened, only slightly for the wizard had already been standing straight; butsomehow even that small change made the wizard seem a foot taller, andstronger if not younger, formidable though not dangerous, his potencygathered about him like a cowl. In a clear voice, then, he spoke: “This dayyour war against Voldemort has begun.”“What?” said the outer Harry who knew nothing, while somethingwatching from inside thought much the same only with a lot more profanity attached.“Bellatrix Black has been taken from Azkaban, she has escaped froma prison inescapable,” the old wizard said. “It is a feat that bears Voldemort’s signature if ever I have seen it; and she, his most faithful servant,is one of three requisites he must obtain to rise again in a new body. Afterten years the enemy you once defeated has returned, as was foretold.”955 *Neither part of Harry could think of anything to say to that, at leastnot for the few seconds before the old wizard continued.“It need change little for you, for now,” said the old wizard. “I havebegun reconstituting the Order of the Phoenix that will serve you, I havealerted the few souls who can and should understand: Amelia Bones,Alastor Moody, Bartemius Crouch, certain others. Of the prophecy—yes,there is a prophecy—I have not told them, but they know that Voldemortis returned, and they know that you are to play some vital role. They andI shall fight your war in its lesser beginnings, while you grow stronger,and perhaps wiser, here at Hogwarts.” The old wizard’s hand came up,as though beseeching. “So to you, for now, there is but one change, andI implore you to understand its necessity. Do you recognize the book onmy desk, Harry?”The inner part of Harry was screaming and banging its head againstimaginary walls, while the outer Harry turned and stared at what provedto be—There was a rather long pause.Then Harry said, “It is a copy of The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien.”“You recognized a quote from that book,” said Dumbledore, an intentlook in his eyes, “so I assume you remember it well. If I am mistaken, letme be corrected.”Harry just stared at him.“It is important to understand,” said Dumbledore, “that this book isnot a realistic depiction of a wizarding war. John Tolkien never foughtVoldemort. Your war will not be like the books you have read. Real life isnot like stories. Do you understand, Harry?”Harry, rather slowly, nodded yes; and then shook his head no.“In particular,” said Dumbledore, “there is a certain very foolishthing that Gandalf does in the first book. He makes many mistakes,does Tolkien’s wizard; but this one error is the most unforgivable. Thatmistake is this: When Gandalf first suspected, even for a moment, thatFrodo held the One Ring, he should have moved Frodo to Rivendell atonce. He might have been embarrassed, that old wizard, if his suspicionshad proven false. He might have found it awkward to so commandFrodo, and Frodo would have been greatly inconvenienced, needing to956 *set aside many other plans and pastimes. But a little embarrassment,and awkwardness, and inconvenience, is as nothing compared to theloss of your whole war, when the nine Nazgul swoop down on the Shirewhile you are reading old scrolls in Minas Tirith, and take the Ring atonce. And it is not Frodo alone who would have been hurt; all MiddleEarth would have fallen into slavery. If it had not been only a story, Harry,they would have lost their war. Do you understand what I am saying?”“Er…” said Harry, “not exactly…” There was something about Dumbledore when he was like this, which made it hard to stay properly cold; hisdark side had trouble with weird.“Then I will spell it out,” said the old wizard. His voice was stern,his eyes were sad. “Frodo should have been moved to Rivendell at onceby Gandalf himself—and Frodo should never have left Rivendell withoutguard. There should have been no night of terror in Bree, no Barrowdowns, no Weathertop where Frodo was wounded, they could have losttheir entire war any of those times, for Gandalf’s folly! Do you understand now what I am saying to you, son of Michael and Petunia?”And the Harry who knew nothing did understand.And the Harry who knew nothing saw that it was the smart, the wise,the intelligent and sane, the right thing to do.And the Harry who knew nothing said just what an innocent Harrywould have said, while the silent watcher screamed in confusion andagony.“You’re saying,” Harry said, his voice shaking as the emotions insideburned through the outer calm, “that I’m not going home to my parentsfor Easter.”“You will see them again,” the old wizard said swiftly. “I will beg themto come here to be with you, I will extend them every courtesy duringtheir visits. But you are not going home for Easter, Harry. You are notgoing home for the summer. You are no longer taking lunches in DiagonAlley, even with Professor Quirrell to watch you. Your blood is the secondrequisite Voldemort needs to rise as strong as before. So you are neveragain leaving the bounds of Hogwarts’s wards without a vital reason, anda guard strong enough to fend off any attack for long enough to get youto safety. ”957 *Water was beginning at the corners of Harry’s eyes. “Is that a request?” said his quavering voice. “Or an order?”“I’m sorry, Harry,” the old wizard said softly. “Your parents will seethe necessity, I hope; but if not… I am afraid they have no recourse; thelaw, however wrongly, does not recognize them as your guardians. I amsorry, Harry, and I will understand if you despise me for it, but it must bedone.”Harry whirled, looked at the door, he couldn’t look at Dumbledore anymore, couldn’t trust his own face.This is the cost to yourself, said Hufflepuff within his mind, even as youimposed costs on others. Will that change your whole view of the matter, the wayProfessor Quirrell thinks it will?Automatically, the mask of the innocent Harry said exactly what itwould have said: “Are my parents in danger? Do they need to be movedhere?”“No,” said the old wizard’s voice. “I do not think so. The Death Eaterslearned, toward the end of the war, not to attack the Order’s families. Andif Voldemort is now acting without his former companions, he still knowsthat it is I who make the decisions for now, and he knows that I would givehim nothing for any threat to your family. I have taught him that I do notgive in to blackmail, and so he will not try.”Harry turned back then, and saw a coldness on the old wizard’s face tomatch the shift in his voice, Dumbledore’s blue eyes grown hard as steelbehind the glasses, it didn’t match the person but it matched the formalblack robes.“Is that everything, then?” said Harry’s trembling voice. Later hewould think about this, later he would think of some cunning countermeasure, later he would ask Professor Quirrell if there was any way toconvince the Headmaster he was mistaken. Right now, maintaining themask was taking all of Harry’s attention.“Voldemort used a Muggle artifact to escape Azkaban,” the old wizardsaid. “He is watching you and learning from you, Harry Potter. Soon aman named Arthur Weasley at the Ministry will issue an edict that all useof Muggle artifacts must cease in the Defense Professor’s battles. In thefuture, when you have a good idea, keep it closer about yourself.”958 *It didn’t seem important by comparison. Harry just nodded, and saidagain, “Is that everything?”There was a pause.“Please,” said the old wizard in a whisper. “I have no right to askyour forgiveness, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, but please, at leastsay that you understand why.” There was water in the old wizard’s eyes.“I understand,” said the voice of the outer Harry who did understand,“I mean… I was sort of thinking about it anyway… wondering whether Icould get you and my parents to let me stay over at Hogwarts during thesummer like the orphans, so I could read the library here, it’s just moreinteresting at Hogwarts anyway…”A choking sound came from Albus Dumbledore’s throat.Harry turned again toward the door. It wasn’t escape unscathed, butit was escape.He took a step forward.His hand reached to the door-handle.A piercing cry split the air—As though in slow motion, as Harry spun, he saw the phoenix alreadylaunched through the air and winging toward him.From the true Harry, the one who knew his own guilt, came a flash ofpanic, he hadn’t thought of that, hadn’t anticipated it, he’d prepared toface Dumbledore but he’d forgotten about Fawkes—Flap, flap, and flap, three times the phoenix’s wings flapped like theflaring up and dying down of a fire, duration seemed to pass too slowlyas Fawkes soared over the mysterious devices toward where Harry stood.And the red-golden bird was hovering in front of him with gentlewing-sweeps, bobbing in the air like a candle-flame.“What is it, Fawkes?” said the false Harry in puzzlement, looking thephoenix in the eyes, as he would if he were innocent. The real Harry, feeling the same awful sickness inside as when Professor McGonagall hadexpressed her trust in him, thought, Did I turn evil today, Fawkes? I didn’tthink I was evil… Do you hate me now? If I’ve become something a phoenix hates,maybe I should just give it up now, give up everything now and confess—Fawkes screamed, the most terrible cry Harry had ever heard, ascream that set all the devices vibrating and made all the sleeping figures959 *start within their portraits.It pierced through all of Harry’s defenses like a white-hot swordthrough butter, collapsed all his layers like a punctured balloon popping,reshuffled his priorities in an instant as he remembered the one mostimportant thing; the tears began pouring freely from Harry’s eyes, downhis cheeks, his voice choked as the words came out of his throat likecoughing up lava—“Fawkes says,” Harry’s voice said, “he wants me, to do, something,about, the prisoners, in Azkaban—”“Fawkes, no!” said the old wizard. Dumbledore strode forward, reaching out to the phoenix with a pleading hand. The old wizard’s voice wasalmost as desperate as the phoenix’s scream had been. “You cannot askthat of him, Fawkes, he’s only a boy still!”“You went to Azkaban,” Harry whispered, “you took Fawkes with you,he saw—you saw—you were there, you saw—WHY DIDN’T YOU DO ANYTHING? WHY DIDN’T YOU LET THEM OUT?”When the instruments stopped vibrating, Harry realized that Fawkeshad screamed at the same time as his own scream, that the phoenix wasnow flying next to Harry and facing Dumbledore at his side, the redgolden head level with his own.“Can you,” whispered the old wizard, “can you truly hear the voice ofthe phoenix so clearly?”Harry was sobbing almost too hard to speak, for all the metal doorshe’d passed, the voices he’d heard, the worst memories, the desperatebegging as he walked away, all of it had burst into his mind like fire atthe phoenix’s scream, all the inner bulwarks smashed. Harry didn’t knowwhether he could truly hear the voice of the phoenix so clearly, whether hewould have understood Fawkes without already knowing. All Harry knewwas that he had a plausible excuse to say the things Professor Quirrell hadtold him he must never raise in conversation from this day forth; becausethis was just what an innocent Harry would have said, would have done,if he had heard so clearly. “They’re hurting—we have to help them—”“I can’t!” cried Albus Dumbledore. “Harry, Fawkes, I can’t, there’s nothing I can do!”Another piercing scream.The old wizard wrenched his gaze from the phoenix, his eyes meeting Harry’s instead. “Harry, tell Fawkes for me! Tell him it’s not that simple! Phoenixes aren’t mere animals but they are animals, Harry, they can’tunderstand—”“I don’t understand either,” Harry said, his voice trembling. “I don’tunderstand why you’re feeding people to Dementors! Azkaban isn’t a prison,it’s a torture chamber and you’re torturing those people to DEATH!”“Percival,” said the old wizard hoarsely, “Percival Dumbledore, myown father, Harry, my own father died in Azkaban! I know, I know it is ahorror! But what would you have of me? To break Azkaban by force? Wouldyou have me declare open rebellion against the Ministry?”There was a pause, and Harry’s trembling voice said, “Fawkes doesn’tknow anything about governments, he just wants you—to take the prisoners out—of their cells—and he’ll help you fight, if anyone stands inyour way—and—and so will I, Headmaster! I’ll go with you and destroyany Dementor that comes near! We’ll worry about the political falloutafterward, I bet that you and I together could get away with it—”“Harry,” whispered the old wizard, “phoenixes do not understandhow winning a battle can lose a war.” Tears were streaming down theold wizard’s cheeks, dripping into his silver beard. “The battle is all theyknow. They are good, but not wise. That is why they choose wizards tobe their masters.”“Can you bring out the Dementors to where I can get at them?”Harry’s voice was begging, now. “Bring them out in groups of fifteen—Ithink I could destroy that many at a time without hurting myself—”The old wizard shook his head. “It was hard enough to pass off theloss of one—they might give me one more, but never two—they are considered national possessions, Harry, weapons in case of war—”Fury blazed in Harry then, blazed up like fire, it might have come fromwhere a phoenix now rested on his own shoulder, and it might have comefrom his own dark side, and the two angers mixed within him, the coldand the hot, and it was a strange voice that said from his throat, “Tellme something. What does a government have to do, what do the votershave to do with their democracy, what do the people of a country have todo, before I ought to decide that I’m not on their side any more?”The old wizard’s eyes widened where he stared at the boy with aphoenix upon his shoulder. “Harry… are those your words, or the Defense Professor’s—”“Because there has to be some point, doesn’t there? And if it’s not Azkaban, where is it, then?”“Harry, listen, please, hear me! Wizards could not live together if theyeach declared rebellion against the whole, every time they differed! Always there will be something—”“Azkaban is not just something! It’s evil!”“Yes, even evil! Even some evils, Harry, for wizards are not perfectlygood! And yet it is better that we live in peace, than in chaos; and for youand I to break Azkaban by force would be the beginning of chaos, can younot see it?” The old wizard’s voice was pleading. “And it is possible tooppose the will of your fellows openly or in secret, without hating them,without declaring them evil and enemy! I do not think the people of thiscountry deserve that of you, Harry! And even if some of them did—whatof the children, what of the students in Hogwarts, what of the many goodpeople mixed in with the bad?”Harry looked on his shoulder at where Fawkes had perched, saw thephoenix’s eyes gazing back at him, they did not glow and yet they blazed,red flames in a sea of golden fire.What do you think, Fawkes?“Caw?” said the phoenix.Fawkes didn’t understand the conversation.The young boy looked at the old wizard, and said in a thick voice, “Ormaybe the phoenixes are wiser than us, smarter than us, maybe they follow us around hoping that someday we’ll listen to them, someday we’ll getit, someday we’ll just take, the prisoners, out, of their cells—”Harry spun and pulled open the oaken door and stepped onto thestaircase and slammed the door behind him.The stairwell began rotating, Harry began descending, and he put hisface in his hands, and began to weep.962 *It wasn’t until he was halfway to the bottom that he noticed the difference, noticed the warmth still spreading through him, and realizedthat—“Fawkes?” Harry whispered.—the phoenix was still on his shoulder, perched there as he had seenhim a few times upon Dumbledore’s.Harry looked again into the eyes, red flames in golden fire.“You’re not my phoenix now… are you?”Caw!“Oh,” Harry said, his voice trembling a little, “I’m glad to hearthat, Fawkes, because I don’t think—the Headmaster—I don’t thinkhe deserves—”Harry stopped, took a breath.“I don’t think he deserves that, Fawkes, he was trying to do the rightthing…”Caw!“But you’re angry at him and trying to make a point. I understand.”The phoenix nestled his head against Harry’s shoulder, and the stonegargoyle walked smoothly aside to let Harry pass back into the corridorsof Hogwarts.963 *Aftermath, Hermione Granger:She was just starting to close up her books and put away her homework in preparation for sleep, Padma and Mandy stacking up their ownbooks across the table from her, when Harry Potter walked into theRavenclaw common room; and it was only then that she realized, shehadn’t seen him at all since breakfast.That realization was rapidly stomped-on by a much more startlingone.There was a golden-red winged creature on Harry’s shoulder, a brightbird of fire.And Harry looked sad and worn and really tired like the phoenix wasthe only thing keeping him on his feet, but there was still a warmth abouthim, if you crossed your eyes you might have thought you were lookingat the Headmaster somehow, that was the impression that went throughHermione’s mind even though it didn’t make any sense.Harry Potter trudged across the Ravenclaw common room, past sofasfull of staring girls, past cardgame-circles of staring boys, heading forher.In theory she wasn’t talking to Harry Potter yet, his week wasn’t upuntil tomorrow, but whatever was going on was clearly a whole lot moreimportant than that—965 *“Fawkes,” Harry said, just as she was opening her mouth, “that girlover there is Hermione Granger, she’s not talking to me right now because I’m an idiot, but if you want to be on a good person’s shoulder she’sbetter than me.”So much exhaustion and hurt in Harry Potter’s voice—But before she could figure out what to do about it, the phoenix hadglided off Harry’s shoulder like a fire creeping up a matchstick on fastforward, flashing toward her; there was a phoenix flying in front of herand staring at her with eyes of light and flame.“Caw?” asked the phoenix.Hermione stared at it, feeling like she was facing a question on a testshe’d forgotten to study for, the one most important question and she’dgone her whole life without studying for it, she couldn’t find anything tosay.“I’m—” she said. “I’m only twelve, I haven’t done anything yet—”The phoenix just glided gently around, rotating around one wingtiplike the being of light and air that it was, and soared back to Harry Potter’sshoulder, where it settled down quite firmly.“You silly boy,” said Padma across from her, looking like she was deciding whether to laugh or grimace, “phoenixes aren’t for smart girls whodo their homework, they’re for idiots who charge straight at five olderSlytherin bullies. There’s a reason why the Gryffindor colors are red andgold, you know.”There was a lot of friendly laughter in the Ravenclaw common room.Hermione wasn’t one of the laughing ones.Neither was Harry.Harry had put a hand over his face. “Tell Hermione I’m sorry,” hesaid to Padma, his voice almost fallen to a whisper. “Tell her I forgot thatphoenixes are animals, they don’t understand time and planning, theydon’t understand people who are going to do good things later—I’m notsure they understand really the notion of there being something that aperson is, all they see is what people do. Fawkes doesn’t know what twelvemeans. Tell Hermione I’m sorry—I shouldn’t have—it just all goes wrong,doesn’t it?”966 *Harry turned to go, the phoenix still on his shoulder, began slowlytrudging toward the staircase that led up to his dorm.And Hermione couldn’t leave it at that, she just couldn’t leave it at that.She didn’t know if it was her competition with Harry or something else.She just couldn’t leave it with the phoenix turning away from her.She had to—Her mind keyed a frantic question to the entirety of her excellentmemory, found just one thing—“I was going to run in front of the Dementor to try and save Harry!”she shouted a little desperately at the red-golden bird. “I mean, I actually did start running and everything! That was stupid and courageous,right?”With a warbling cry the phoenix launched itself from Harry’s shoulder again, back toward her like a spreading blaze, it circled her threetimes like she was the center of an inferno, and for just a moment its wingbrushed against her cheek, before the phoenix soared back to Harry.There was a hush in the Ravenclaw common room.“Told you so,” Harry said aloud, and then he started climbing thestairs up to his bedroom; he seemed to climb very quickly, like he wasvery light on his feet for some reason, so that in just a moment he andFawkes were gone.Hermione held up a trembling hand to her cheek where Fawkes hadbrushed her with his wing, a spot of warmth lingering there like that onesmall patch of skin had been very gently set on fire.She’d answered the question of the phoenix, she supposed, but it feltto her like she’d just barely squeaked by on the test, like she’d gotten a 62and she could’ve gotten 104 if she’d tried harder.If she’d tried at all.She hadn’t really been trying, when she thought about it.Just doing her homework—Who have you saved?967 *Aftermath, Fawkes:Nightmares, the boy had expected, screams and begging and howlinghurricanes of emptiness, the discharge of the horrors being laid downinto memory, and in that fashion, perhaps, becoming part of the past.And the boy knew that the nightmares would come.The next night, they would come.The boy dreamed, and in his dreams the world was on fire, Hogwartswas on fire, his home was on fire, the streets of Oxford were on fire, allablaze with golden flames that shone but did not consume, and all thepeople walking through the blazing streets were shining with white lightbrighter than the fire, like they were flames themselves, or stars.The other first-year boys came to bed, and saw it for themselves, thewonder whose rumor they had already heard, that in his bed Harry Potterlay silent and motionless, a gentle smile on his face, while perched onhis pillow a red-golden bird watched over him, with bright wings sweptabove him like a blanket pulled over his head.The reckoning had been put off one more night.Aftermath, Draco Malfoy:Draco straightened his robes, making sure the green trim wasstraight. He waved his wand over his own head and said a Charm thatFather had taught him while other children were still playing in mud, aCharm which ensured that not a single speck of lint or dust would dirtyhis wizard’s robes.Draco picked up the mysterious envelope that Father had owled him,and tucked it into his robes. He had already used Incendio and Everto onthe mysterious note.And then he headed off to breakfast, to seat himself on exactly thesame tick of the clock where the food appeared, if he could manage it, sothat it would seem like all others had been waiting on his appearance to968 *eat. Because when you were the scion of Malfoy you were first in everything, including breakfast, that was why.Vincent and Gregory were waiting for him outside the door of his private room, up even before he was—though not, of course, dressed quiteas sharply.The Slytherin common room was deserted, anyone who got up thisearly was heading straight to breakfast anyway.The dungeon halls were silent but for their own footsteps, empty andechoing.The Great Hall was a hubbub of alarm despite the relative few arrivals,some younger children crying, students running back and forth betweentables or standing in knots shouting at each other, a red-robed prefectwas standing in front of two green-trimmed students and yelling at themand Snape was striding toward the mess—The noise dimmed a little as people caught sight of Draco, as some ofthe faces turned to stare at him, and fell quiet.The food appeared on the tables. No one looked at it.And Snape spun on his heel, abandoning his target, and headedstraight toward Draco.A knot of fear clutched at Draco’s heart, had something happened toFather—no, surely Father would have told him—whatever was happening, why hadn’t Father told him—There were bags of fatigue beneath Snape’s eyes, Draco saw as theirHead of House came close, the Potions Master had never been a sharpdresser (that was an understatement) but his robes were even dirtier andmore disarrayed this morning, spotted with extra grease.“You haven’t heard?” hissed their Head of House as he came close.“For pity’s sake, Malfoy, don’t you have a newspaper delivered?”“What is it, Profe—”“Bellatrix Black was taken from Azkaban!”“What?” said Draco in shock, as Gregory behind him said somethinghe really shouldn’t have and Vincent just gasped.Snape was gazing at him with narrowed eyes, then nodded abruptly.“Lucius told you nothing, then. I see.” Snape gave a snort, turned away—969 *“Professor!” said Draco. The implications were just starting to dawnon him, his mind spinning frantically. “Professor, what should I do—Father didn’t instruct me—”“Then I suggest,” Snape said sneeringly, as he strode away, “that youtell them that, Malfoy, as your father intended!”Draco glanced back at Vincent and Gregory, though he didn’t knowwhy he was bothering, of course they looked even more confused than hedid.And Draco walked forward to the Slytherin table, and sat down at thefar end, which was still empty of sitters.Draco put a sausage omelet on his plate, began eating it with automatic motions.Bellatrix Black had been taken from Azkaban.Bellatrix Black had been taken from Azkaban…?Draco didn’t know what to make of that, it was as totally unexpectedas the Sun going out—well, the Sun would expectedly go out in six billionyears but this was as unexpected as the Sun going out tomorrow. Fatherwouldn’t have done it, Dumbledore wouldn’t have done it, no one shouldhave been able to do it—what did it mean—what use would Bellatrix beto anyone after ten years in Azkaban—even if she got strong again, whatuse was a powerful sorceress who was completely evil and insane and fanatically devoted to a Dark Lord who wasn’t around anymore?“Hey,” said Vincent from where he was sitting next to Draco, “I don’tunderstand, boss, why’d we do that?”“We didn’t do it, you dolt!” snapped Draco. “Oh, for Merlin’s sake,if even you think we—didn’t your father ever tell you any stories aboutBellatrix Black? She tortured Father once, she tortured your father, she’stortured everyone, the Dark Lord once told her to Crucio herself and shedid it! She didn’t do crazy things to inspire fear and obedience in the populace, she did crazy things because she’s crazy! She’s a bitch is what sheis!”“Oh, really?” said an incensed voice from behind Draco.Draco didn’t look up. Gregory and Vincent would be watching hisback.“I would’ve thought you’d be happy—”970 *“—to hear that a Death Eater had been freed, Malfoy!”Amycus Carrow had always been one of the other problem people; Father had once told Draco to make sure he was never alone in the sameroom with Amycus…Draco turned around and gave Flora and Hestia Carrow his Number Three Sneer, the one that said that he was in a Noble and Most Ancient House and they weren’t and yes, that mattered. Draco said in theirgeneral direction, certainly not deigning to address them in particular,“There’s Death Eaters and then there’s Death Eaters,” and then turnedback to his food.There were two furious huffs in unison, and then two pairs of shoesstormed off toward the other end of the Slytherin table.It was a few minutes later that Millicent Bulstrode ran up to them,visibly out of breath, and said, “Mr. Malfoy, did you hear?”“About Bellatrix Black?” said Draco. “Yeah—”“No, about Potter!”“What?”“Potter was going around with a phoenix on his shoulder last night,looking like he’d been dragged through ten leagues of mud, they say thatthe phoenix took him to Azkaban to try to stop Bellatrix and he fought aduel with her and they blew up half the fortress!”“What?” said Draco. “Oh, there is just no way that—”Draco stopped.He’d said that a number of times about Harry Potter and had startedto notice a trend.Millicent ran off to tell someone else.“You don’t really think—” said Gregory.“I honestly don’t know anymore,” said Draco.A few minutes later, after Theodore Nott had sat down across fromhim and William Rosier had gone to sit with the Carrow twins, Vincentnudged him and said, “There.”Harry Potter had entered the Great Hall.Draco watched him closely.There was no alarm on Harry’s face as he saw, no surprise or shock,he just looked…It was the same distant, self-absorbed look Harry wore when he wastrying to figure out the answer to a question Draco couldn’t understandyet.Draco hastily shoved himself up from the bench of the Slytherin table,saying “Stay behind,” and walked with all decorous speed toward Harry.Harry seemed to notice his approach just as the other boy was turningtoward the Ravenclaw table, and Draco——gave Harry one quick look——and then walked right past him, straight out of the Great Hall.It was a minute later that Harry peered around the corner of the smallstony nook where Draco had waited, it might not fool everyone but itwould create plausible deniability.“Quietus,” said Harry. “Draco, what—”Draco took the envelope out of his robes. “I have a message for youfrom Father.”“Huh?” said Harry, and took the envelope from Draco, and tore it openin a rather un-neat manner, and drew forth a sheet of parchment andunfolded it and—Harry gave a sharp intake of breath.Then Harry looked at Draco.Then Harry looked back down at the parchment.There was a pause.Harry said, “Did Lucius tell you to report on my reaction to this?”Draco paused for a moment, weighing, and then opened his mouth—“I see he did,” said Harry, and Draco cursed himself, he should’veknown better, only it had been hard to decide. “What are you going totell him?”“That you were surprised,” said Draco.“Surprised,” Harry said flatly. “Yeah. Good. Tell him that.”“What is it?” said Draco. And then, as he saw Harry looking conflicted,“If you’re dealing with Father behind my back—”And Harry, without a word, gave Draco the paper.It said:I know it was you.972 *“I was going to ask you that,” said Harry. “Have you got any idea what’sup with your Dad?”Draco stared at Harry.Then Draco said, “Did you do it?”“What?” said Harry. “What possible reason would I—how would I—”“Did you do it, Harry?”“No!” Harry said. “Of course not!”Draco had listened carefully, but he hadn’t detected any hesitation ortremor.So Draco nodded, and said, “I’ve got no idea what Father’s thinkingbut it can’t, I mean it can’t possibly be good. And, um… people are also saying…”“What,” said Harry warily, “are they saying, Draco?”“Did a phoenix really take you to Azkaban to try to stop Bellatrix Blackfrom escaping—”Aftermath: Neville LongbottomHarry had only just sat down at the Ravenclaw table for the first time,hoping to grab a quick bite of food. He knew he needed to go off andthink about things, but there was a tiny remaining bit of phoenix’s peace(even after the encounter with Draco) that he still wanted to cling to, somebeautiful dream of which he remembered nothing but the beauty; andthe part of him that wasn’t feeling peaceful was waiting for all the anvilsto finish dropping on him, so that when he went off to think and be byhimself for a while, he could batch-process all the disasters at once.Harry’s hand grasped a fork, lifted a bite of mashed potatoes towardhis mouth—And there was a shriek.Every now and then someone would shout when they heard the news,but Harry’s ears recognized this one—Harry was up from the bench in an instant, heading toward the Hufflepuff table, a horrible sick feeling dawning in the pit of his stomach. It973 *was one of those things he hadn’t considered when he’d decided to commit the crime, because Professor Quirrell had planned for no one to know;and now, afterward, Harry just—hadn’t thought of it—This, Hufflepuff said with bitter intensity, is also your fault.But by the time Harry got there, Neville was sitting down and eatingfried sausage patties with Snippyfig Sauce.The Hufflepuff boy’s hands were trembling, but he cut the food, andate it, without dropping it.“Hello, General,” Neville said, his voice wavering only slightly. “Didyou fight a duel with Bellatrix Black last night?”“No,” Harry said. His own voice was also wavery, for some reason.“Didn’t think so,” said Neville. There was a scraping sound as his knifecut the sausage again. “I’m going to hunt her down and kill her, can Icount on you to help?”There were startled gasps from the mass of Hufflepuffs who had gathered around Neville.“If she comes after you,” Harry said hoarsely, if it was all a terrible mistake, if it was all a lie, “I’ll defend you even with my life,” won’t let you get hurtfor what I did, no matter what, “but I won’t help you go after her, Neville,friends don’t help friends commit suicide.”Neville’s fork paused on the way to his mouth.Then Neville put the bite of food in his mouth, chewed again.And Neville swallowed it.And Neville said, “I didn’t mean right now, I mean after I graduate Hogwarts.”“Neville,” Harry said, keeping his voice under very careful control, “Ithink, even after you graduate, that might still be a just plain stupid idea.There’s got to be much more experienced Aurors tracking her—” oh, wait,that’s not good—“Listen to him!” said Ernie Macmillan, and then an older-looking Hufflepuff girl standing close to Neville said, “Nevvy, please, think about it,he’s right!”Neville stood up.Neville said, “Please don’t follow me.”974 *Neville walked away from all of them; Harry and Ernie reaching outinvoluntarily toward him, and some of the other Hufflepuffs as well.And Neville sat down at the Gryffindor table, and distantly (thoughthey had to strain to hear) they heard Neville say, “I’m going to hunt herdown and kill her after I graduate, anyone want to help?” and at leastfive voices said “Yes” and then Ron Weasley said loudly, “Get in line, youlot, I got an owl from Mum this morning, she says to tell everyone she’scalled dibs” and someone said “Molly Weasley against Bellatrix Black? Whodoes she even think she’s kidding—” and Ron reached over to a plate andhefted a muffin—Someone tapped Harry on the shoulder, and he turned around andsaw an unfamiliar green-trimmed older girl, who handed him a parchment envelope and then quickly strode away.Harry stared at the envelope for a moment, then started walking toward the nearest wall. That wasn’t very private, but it should be privateenough, and Harry didn’t want to give the impression of having much tohide.That had been a Slytherin System delivery, what you used if youwanted to communicate with someone without anyone else knowingthat the two of you had talked. The sender gave an envelope to someonewho had a reputation for being a reliable messenger, along with tenKnuts; that first person would take five Knuts and pass the envelopeto another messenger along with the other five Knuts, and the secondmessenger would open up that envelope and find another envelope witha name written on it and deliver that envelope to that person. That wayneither of the two people passing the message knew both the sender andthe recipient, so no one else knew that those two parties had been incontact…When Harry reached the wall, he put the envelope inside his robes,opened it beneath the folds of cloth, and carefully snuck a peek at theparchment he drew forth.It said,Classroom to the left of Transfiguration, 8 in the morning.975 *Harry stared at it, trying to remember if he knew anyone with theinitials LL.His mind searched…Searched…Retrieved—“The Quibbler girl?” Harry whispered incredulously, and then shut hismouth. She was only ten years old, she shouldn’t be in Hogwarts at all!Aftermath: Lesath Lestrange.Harry was standing in the unused classroom next to Transfigurationat 8am, waiting, he’d at least managed to get some food into himself before facing the next disaster, Luna Lovegood…The door to the classroom opened, and Harry saw, and gave himselfa really hard mental kick.One more thing he hadn’t thought of, one more thing he really shouldhave.The older boy’s green-trimmed formal robes were askew, there werered spots on them looking very much like small dots of fresh blood, andone corner of his mouth had the look of a place that had been cut andhealed, by Episkey or some other minor medical Charm that didn’t quiteerase all the damage.Lesath Lestrange’s face was streaked with tears, fresh tears and halfdried tears, and there was water in his eyes, a promise of still more on theway. “Quietus,” said the older boy, and then “Homenum Revelio” and someother things, while Harry thought frantically and without much luck.And then Lesath lowered his wand and sheathed it in his robes, andslowly this time, formally, the older boy dropped to his knees on the dustyclassroom floor.Bowed his head all the way down, until his forehead also touched thedust, and Harry would have spoken but he was voiceless.976 *Lesath Lestrange said, in a breaking voice, “My life is yours, my Lord,and my death as well.”“I,” Harry said, there was a huge lump in his throat and he was havingtrouble speaking, “I—” didn’t have anything to do with it, he should havebeen saying, should be saying right now, but then again the innocentHarry would have had trouble speaking too—“Thank you,” whispered Lesath, “thank you, my Lord, oh, thank you,”the sound of a choked-off sob came from the kneeling boy, all Harry couldsee of him was the hair on the back of his head, nothing of his face. “I’ma fool, my Lord, an ungrateful bastard, unworthy to serve you, I cannotabase myself enough, for I—I shouted at you after you helped me, becauseI thought you were refusing me, and I didn’t even realize until this morning that I’d been such a fool as to ask you in front of Longbottom—”“I didn’t have anything to do with it,” Harry said.(It was still very hard to tell an outright lie like that.)Slowly Lesath raised his head from the floor, looked up at Harry.“I understand, my Lord,” said the older boy, his voice wavering a little,“you do not trust my cunning, and indeed I have shown myself a fool… Ionly wanted to say to you, that I am not ungrateful, that I know it musthave been hard enough to save only one person, that they’re alerted now,that you can’t—get Father—but I am not ungrateful, I will never be ungrateful to you again. If ever you have a use for this unworthy servant,call me wherever I am, and I will answer, my Lord—”“I was not involved in any way.”(But it got easier each time.)Lesath gazed up at Harry, said uncertainly, “Am I dismissed fromyour presence, my Lord…?”“I am not your Lord.”Lesath said, “Yes, my Lord, I understand,” and pushed himself backup from the floor, stood straight and bowed deeply, then backed awayfrom Harry until he turned to open the classroom door.As Lesath’s hand touched the doorknob, he paused.Harry couldn’t see Lesath’s face, as the older boy’s voice said, “Did yousend her to someone who would take care of her? Did she ask about meat all?”977 *And Harry said, his voice perfectly level, “Please stop that. I was notinvolved in any way.”“Yes, my Lord, I’m sorry, my Lord,” said Lesath’s voice; and theSlytherin boy opened the door and went out and shut the door behindhim. His feet sped up as he ran away, but not fast enough that Harrycouldn’t hear him start sobbing.Would I cry? wondered Harry. If I knew nothing, if I was innocent, wouldI cry right now?Harry didn’t know, so he just kept looking at the door.And some unbelievably tactless part of him thought, Yay, we completeda quest and got a minion—Shut up. If you ever want to vote on anything ever again… shut up.Aftermath, Amelia Bones:“Then his life isn’t in danger, I take it,” said Amelia.The healer, a stern-eyed old man who wore his robes white (he was aMuggleborn and honoring some strange tradition of Muggles, of whichAmelia had never asked, although privately she thought it made him looktoo much like a ghost), shook his head and said, “Definitely not.”Amelia looked at the human form resting unconscious on the healer’sbed, the burned and blasted flesh, the thin sheet that covered him formodesty’s sake having been peeled back at her command.He might make a full recovery.He might not.The healer had said it was too early to say.Then Amelia looked at the other witch in the room, the detective.“And you say,” Amelia said, “that the burning matter was Transfigured from water, presumably in the form of ice.”The detective nodded her head, and said, sounding puzzled, “It couldhave been much worse, if not for—”978 *“How very nice of them,” she spat, and then pressed a weary hand toher forehead. No… no, it had been intended as a kindness. By the finalstage of the escape there would be no point in trying to fool anyone. Whoever had done this, then, had been trying to mitigate the damage—andthey’d been thinking in terms of Aurors breathing the smoke, not of anyone being attacked with the fire. If it had been them still in control, nodoubt, they would have steered the rocker more mercifully.But Bellatrix Black had ridden the rocker out of Azkaban alone,all the watching Aurors had agreed on that, they’d had their AntiDisillusionment Charms active and there had been only one womanon that rocker, though the rocker had sported two sets of stirrups.Some good and innocent person, capable of casting the PatronusCharm, had been tricked into rescuing Bellatrix Black.Some innocent had fought Bahry One-Hand, carefully subduing anexperienced Auror without significantly injuring him.Some innocent had Transfigured the fuel for the Muggle artifact onwhich the two of them had been to ride out of Azkaban, making it fromfrozen water for the benefit of her Aurors.And then their usefulness to Bellatrix Black had ended.You would have expected anyone capable of subduing Bahry OneHand to have foreseen that part. But then you wouldn’t have expectedanyone who could cast the Patronus Charm to try rescuing BellatrixBlack in the first place.Amelia passed her hand down over her eyes, closing them for a moment in silent mourning. I wonder who it was, and how You-Know-Who manipulated them… what story they could possibly have been told…She didn’t even realize until a moment later that the thought meantshe was starting to believe. Perhaps because, no matter how difficult itwas to believe Dumbledore, it was becoming more difficult not to recognize the hand of that cold, dark intelligence.979 *Aftermath, Albus Dumbledore:It might have been only fifty-seven seconds before breakfast endedand he might have needed four twists of his Time-Turner, but in the end,Albus Dumbledore did make it.“Headmaster?” squeaked the polite voice of Professor Filius Flitwick,as the old wizard passed him by on his way to his seat. “Mr. Potter left amessage for you.”The old wizard stopped. He looked inquiringly at the Charms Professor.“Mr. Potter said that after he woke up, he realized how unfair hadbeen the things he said to you after Fawkes screamed. Mr. Potter saidthat he wasn’t saying anything about anything else, just apologizing forthat one part.”The old wizard kept looking at his Charms Professor, and still did notspeak.“Headmaster?” squeaked Filius.“Tell him I said thank you,” said Albus Dumbledore, “but that it iswiser to listen to phoenixes than to wise old wizards,” and sat down athis place three seconds before all the food vanished.Aftermath, Professor Quirrell:“No,” Madam Pomfrey snapped at the child, “you may not see him!You may not pester him! You may not ask him one little question! He is torest in bed and do nothing for at least three days!”Aftermath, Minerva McGonagall:She was heading toward the infirmary, and Harry Potter was leavingit, when they passed each other.The look he gave her wasn’t angry.It wasn’t sad.It didn’t say much at all.It was like… like he was looking at her just long enough to make it clearthat he wasn’t deliberately avoiding looking at her.And then he looked away before she could figure out what look to givehim in return; as though he wanted to spare her that, as well.He didn’t say anything as he walked past her.Neither did she.What could there possibly be to say?Aftermath, Fred and George Weasley:They actually yelped out loud, when they turned the corner and sawDumbledore.It wasn’t that the Headmaster had popped up out of nowhere and wasstaring at them with a stern expression. Dumbledore was always doingthat.But the wizard was dressed in formal black robes and looking veryancient and very powerful and he was giving the two of them a SHARP“Fred and George Weasley!” spake Dumbledore in a Voice of Power.“Yes, Headmaster!” they said, snapping upright and giving him acrisp military salute they’d seen in some old pictures.“Hear me well! You are the friends of Harry Potter, is this so?”“Yes, Headmaster!”“Harry Potter is in danger. He must not go beyond the wards of Hogwarts. Listen to me, sons of Weasley, I beg you listen: you know that I amas Gryffindor as yourselves, that I too know there are higher rules than981 *rules. But this, Fred and George, this one thing is of the most terrible importance, there must be no exception this time, small or great! If you helpHarry to leave Hogwarts he may die! Does he send you on a mission, youmay go, does he ask you to bring him items, you may help, but if he asksyou to smuggle his own person out of Hogwarts, you must refuse! Do youunderstand?”“Yes, Headmaster!” They said it without even thinking, really, andthen exchanged uncertain looks with each other—The bright blue eyes of the Headmaster were intent upon them. “No.Not without thinking. If Harry asks you to bring him out, you mustrefuse, if he asks you to tell him the way, you must refuse. I will not askyou to report him to me, for that I know you would never do. But beghim on my behalf to go to me, if it is of such importance, and I will guardhim as he walks. Fred, George, I am sorry to strain your friendship so,but it is his life.”The two of them looked at each other for a long while, not communicating, only thinking the same things at the same time.They looked back at Dumbledore.They said, with a chill running through them as they spoke the name,“Bellatrix Black.”“You may safely assume,” said the Headmaster, “that it is at least thatbad.”“Okay—”“—got it.”982 *Aftermath, Alastor Moody and Severus Snape:When Alastor Moody had lost his eye, he had commandeered the services of a most erudite Ravenclaw, Samuel H. Lyall, whom Moody mistrusted slightly less than average because Moody had refrained from reporting him as an unregistered werewolf; and he had paid Lyall to compile a list of every known magical eye, and every known hint to their location.When Moody had gotten the list back, he hadn’t bothered readingmost of it; because at the top of the list was the Eye of Vance, dating backto an era before Hogwarts, and currently in the possession of a powerful Dark Wizard ruling over some tiny forgotten hellhole that wasn’t inBritain or anywhere else he’d have to worry about silly rules.That was how Alastor Moody had lost his left foot and acquired theEye of Vance, and how the oppressed souls of Urulat had been liberatedfor a period of around two weeks before another Dark Wizard moved inon the power vacuum.He’d considered going after the Left Foot of Vance next, but had decided against it after he realized that would be just what they were expecting.Now Mad-Eye Moody was turning slowly, always turning, surveyingthe graveyard of Little Hangleton. It should have been a lot gloomier,that place, but in the broad daylight it seemed like nothing but a grassyplace marked by ordinary tombstones, demarcated by the chained twistsof fragile, easily climbable metal that Muggles used instead of wards.(Moody could not comprehend what the Muggles were thinking on thatscore, if they were pretending to have wards, or what, and he had decidednot to ask whether Muggle criminals respected the pretense.)Moody didn’t actually need to turn to survey the graveyard.The Eye of Vance saw the full globe of the world in every directionaround him, no matter where it was pointing.But there was no particular reason to let a former Death Eater likeSeverus Snape know that.Sometimes people called Moody ‘paranoid’.Moody always told them to survive a hundred years of hunting DarkWizards and then get back to him about that.983 *Mad-Eye Moody had once worked out how long it had taken him, inretrospect, to achieve what he now considered a decent level of caution—weighed up how much experience it had taken him to get good instead oflucky—and had begun to suspect that most people died before they gotthere. Moody had once expressed this thought to Lyall, who had donesome ciphering and figuring, and told him that a typical Dark Wizardhunter would die, on average, eight and a half times along the way to becoming ‘paranoid’. This explained a great deal, assuming Lyall wasn’t lying.Yesterday, Albus Dumbledore had told Mad-Eye Moody that the DarkLord had used unspeakable dark arts to survive the death of his body, andwas now awake and abroad, seeking to regain his power and begin theWizarding War anew.Someone else might have reacted with incredulity.“I can’t believe you lot never told me about this resurrection thing,”Mad-Eye Moody said with considerable acerbity. “D’you realize how longit’ll take me to do the grave of every ancestor of every Dark Wizard I’veever killed who could’ve been smart enough to make a horcrux? You’renot just now doing this one, are you?”“I redose this one every year,” Severus Snape said calmly, uncappingthe third flask of what the man had claimed would be seventeen bottles,and beginning to wave his wand over it. “The other ancestral graves we’vebeen able to locate were poisoned with only the long-lasting substances,since some of us have less free time than yourself.”Moody watched the fluid spiraling out of the vial and vanishing, toappear within the bones where marrow had once been. “But you thinkit’s worth the effort of the trap, instead of just Vanishing the bones.”“He does have other avenues to life, should he perceive this oneblocked,” Snape said dryly, uncapping a fourth bottle. “And before youask, it must be the original grave, the place of first burial, the bone removed during the ritual and not before. Thus he cannot have retrieved itearlier; and also there is no point in substituting the skeleton of a weakerancestor. He would notice it had lost all potency.”“Who else knows about this trap?” Moody demanded.“You. Me. The Headmaster. No one else.”984 *Moody snorted. “Pfah. Did Albus tell Amelia, Bartemius, and thatMcGonagall woman about the resurrection ritual?”“Yes—”“If Voldie finds out that Albus knows about the resurrection ritual andthat Albus told them, Voldie’ll figure that Albus told me, and Voldie knowsI’d think of this.” Moody shook his head in disgust. “What’re these otherways Voldie could come back to life?”Snape’s hand paused on the fifth bottle (it was all Disillusioned, ofcourse, the whole operation was Disillusioned, but that meant less thannothing to Moody, it just marked you in his Eye’s sight as trying-to-hide),and the former Death Eater said, “You don’t need to know.”“You’re learning, son,” said Moody with mild approval. “What’s in thebottles?”Snape opened the fifth bottle, gestured with his wand to begin thesubstance flowing toward the grave, and said, “This one? A Muggle narcotic called LSD. A conversation yesterday put me in mind of Mugglethings, and LSD seemed the most interesting option, so I hurried to obtain some. If it is incorporated into the resurrection potion, I suspect itseffects will be permanent.”“What does it do?” said Moody.“It is said that the effects are impossible to describe to anyone whohas not used it,” drawled Snape, “and I have not used it.”Moody nodded approval as Snape opened the sixth flask. “What aboutthat one?”“Love potion.”“Love potion?” said Moody.“Not of the standard sort. It is meant to trigger a two-way bond withan unbearably sweet Veela woman named Verdandi who the Headmasterhopes might be able to redeem even him, if they truly loved each other.”“Gah!” said Moody. “That bloody sentimental fool—”“Agreed,” Severus Snape said calmly, his attention focused on hiswork.“Tell me you’ve at least got some Malaclaw venom in there.”“Second flask.”“Iocane powder.”985 *“Either the fourteenth or fifteenth bottle.”“Bahl’s Stupefaction,” Moody said, naming an extremely addictivenarcotic with interesting side effects on people with Slytherin tendencies; Moody had once seen an addicted Dark Wizard go to ridiculouslengths to get a victim to lay hands on a certain exact portkey, instead ofjust having someone toss the target a trapped Knut on their next visit totown; and after going to all that work, the addict had gone to the furthereffort to lay a second Portus, on the same portkey, which had, on a secondtouch, transported the victim back to safety. To this day, even taking thedrug into account, Moody could not imagine what could have possiblybeen going through the man’s mind at the time he had cast the secondPortus.“Tenth vial,” said Snape.“Basilisk venom,” offered Moody.“What?” spat Snape. “Snake venom is a positive component of theresurrection potion! Not to mention that it would dissolve the bone andall the other substances! And where would we even get—”“Calm down, son, I was just checking to see if you could be trusted.”Mad-Eye Moody continued his (secretly unnecessary) slow turning,surveying the graveyard, and the Potions Master continued pouring.“Hold on,” Moody said suddenly. “How do you know this is reallywhere—”“Because it says ‘Tom Riddle’ on the easily moved headstone,” Snapesaid dryly. “And I have just won ten Sickles from the Headmaster, whobet you would think of that before the fifth bottle. So much for constantvigilance.”There was a pause.“How long did it take Albus to reali—”“Three years after we learned of the ritual,” said Snape, in a tone notquite like his usual sardonic drawl. “In retrospect, we should have consulted you earlier.”Snape uncapped the ninth bottle.“We poisoned all the other graves as well, with long-lasting substances,” remarked the former Death Eater. “It is possible that we arein the correct graveyard. He may not have planned this far ahead back986 *when he was slaughtering his family, and he cannot move the graveitself—”“The true location doesn’t look like a graveyard any more,” Moodysaid flatly. “He moved all the other graves here and Memory-Charmedthe Muggles. Not even Bellatrix Black would be told anything about thatuntil just before the ritual started. No one knows the true location nowexcept him.”They continued their futile work.Aftermath, Blaise Zabini:The Slytherin common room could be accurately and precisely described as a remilitarized zone; the moment you stepped through theportrait hole you would see that the left half of the room was DefinitelyNot Talking to the right half and vice versa. It was very clear, it did notneed to be explained to anyone, that you did not have the option of nottaking sides.At a table in the exact middle of the room, Blaise Zabini sat by himself,smirking as he did his homework. He had a reputation now, and meantto keep it.Aftermath, Daphne Greengrass and Tracey Davis:“You doing anything interesting today?” said Tracey.“Nope,” said Daphne.987 *Aftermath, Harry Potter:If you went high enough in Hogwarts, you didn’t see many otherpeople around, just corridors and windows and staircases and the occasional portrait, and now and then some interesting sight, such as abronze statue of a furry creature like a small child, holding a peculiar flatspear…If you went high enough in Hogwarts, you didn’t see many other people around, which suited Harry.There were much worse places to be trapped, Harry supposed. Infact you probably couldn’t think of anywhere better to be trapped thanan ancient castle with a fractal ever-changing structure that meant youcouldn’t ever run out of places to explore, full of interesting people andinteresting books and incredibly important knowledge unknown to Muggle science.If Harry hadn’t been told that he couldn’t leave, he probably would’vejumped at the chance to spend more time in Hogwarts, he would’ve plotted and connived to get it. Hogwarts was literally optimal, not in all therealms of possibility maybe, but certainly on the real planet Earth, it wasthe Maximum Fun Location.How could the castle and its grounds seem so much smaller, so muchmore confining, how could the rest of the world become so much moreinteresting and important, the instant Harry had been told that he wasn’tallowed to leave? He’d spent months here and hadn’t felt claustrophobicthen.You know the research on this, observed some part of himself, it’s juststandard scarcity effects, like that time where as soon as a county outlawed phosphate detergents, people who’d never cared before drove to the next county in order to buy huge loads of phosphate detergent, and surveys showed that they ratedphosphate detergents as gentler and more effective and even easier-pouring… andif you give two-year-olds a choice between a toy in the open and one protected bya barrier they can go around, they’ll ignore the toy in the open and go for the onebehind the barrier… salespeople know that they can sell things just by telling thecustomer it might not be available… it was all in Cialdini’s book Influence, ev* 988 *erything you’re feeling right now, the grass is always greener on the side that’s notallowed.If Harry hadn’t been told that he couldn’t leave, he probably would’vejumped at the chance to stay at Hogwarts over the summer……but not the rest of his life.That was sort of the problem, really.Who knew whether there was still a Dark Lord Voldemort for him todefeat?Who knew whether He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named still existed outside of the imagination of a possibly-not-just-pretending-to-be-crazy oldwizard?Lord Voldemort’s body had been found burned to a crisp, therecouldn’t really be such things as souls. How could Lord Voldemort stillbe alive? How did Dumbledore know that he was alive?And if there wasn’t a Dark Lord, Harry couldn’t defeat him, and hewould be trapped in Hogwarts forever.…maybe he would be legally allowed to escape after he graduated hisseventh year, six years and four months and three weeks from now. Itwasn’t that long as lengths of time went, it only seemed like long enoughfor protons to decay.Only it wasn’t just that.It wasn’t just Harry’s freedom that was at stake.The Headmaster of Hogwarts, the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot,the Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards,was quietly sounding the alarm.A false alarm.A false alarm which Harry had triggered.You know, said the part of him that refined his skills, didn’t you sort ofponder, once, how every different profession has a different way to be excellent,how an excellent teacher isn’t like an excellent plumber; but they all have in common certain methods of not being stupid; and that one of the most important suchtechniques is to face up to your little mistakes before they turn into BIG mistakes?…although this already seemed to qualify as a BIG mistake, actually…The point being, said his inner monitor, it’s getting worse literally by theminute. The way spies turn people is, they get them to commit a little sin, and thenthey use the little sin to blackmail them into a bigger sin, and then they use THATsin to make them do even bigger things and then the blackmailer owns their soul.Didn’t you once think about how the person being blackmailed, if they couldforesee the whole path, would just decide to take the punch on the first step, take thehit of exposing that first sin? Didn’t you decide that you would do that, if anyoneever tried to blackmail you into doing something major in order to conceal something little? Do you see the similarity here, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres?Only it wasn’t little, it already wasn’t little, there would be a lot of verypowerful people extremely angry at Harry, not just for the false alarm butfor freeing Bellatrix from Azkaban, if the Dark Lord did exist and did comeafter him later, that war might already be lost—You don’t think they’ll be impressed by your honesty and rationality and foresight in stopping this before it snowballs even further?Harry did not, in fact, think this; and after a moment’s reflection,whichever part of himself he was talking to, had to agree that this wasabsurdly optimistic.His wandering feet took him near an open window, and Harry wentover, and leaned his arms on the ledge, and stared down at the groundsof Hogwarts from high above.Brown that was barren trees, yellow that was dead grass, ice-coloredice that was frozen creeks and frozen streams… whichever school officialhad dubbed it ‘The Forbidden Forest’ really hadn’t understood marketing,the name just made you want to go there even more. The sun was sinkingin the sky, for Harry had been thinking for some hours now, thinkingmostly the same thoughts over and over, but with key differences eachtime, like his thoughts were not going in circles, but climbing a spiral, ordescending it.He still couldn’t believe that he’d gone through the entire thing withAzkaban—he’d switched off his Patronus before it took all his life, he’dstunned an Auror, he’d figured out how to hide Bella from the Dementors,he’d faced down twelve Dementors and scared them away, he’d inventedthe rocket-assisted broomstick, and ridden it—he’d gone through the entire thing without ever once rallying himself by thinking, I have to do this…because… I promised Hermione I’d come back from lunch! It felt like an irrevocably missed opportunity; like, having done it wrong that time, he wouldnever be able to get it right no matter what sort of challenge he faced nexttime, or what promise he made. Because then he would just be doingit awkwardly and deliberately to make up for having missed it the firsttime around, instead of making the heroic declarations he could’ve madeif he’d remembered his promise to Hermione. Like that one wrong turnwas irrevocable, you only got one chance, had to do it right on the firsttry…He should’ve remembered that promise to Hermione before going toAzkaban.Why had he decided to do that, again?My working hypothesis is that you’re stupid, said Hufflepuff.That is not a useful fault analysis, thought Harry.If you want a little more detail, said Hufflepuff, the Defense Professor ofHogwarts was all like ‘Let’s get Bellatrix Black out of Azkaban!’ and you were like‘Okay!’Hold on, THAT’S not fair—Hey, said Hufflepuff, notice how, once you’re all the way up here, and theindividual trees sort of blur together, you can actually see the shape of the forest?Why had he done it…?Not because of any cost-benefit calculation, that was for sure. He’dbeen too embarrassed to pull out a sheet of paper and start calculating expected utilities, he’d worried that Professor Quirrell would stop respecting him if he said no or even hesitated too much to help a maiden in distress.He’d thought, somewhere deep inside him, that if your mysteriousteacher offered you the first mission, the first chance, the call to adventure, and you said no, then your mysterious teacher walked away fromyou in disgust, and you never got another chance to be a hero……yeah, that had been it. In retrospect, that had been it. He’d gone andstarted thinking his life had a plot and here was a plot twist, as opposedto, oh, say, here was a proposal to break Bellatrix Black out of Azkaban. Thathad been the true and original reason for the decision in the split second where it had been made, his brain perceptually recognizing the narrative where he said ‘no’ as dissonant. And when you thought about it,that wasn’t a rational way to make decisions. Professor Quirrell’s ulterior991 *motive to obtain the last remains of Slytherin’s lost lore, before Bellatrixdied and it was irrevocably forgotten, seemed impressively sane by comparison; a benefit commensurate with what had appeared at the time asa small risk.It didn’t seem fair, it didn’t seem fair, that this was what happened ifhe lost his grip on his rationality for just a tiny fraction of a second, thetiny fraction of a second required for his brain to decide to be more comfortable with ‘yes’ arguments than ‘no’ arguments during the discussionthat had followed.From high above, far enough above that the individual trees blurredtogether, Harry stared out at the forest.Harry didn’t want to confess and ruin his reputation forever and geteveryone angry at him and maybe end up killed by the Dark Lord later.He’d rather be trapped in Hogwarts for six years than face that. That washow he felt. And so it was in fact helpful, a relief, to be able to cling to a single decisive factor, which was that if Harry confessed, Professor Quirrellwould go to Azkaban and die there.(A catch, a break, a stutter in Harry’s breathing.)If you phrased it that way… why, you could even pretend to be a hero,instead of a coward.Harry lifted his eyes from the Forbidden Forest, looked up at the clearblue forbidden sky.Stared out the glass panes at the big bright burning thing, the fluffythings, the mysterious endless blue in which they were embedded, thatstrange new unknown place.It… actually did help, it helped quite a lot, to think that his own troubles were nothing compared to being in Azkaban. That there were peoplein the world who were really in trouble and Harry Potter was not one ofthem.What was he going to do about Azkaban?What was he going to do about magical Britain?…which side was he on, now?In the bright light of day, everything that Albus Dumbledore had saidcertainly sounded a lot wiser than Professor Quirrell. Better and brighter,more moral, more convenient, wouldn’t it be nice if it were true. And the992 *thing to remember was that Dumbledore believed things because theysounded nice, but Professor Quirrell was the one who was sane.(Again the catch in his breathing, it happened each time he thoughtof Professor Quirrell.)But just because something sounded nice, didn’t make it wrong, either.And if the Defense Professor did have a flaw in his sanity, it was thathis outlook on life was too negative.Really? inquired the part of Harry that had read eighteen million experimental results about people being too optimistic and overconfident.Professor Quirrell is too pessimistic? So pessimistic that his expectations routinelyundershoot reality? Stuff him and put him in a museum, he’s unique. Whichone of you two planned the perfect crime, and then put in all the error marginand fallbacks that ended up saving your butt, just in case the perfect crime wentwrong? Hint hint, his name wasn’t Harry Potter.But “pessimistic” wasn’t the correct word to describe Professor Quirrell’s problem—if a problem it truly was, and not the superior wisdom ofexperience. But to Harry it looked like Professor Quirrell was constantlyinterpreting everything in the worst possible light. If you handed Professor Quirrell a glass that was 90% full, he’d tell you that the 10% empty partproved that no one really cared about water.That was a very good analogy, now that Harry thought about it. Notall of magical Britain was like Azkaban, that glass was well over half full…Harry stared up at the bright blue sky.…although, following the analogy, if Azkaban existed, then maybe itdid prove that the 90% good part was there for other reasons, people trying to make a show of kindness as Professor Quirrell had put it. For if theywere truly kind they would not have made Azkaban, they would storm thefortress to tear it down… wouldn’t they?Harry stared up at the bright blue sky. If you wanted to be a rationalist you had to read an awful lot of papers on flaws in human nature,and some of those flaws were innocent logical failures, and some of themlooked a lot darker.Harry stared up at the bright blue sky, and thought of the Milgramexperiment.993 *Stanley Milgram had done it to investigate the causes of World WarII, to try to understand why the citizens of Germany had obeyed Hitler.So he had designed an experiment to investigate obedience, to see ifGermans were, for some reason, more liable to obey harmful orders fromauthority figures.First he’d run a pilot version of his experiment on American subjects,as a control.And afterward he hadn’t bothered trying it in Germany.Experimental apparatus: A series of 30 switches set in a horizontalline, with labels starting at ‘15 volts’ and going up to ‘450 volts’, with labelsfor each group of four switches. The first group of four labeled ‘SlightShock’, the sixth group labeled ‘Extreme Intensity Shock’, the seventhgroup labeled ‘Danger: Severe Shock’, and the two last switches left overlabeled just ‘XXX’.And an actor, a confederate of the experimenter, who had appearedto the true subjects to be someone just like them: someone who had answered the same ad for participants in an experiment on learning, andwho had lost a (rigged) lottery and been strapped into a chair, along withthe electrodes. The true experimental subjects had been given a slightshock from the electrodes, just so that they could see that it worked.The true subject had been told that the experiment was on the effectsof punishment on learning and memory, and that part of the test was tosee if it made a difference what sort of person administered the punishment; and that the person strapped to the chair would try to memorizesets of word pairs, and that each time the ‘learner’ got one wrong, the‘teacher’ was to administer a successively stronger shock.At the 300-volt level, the actor would stop trying to call out answersand begin kicking at the wall, after which the experimenter would instruct the subjects to treat non-answers as wrong answers and continue.At the 315-volt level the pounding on the wall would be repeated.After that nothing would be heard.If the subject objected or refused to press a switch, the experimenter,maintaining an impassive demeanor and dressed in a gray lab coat,would say ‘Please continue’, then ‘The experiment requires that you continue’, then ‘It is absolutely essential that you continue’, then ‘You have994 *no other choice, you must go on’. If the fourth prod still didn’t work, theexperiment halted there.Before running the experiment, Milgram had described the experimental setup, and then asked fourteen psychology seniors whatpercentage of subjects they thought would go all the way up to the 450volt level, what percentage of subjects would press the last of the twoswitches marked XXX, after the victim had stopped responding.The most pessimistic answer had been 3%.The actual number had been 26 out of 40.The subjects had sweated, groaned, stuttered, laughed nervously,bitten their lips, dug their fingernails into their flesh. But at the experimenter’s prompting, they had, most of them, gone on administeringwhat they believed to be painful, dangerous, possibly lethal electricalshocks. All the way to the end.Harry could hear Professor Quirrell laughing, in his mind; the Defense Professor’s voice saying something along the lines of: Why, Mr. Potter, even I had not been so cynical; I knew men would betray their most cherishedprinciples for money and power, but I did not realize that a stern look also sufficed.It was dangerous, to try and guess at evolutionary psychology if youweren’t a professional evolutionary psychologist; but when Harry hadread about the Milgram experiment, the thought had occurred to himthat situations like this had probably arisen many times in the ancestralenvironment, and that most potential ancestors who’d tried to disobeyAuthority were dead. Or that they had, at least, done less well for themselves than the obedient. People thought themselves good and moral,but when push came to shove, some switch flipped in their brain, and itwas suddenly a lot harder to heroically defy Authority than they thought.Even if you could do it, it wouldn’t be easy, it wouldn’t be some effortlessdisplay of heroism. You would tremble, your voice would break, youwould be afraid; would you be able to defy Authority even then?Harry blinked, then; because his brain had just made the connectionbetween Milgram’s experiment and what Hermione had done on her firstday of Defense class, she’d refused to shoot a fellow student, even whenAuthority had told her that she must, she had trembled and been afraid995 *but she had still refused. Harry had seen that happen right in front of hisown eyes and he still hadn’t made the connection until now…Harry stared down at the reddening horizon, the Sun was sinkinglower, the sky fading, darkening, even if most of it was still blue, soon itwould turn to night. The gold and red colors of Sun and sunset remindedhim of Fawkes; and Harry wondered, for a moment, if it must be a sadthing to be a phoenix, and call and cry and scream without being heeded.But Fawkes would never give up, as many times as he died he wouldalways be reborn, for Fawkes was a being of light and fire, and despairingover Azkaban belonged to the darkness just as much as did Azkaban itself.If you were given a glass half-empty and half-full, then that was theway reality was, that was the truth and it was so; but you still had a choiceof how to feel about it, whether you would despair over the empty half orrejoice in the water that was there.Milgram had tried certain other variations on his test.In the eighteenth experiment, the experimental subject had onlyneeded to call out the test words to the victim strapped into the chair,and record the answers, while someone else pressed the switches. It wasthe same apparent suffering, the same frantic pounding followed bysilence; but it wasn’t you pressing the switch. You just watched it happen,and read the questions to the person being tortured.37 of 40 subjects had continued their participation in that experimentto the end, the 450-volt end marked ‘XXX’.And if you were Professor Quirrell, you might have decided to feel cynical about that.But 3 out of 40 subjects had refused to participate all the way to the end.The Hermiones.They did exist, in the world, the people who wouldn’t fire a SimpleStrike Hex at a fellow student even if the Defense Professor ordered themto do it. The ones who had sheltered Gypsies and Jews and homosexualsin their attics during the Holocaust, and sometimes lost their lives for it.And were those people from some other species than humanity? Didthey have some extra gear in their heads, some additional chunk of neural circuitry, which lesser mortals did not possess? But that was not likely,given the logic of sexual reproduction which said that the genes for com*996 *plex machinery would be scrambled beyond repair, if they were not universal.Whatever parts Hermione was made from, everyone had those sameparts inside them somewhere……well, that was a nice thought but it wasn’t strictly true, there wassuch a thing as literal brain damage, people could lose genes and thecomplex machine could stop working, there were sociopaths and psychopaths, people who lacked the gear to care. Maybe Lord Voldemorthad been born like that, or maybe he had known good and yet still chosenevil; at this point it didn’t matter in the slightest. But a supermajority ofthe population ought to be capable of learning to do what Hermione andHolocaust resisters did.The people who had been run through the Milgram experiment, whohad trembled and sweated and nervously laughed as they went all theway to pressing the switches marked ‘XXX’, many of them had written tothank Milgram, afterward, for what they had learned about themselves.That, too, was part of the story, the legend of that legendary experiment.The Sun had almost sunk below the horizon now, a last golden tippeeking above the faraway tops of trees.Harry looked at it, that tip of Sun, his glasses were supposed to beproof against UV so he ought to be able to look directly at it without damaging his eyes.Harry stared directly at it, that tiny fraction of the Light that was notobscured and blocked and hidden, even if it was only 3 parts out of 40, theother 37 parts were there somewhere. The 7.5% of the glass that was full,which proved that people really did care about water, even if that forceof caring within themselves was too often defeated. If people truly didn’tcare, the glass would have been truly empty. If everyone had been likeYou-Know-Who inside, secretly cleverly selfish, there would have beenno resisters to the Holocaust at all.Harry looked at the sunset, on the second day of the rest of his life,and knew that he had switched sides.Because he couldn’t believe in it any more, he couldn’t really, not after going to Azkaban. He couldn’t do what 37 out of 40 people would votefor him to do. Everyone might have inside them what it took to be Her*997 *mione, and someday they might learn; but someday wasn’t now, not here,not today, not in the real world. If you were on the side of 3 out of 40 people then you weren’t a political majority, and Professor Quirrell had beenright, Harry would not bow his head in submission when that happened.There was a sort of awful appropriateness to it. You shouldn’t go toAzkaban and come back having not changed your mind about anythingimportant.So is Professor Quirrell right, then? asked Slytherin. Leaving out whetherhe’s good or evil, is he right? Are you, to them, whether they know it or not, theirnext Lord? We’ll just leave out the Dark part, that’s him being cynical again. Butis it your intention now to rule? I’ve got to say, that makes even me nervous.Do you think you can be trusted with power? said Gryffindor. Isn’t theresome sort of rule that people who want power shouldn’t have it? Maybe we shouldmake Hermione the ruler instead.Do you think you’re fit to run a society and not have it collapse into total chaosinside of three weeks flat? said Hufflepuff. Imagine how loudly Mum wouldscream if she’d heard you’d been elected Prime Minister, now ask yourself, are yousure she’s wrong about that?Actually, said Ravenclaw, I have to point out that all this political stuffsounds overwhelmingly boring. How about if we leave all the electioneering toDraco and stick to science? It’s what we’re actually good at, and that’s been knownto improve the human condition too, y’know.Slow down, thought Harry at his components, we don’t have to decideeverything right now. We’re allowed to ponder the problem as fully as possiblebefore coming to a solution.The last part of the Sun sank below the horizon.It was strange, this feeling of not quite knowing who you were, whichside you were on, of having not already made up your mind about somethingas major as that, there was an unfamiliar sensation of freedom in it…And that reminded him of what Professor Quirrell had said to his lastquestion, which reminded him of Professor Quirrell, which made it hardonce more to breathe, started that burning sensation in Harry’s throat,sent his thoughts around that loop of the climbing spiral once again.Why was he so sad, now, whenever he thought of Professor Quirrell?Harry was used to knowing himself, and he didn’t know why he felt sosad…It felt like he’d lost Professor Quirrell forever, lost him in Azkaban,that was how it felt. As surely as if the Defense Professor had been eatenby Dementors, consumed in the empty voids.Lost him! Why did I lose him? Because he said Avada Kedavra and there wasin fact a perfectly good reason even though I didn’t see it for a couple of hours? Whycan’t things go back to the way they were?But then it hadn’t been the Avada Kedavra. That might have played apart in irreversibly collapsing a structure of rationalizations and flinchesand carefully not thinking about certain things. But it hadn’t been theAvada Kedavra, that hadn’t been the disturbing thing that Harry hadseen.What did I see…?Harry looked at the fading sky.He’d seen Professor Quirrell turn into a hardened criminal while facing the Auror, and the apparent change of personalities had been effortless, and complete.Another woman had known the Defense Professor as ‘Jeremy Jaffe’.How many different people are you, anyway?I cannot say that I bothered keeping count.You couldn’t help but wonder……whether ‘Professor Quirrell’ was just one more name on the list, justone more person that had been turned into, made up in the service of someunguessable goal.Harry would always be wondering now, every time he talked to Professor Quirrell, if it was a mask, and what motive was behind that mask.With every dry smile, Harry would be trying to see what was pulling thelevers on the lips.Is that how other people will start thinking of me, if I get too Slytherin? If Ipull off too many plots, will I never be able to smile at anyone again, without themwondering what I really mean by it?Maybe there was some way to restore a trust in surface appearances and make a normal human relationship possible again, but Harrycouldn’t think of what it might be.That was how Harry had lost Professor Quirrell, not the person, butthe… connection…Why did that hurt so much?Why did it feel so lonely, now?Surely there were other people, maybe better people, to trust and befriend? Professor McGonagall, Professor Flitwick, Hermione, Draco, notto mention Mum and Dad, it wasn’t like Harry was alone…Only…A choking sensation grew in Harry’s throat as he understood.Only Professor McGonagall, Professor Flitwick, Hermione, Draco,they all of them sometimes knew things that Harry didn’t, but…They did not excel above Harry within his own sphere of power; suchgenius as they possessed was not like his genius, and his genius was notlike theirs; he might look upon them as peers, but not look up to them ashis superiors.None of them had been, none of them could ever be…Harry’s mentor…That was who Professor Quirrell had been.That was who Harry had lost.And the manner in which he had lost his first mentor might or mightnot allow Harry to ever get him back. Maybe someday he would knowall Professor Quirrell’s hidden purposes and the doubts between themwould go away; but even if that seemed possible, it didn’t seem very probable.There was a gust of wind, outside Hogwarts, it bent the empty trees,rippled the lake whose heart was still unfrozen, made a whisperingsound as it slid past the window that looked upon the half-twilit world,and Harry’s thoughts wandered outward for a time.Then returned inward again, to the next step of the spiral.Why am I different from the other children my age?If Professor Quirrell’s answer to that had been an evasion, then itwas a very well-calculated one. Deep enough and complex enough, sufficiently full of suggestions of hidden meaning, to serve as a trap for aRavenclaw who couldn’t be diverted by less. Or maybe Professor Quirrellhad meant his answer honestly. Who knew what motive might havepulled that lever on those lips?I will say this much, Mr. Potter: You are already an Occlumens, and I thinkyou will become a perfect Occlumens before long. Identity does not mean, to suchas us, what it means to other people. Anyone we can imagine, we can be; and thetrue difference about you, Mr. Potter, is that you have an unusually good imagination. A playwright must contain his characters, he must be larger than them inorder to enact them within his mind. To an actor or spy or politician, the limit ofhis own diameter is the limit of who he can pretend to be, the limit of which face hemay wear as a mask. But for such as you and I, anyone we can imagine, we canbe, in reality and not pretense. While you imagined yourself a child, Mr. Potter,you were a child. Yet there are other existences you could support, larger existences, if you wished. Why are you so free, and so great in your circumference,when other children your age are small and constrained? Why can you imagineand become selves more adult than a mere child of a playwright should be ableto compose? That I do not know, and I must not say what I guess. But what youhave, Mr. Potter, is freedom.If that was a snow job it was one heck of a distracting one.And the still more worrisome thought was that Professor Quirrellhadn’t realized how disturbed Harry would be, how wrong that speechwould sound to him, how much damage it would do to his trust inProfessor Quirrell.There ought to always be one real person who you truly were, at thecenter of everything…Harry stared out at the falling night, the gathering darkness.…right?It was almost bedtime when Hermione heard the scattered intakes ofbreath and looked up from her copy of Beauxbatons: A History to seethe missing boy, the boy who had been misplaced at lunch that Sunday,whose dinner nonappearance had been accompanied by rumors—andshe hadn’t believed them because they were completely ridiculous, but she’dfelt a little queasiness inside—that he’d withdrawn from Hogwarts inorder to hunt down Bellatrix Black.“Harry!” she shrieked, she didn’t even realize that she was talking directly to him for the first time in a week, or notice how some other students started at the sound of her yelling all the way across the Ravenclawcommon room.Harry’s eyes had already lifted to her, he was already walking towardher, so she stopped halfway out of her chair—A few moments later, Harry was seated across from her, and he wasputting away his wand after casting a Quieting barrier around them.(And an awful lot of Ravenclaws were trying not to look like they werewatching.)“Hey,” Harry said. His voice wavered. “I missed you. You’re… goingto talk to me again, now?”Hermione nodded, she just nodded, she couldn’t think of what to say.She’d missed Harry too, but she was realizing, with a guilty sort of feeling,that it might’ve been a lot worse for him. She had other friends, Harry… itdidn’t feel fair, sometimes, that Harry talked to only her like that, so thatshe had to talk to him; but Harry had a look about him like unfair thingshad been happening to him, too.“What’s been going on?” she said. “There’s all sorts of rumors. Therewere people saying you’d run off to fight Bellatrix Black, there were people saying you’d run off to join Bellatrix Black—” and those rumors hadsaid that Hermione had just made up the thing about the phoenix, andshe’d yelled that the whole Ravenclaw common room had seen it, so thenthe next rumor had claimed she’d made up that part too, which was stupidity of such an inconceivable level that it left her completely flabbergasted.“I can’t talk about it,” Harry said in a bare whisper. “Can’t talk abouta lot of it. I wish I could tell you everything,” his voice wavered, “but Ican’t… I guess, if it helps or anything, I’m not going to lunch with Professor Quirrell any more…”Harry put his hands over his face, then, covering his eyes.Hermione felt the queasy feeling all through her stomach.“Are you crying?” said Hermione.“Yeah,” said Harry, his voice sounding a little breathy. “I don’t wantanyone else to see.”There was a little silence. Hermione wanted to help but she didn’tknow what to do about a boy crying, and she didn’t know what was happening; she felt like huge things were happening around her—no, aroundHarry—and if she knew what they were she would probably be scared, oralarmed, or something, but she didn’t know anything.“Did Professor Quirrell do something wrong?” she said at last.“That’s not why I can’t go to lunch with him any more,” Harry said,still in that bare whisper with his hands pressed over his eyes. “That wasthe Headmaster’s decision. But yeah, Professor Quirrell said some thingsto me that made me trust him less, I guess…” Harry’s voice sounded veryshaky. “I’m feeling kind of alone right now.”Hermione put her hand on her cheek where Fawkes had touched heryesterday. She’d kept thinking about that touch, over and over, maybebecause she wanted it to be important, to mean something to her…“Is there any way I can help?” she said.“I want to do something normal,” Harry said from behind his hands.“Something very normal for first-year Hogwarts students. Somethingeleven-year-olds and twelve-year-olds like us are supposed to do. Like playa game of Exploding Snap or something… I don’t suppose you have thecards or know the rules or anything like that?”“Um… I don’t know the rules, actually…” said Hermione. “I know theyexplode.”“I don’t suppose Gobstones?” said Harry.“Don’t know the rules and they spit at you. Those are boy games,Harry!”There was a pause. Harry ground his hands against his face to wipeit, and then took his hands away; and then he was looking at her, looking a little helpless. “Well,” Harry said, “what do wizards and witches ourage do, when they play, you know, the kind of pointless silly games we’resupposed to play at this age?”“Hopscotch?” said Hermione. “Jump-rope? Unicorn attack? I don’tknow, I read books!”Harry started laughing, and Hermione started giggling along withhim even though she didn’t know quite why, but it was funny.“I guess that helped a little,” said Harry. “Actually I think it helpedmore than playing Gobstones for an hour could’ve possibly helped, sothanks for being you. And no matter what, I’m not having anyone Obliviate everything I know about calculus. I’d sooner die.”“What?” said Hermione. “Why—why would you ever want to do that?”Harry stood up from the table, and there was a rush of restored background noise as his rise broke the Quieting Charm. “I’m a tad sleepy soI’m going off to bed,” Harry said, now his voice was ordinary and wry,“I’ve got some lost time to make up for, but I’ll see you at breakfast, andthen at Herbology, if that’s all right. Not to mention it wouldn’t be fair todump all my depression on you. G’night, Hermione.”“Good night, Harry,” she said, feeling very confused and alarmed.“Pleasant dreams.”Harry stumbled a little as she said that, and then he continued on toward the stairs that led to the first-year-boys’ dorms.Harry turned the Quieting Charm all the way up, on the head of his bedboard, so that he wouldn’t wake anyone else up if he screamed.Set his alarm to wake him up for breakfast (if he wasn’t up already bythat hour, if indeed he slept at all).Got into bed, laid down——felt the lump beneath his pillow.Harry stared up at the canopy above his bed.Hissed under his breath, “Oh, you’ve got to be kidding me…”It took a few seconds before Harry could muster the heart to sit upin bed, pull the blanket over himself and his pillow to obscure the deedfrom the other boys, cast a low-intensity Lumos and see what was underhis pillow.There was a parchment, and a deck of playing cards.The parchment read,A little bird told me that Dumbledore has shut the door of your cage.I must admit, on this occasion, that Dumbledore may have a point.Bellatrix Black is loosed upon the world once more, and that is not goodnews for any good person. If I stood in Dumbledore’s place, I might welldo the same.But just in case… The Salem Witches’ Institute in America acceptsboys as well, despite the name. They are good people and would protectyou even from Dumbledore, if you needed it. Britain holds that you needDumbledore’s permission to emigrate to magical America, but magicalAmerica disagrees. So in the final extremity, get outside the wards of Hogwarts and tear in half the King of Hearts from this deck of cards.That you should resort to it only in the final extremity goes withoutsaying.Be well, Harry Potter.—Santa ClausHarry stared down at the pack of cards.It couldn’t take him anywhere else, not right now, portkeys didn’t workhere.But he still felt unnerved about the prospect of picking it up, even tohide it inside his trunk…Well, he’d already picked up the parchment, which could just as easilyhave been enchanted with a trap, if a trap was involved.But still.“Wingardium Leviosa,” Harry whispered, and Hovered the packet ofcards to lie next to where his alarm clock rested in a pocket of the headboard. He’d deal with it tomorrow.And then Harry lay back in bed, and closed his eyes, to dream withoutany phoenix to protect him, and pay his reckoning.He came awake with a gasp of horror, not a scream, he’d yet to scream thisnight, but his blanket was all tangled around him from where his sleepingform had jerked as he dreamed of running, trying to get away from thegaps in space that were pursuing him through a corridor of metal lit bydim gaslight, an endlessly long corridor of metal lit by dim gaslight, andhe hadn’t known, in the dream, that touching those voids meant he woulddie horribly and leave his still-breathing body empty behind him, all he’dknown was that he had to run and run and run from the wounds in theworld sliding after him—Harry started to cry again, it wasn’t for the horror of the chase, it wasthat he’d run away while someone behind him was screaming for help,screaming for him to come back and save her, help her, she was beingeaten, she was going to die, and in the dream Harry had run away insteadof helping her.“DON’T GO!” The voice came in a scream from behind the metal door.“No, no, no, don’t go, don’t take it away, don’t don’t don’t—”Why had Fawkes ever rested on his shoulder? He’d walked away.Fawkes should hate him.Fawkes should hate Dumbledore. He’d walked away.Fawkes should hate everyone—The boy wasn’t awake, wasn’t dreaming, his thoughts were jumbledand confused in the shadowlands that bordered sleep and waking, unprotected by the safety rails that his aware mind imposed on itself, the careful rules and censors. In that shadowland his brain had woken up enoughto think, but something else was too sleepy to act; his thoughts ran freeand wild, unconstrained by his self-concept, his waking self’s ideals ofwhat he shouldn’t think. That was the freedom of his brain’s dreams, ashis self-concept slept. Free to repeat, over and over, Harry’s new worstnightmare:“No, I didn’t mean it, please don’t die!”“No, I didn’t mean it, please don’t die!”“No, I didn’t mean it, please don’t die!”A rage grew in him alongside the self-loathing, a terrible hot wrath /icy cold hatred, for the world which had done that to her / for himself, andin his half-awake state Harry fantasized escapes, fantasized ways out ofthe moral dilemma, he imagined himself hovering above the vast triangular horror of Azkaban, and whispering an incantation unlike any syllablesthat had ever been heard before on Earth, whispers that echoed all the wayacross the sky and were heard on the other side of the world, and therewas a blast of silver Patronus fire like a nuclear explosion that tore apartall the Dementors in an instant and ripped apart the metal walls of Azkaban, shattered the long corridors and all the dim orange lights, and then amoment later his brain remembered that there were people in there, andrewrote the half-dream fantasy to show all the prisoners laughing as theyflew away in flocks from the burning wreck of Azkaban, the silver lightrestoring the flesh to their limbs as they flew, and Harry started cryingharder into his pillow, because he couldn’t do it, because he wasn’t God—He’d sworn upon his life and magic and his art as a rationalist, he’dsworn by all he held sacred and all his happy memories, he’d given hisoath so now he had to do something, had to do something, had to DOMaybe it was pointless.Maybe trying to follow rules was pointless.Maybe you just burned down Azkaban however.And in fact he’d sworn he’d do it, so now that was what he had to do.He’d just do whatever it took to get rid of Azkaban, that was all. Ifthat meant ruling Britain, fine, if that meant finding a spell to whisperthat would echo all across the sky, whatever, the important thing was todestroy Azkaban.That was the side he was on, that was who he was, so there, it wasdone.His waking mind would have demanded a lot more details beforeaccepting that as an answer, but in his half-dreaming state it felt likeenough of a resolution to let his tired mind fall truly asleep again, anddream the next nightmare.Final Aftermath:She came awake with a gasp of horror, a disruption of her breathingthat left her feeling deprived of air and yet her lungs didn’t move, shewoke up with an unvoiced scream on her lips and no words, no wordscame forth, for she could not understand what she had seen, she could notunderstand what she had seen, it was too large for her to encompass and stilltaking shape, she could not put words to that formless shape and so shecould not discharge it, could not discharge it and become innocent andunknowing once more.“What time is it?” she whispered.Her golden jeweled alarm clock, the beautiful and magical and expensive alarm clock that the Headmaster had given her as a gift upon heremployment at Hogwarts, whispered back, “Around two in the morning.Go back to sleep.”Her sheets were soaked in sweat, her nightclothes soaked in sweat,she took her wand from beside the pillow and cleaned herself up beforeshe tried to go back to sleep, she tried to go back to sleep and eventuallysucceeded.Sybill Trelawney went back to sleep.ermione Granger had read somewhere once, that one of the keys tostaying thin was to pay attention to the food you ate, to notice yourself eating it, so that you were satisfied with the meal. This morning she’dmade herself toast, and put butter on the toast, and cinnamon on the butter, and it really should’ve been enough to get her to notice, this time, thegoodness that was in front of her…Without noticing the cinnamon or the butter, without noticing thefood or that she was eating, Hermione swallowed another bite of toast,and said, “Can you try explaining that again? I’m still completely flabbergasted.”“It’s pretty straightforward, if you think like a Light-Side Slytherin,”said the boy that everyone else in school, excepting only the two of them,now believed to be her true love. Harry Potter’s spoon absentmindedlystirred his breakfast cereal; he hadn’t taken many bites of it this morning,not that Hermione had seen. “Every good thing in the world brings itsown opposition into existence. Phoenixes are no exception.”Hermione took another unnoticed bite out of her buttered and cinnamoned toast, and said, “How can anyone not understand that Fawkesthinks you’re a good enough person to ride around on your shoulder? Hewouldn’t do that with a Dark Wizard! He just wouldn’t!”And she hadn’t yelled at anyone about Fawkes’s touch on her owncheek, because she knew it wouldn’t be right—that if a phoenix touchedyou, you weren’t supposed to brag about it, that wasn’t what a phoenixwas for.But she’d really hoped that it would squash the rumors about HarryPotter going evil and Hermione Granger following him down.And it hadn’t.And she truly couldn’t understand why not.Harry ate another bite of his cereal, his eyes going distant now, nolonger meeting her own. “Think of it this way: You skip school one day,and you lie and tell your teacher you were sick. The teacher tells you tobring a doctor’s note, so you forge one. The teacher says she’s going tocall the doctor to check, so you have to give her a fake number for thedoctor, and get a friend to pretend to be the doctor when she calls—”“You did what?”Harry looked up from his cereal then, and now he was smiling. “I’mnot saying I really did that, Hermione…” Then his eyes abruptly droppedback down to his cereal. “No. Just an example. Lies propagate, that’s whatI’m saying. You’ve got to tell more lies to cover them up, lie about everyfact that’s connected to the first lie. And if you kept on lying, and you kepton trying to cover it up, sooner or later you’d even have to start lying aboutthe general laws of thought. Like, someone is selling you some kind of alternative medicine that doesn’t work, and any double-blind experimentalstudy will confirm that it doesn’t work. So if someone wants to go on defending the lie, they’ve got to get you to disbelieve in the experimentalmethod. Like, the experimental method is just for merely scientific kindsof medicine, not amazing alternative medicine like theirs. Or a good andvirtuous person should believe as strongly as they can, no matter whatthe evidence says. Or truth doesn’t exist and there’s no such thing as objective reality. A lot of common wisdom like that isn’t just mistaken, it’santi-epistemology, it’s systematically wrong. Every rule of rationality thattells you how to find the truth, there’s someone out there who needs youto believe the opposite. If you once tell a lie, the truth is ever after yourenemy; and there’s a lot of people out there telling lies—” Harry’s voicestopped.“What does that have to do with Fawkes?” she said.Harry withdrew his spoon from his cereal, and pointed in the direction of the Head Table. “The Headmaster has a phoenix, right? And he’sChief Warlock of the Wizengamot? So he’s got political opponents, likeLucius. Now, d’you think that opposition is going to just roll over andsurrender, because Dumbledore has a phoenix and they don’t? Do youthink they’ll admit that Fawkes is even evidence that Dumbledore’s a goodperson? Of course not. They’ve got to invent something to say that makesFawkes… not important. Like, phoenixes only follow people who chargestraight at anyone they think is evil, so having a phoenix just means you’rean idiot or a dangerous fanatic. Or, phoenixes just follow people whoare pure Gryffindor, so Gryffindor they don’t have the virtues of otherHouses. Or it just shows how much courage a magical animal thinks youhave, nothing else, and it wouldn’t be fair to judge politicians based onthat. They have to say something to deny the phoenix. I bet Lucius didn’teven have to make up anything new. I bet it had all been said before, centuries ago, since the first time someone had a phoenix riding on his shoulder, and someone else wanted people not to take that into account as evidence. I bet by the time Fawkes came along it was already common wisdom, it would have just seemed strange to take into account who a phoenixliked or disliked. It would be like a Muggle newspaper testing politicalcandidates to rate their level of scientific literacy. Every force for Goodthat exists in this universe, there’s someone else who benefits from people discounting it, or fencing it into a narrow box where it can’t get tothem.”“But—” Hermione said. “Okay, I see why Lucius Malfoy doesn’t wantanyone to think that Fawkes matters, but why does anyone who isn’t a badguy believe it?”Harry Potter gave a little shrug. His spoon dropped back into his cereal, and went on stirring without a pause. “Why does any kind of cynicism appeal to people? Because it seems like a mark of maturity, of sophistication, like you’ve seen everything and know better. Or becauseputting something down feels like pushing yourself up. Or they don’thave a phoenix themselves, so their political instinct tells them there’sno advantage to be gained from saying nice things about phoenixes. Orbecause being cynical feels like knowing a secret truth that common people don’t know…” Harry Potter looked in the direction of the Head Table,and his voice dropped until it was almost a whisper. “I think maybe that’swhat he’s getting wrong—that he’s cynical about everything else, but notabout cynicism itself.”Without thinking, Hermione looked in the direction of the Head Ta*1011 *ble herself, but the Defense Professor’s seat was still empty, as it had beenon Monday and Tuesday; the Deputy Headmistress had pronounced, earlier, that Professor Quirrell’s classes for today would be canceled.Afterward, when Harry had eaten a few bites of treacle tart and thenleft the table, Hermione looked at Anthony and Padma, who had been coincidentally eating nearby but certainly not eavesdropping or anything.Anthony and Padma looked back at her.Padma said hesitantly, “Is it just me, or has Harry Potter started talking like a more complicated sort of book in the last few days? I mean, Ihaven’t been listening to him very long—”“It’s not just you,” said Anthony.Hermione didn’t say anything, but she was becoming increasinglyworried. Whatever had happened to Harry Potter on the day of thephoenix, it had changed him; there was something new in him now.Not cold, but hard. Sometimes she caught him staring out a window atnothing visible, a look of grim determination on his face. In Herbologyclass on Monday, a Venus Fire Trap had gone out of control; and Harryhad tackled Terry out of the way of a fireball even as Professor Sprouthad shouted a Flame-Freezing Charm; and when Harry had risen fromthe floor he’d just gone back to his place like nothing interesting had happened. And when for once she’d gotten a better test score than Harry intheir Transfiguration exam, later that same Monday, Harry had smiledat her as though to congratulate her, instead of gritting his teeth; and…that had bothered her a lot.She was getting the sense that Harry……was pulling away from her…“He seems a lot older all of a sudden,” said Anthony. “Not like a realgrownup, I can’t imagine Harry as a grownup, but it’s like he suddenlyturned into a fourth-year version of… of whatever he is.”“Well,” Padma said. She daintily dabbed a chocolate-flavored sconewith some scone-flavored frosting. “I think Dragon and Sunshine hadbetter ally during the next battle or Mr. Harry Potter is going to smash us.We were allied last time, and even then Chaos almost won—”“Yeah,” said Anthony. “You’re right, Miss Patil. Tell the Dragon General that we want to meet with you—”1012 *“No!” said Hermione. “We shouldn’t have to gang up on General Potter just to stand a chance. That doesn’t make sense, especially now thatnobody can use Muggle things anymore. It’s still twenty-four soldiers inevery army.”Neither Padma or Anthony said anything to that.Knock-knock, knock-knock.“Come in, Mr. Potter,” she said.The door creaked open, and Harry Potter slipped through the opening into her office; he pushed the door shut behind him with one hand,and wordlessly seated himself in the cushioned chair that now stood infront of her desk. She’d Transfigured that chair so often that it sometimes changed form to reflect her mood, without any wand movement orincantation or even conscious intent. Right now, that chair had becomedeeply cushioned, so that as Harry sat down he sank into it, as though thechair were hugging him.Harry didn’t seem to notice. There was an air of quiet determinationabout the boy; his eyes had locked steadily with hers, and not let up for amoment. “You called me?” said the boy.“I did,” said Professor McGonagall. “I have two pieces of good newsfor you, Mr. Potter. First—have you met Mr. Rubeus Hagrid, at all? Thegroundskeeper? He was an old friend of your parents.”Harry hesitated. Then, “Mr. Hagrid spoke to me a bit after I got here,”Harry said. “I think it was on Tuesday of my first week of school. Hedidn’t say he knew my parents, though. At the time I thought he justwanted to introduce himself to the Boy-Who-Lived… did he have somekind of hidden agenda? He didn’t seem like the type…”“Ah…” she said. It took her a moment to pull her thoughts together.“It’s a long story, Mr. Potter, but Mr. Hagrid was falsely accused of murdering a student, five decades ago. Mr. Hagrid’s wand was snapped, andhe was expelled. Later, when Professor Dumbledore became Headmaster, he gave Mr. Hagrid a place here as Keeper of Grounds and Keys.”Harry’s eyes watched her intently. “You said that five decades ago wasthe last time a student died in Hogwarts, and you were certain that fivedecades ago was the last time someone heard the Sorting Hat’s secretmessage.”She felt a slight chill—even the Headmaster or Severus might nothave made that connection that quickly—and said, “Yes, Mr. Potter.Someone opened the Chamber of Secrets, but this was not believed, andMr. Hagrid was blamed for the resulting death. However, the Headmaster has located the additional enchantment on the Sorting Hat, and hehas shown it to a special panel of the Wizengamot. As a result, Mr. Hagrid’s sentence has been revoked—just this morning, in fact—and hewill be allowed to acquire a new wand.” She hesitated. “We… have not yettold Mr. Hagrid of this, Mr. Potter. We were waiting until the deed wasdone, so as not to give him false hope after so long. Mr. Potter… we werewondering if we could tell Mr. Hagrid that it was you who helped him…?”She saw the weighing look in his eyes—“I remember Mr. Hagrid holding you when you were a baby,” she said.“I think he would be very happy to know.”She could see it, though, on Harry’s face, the moment when he decided that Rubeus wouldn’t be any use to him.Harry shook his head. “Bad enough that someone might deduce therewas a Parselmouth in this year’s crop of students,” Harry said. “I think it’dbe more prudent to just keep it all as secret as possible.”She remembered James and Lily, who’d never hesitated to return thefriendship the huge, bluff man had offered them, for all that James wasthe scion of a wealthy House or Lily a budding Charms Mistress, andRubeus a mere half-giant whose wand had been snapped…“Because you don’t expect him to prove useful, Mr. Potter?”There was silence. She hadn’t intended to say that out loud.Sadness crossed Harry’s face. “Probably,” Harry said quietly. “But Idon’t think he and I would get along, do you?”Something seemed to be stuck in her throat.“Speaking of making use of people,” Harry said. “It seems I’m goingto be thrown into a war with a Dark Lord sometime soon. So while I’m inyour office, I’d like to ask that my sleep cycle be extended to thirty hoursper day. Neville Longbottom wants to start practicing dueling, there’s anolder Hufflepuff who offered to teach him, and they invited me to join.Plus there’s other things I want to learn too—and if you or the Headmaster think I should study anything in particular, in order to become a powerful wizard when I grow up, let me know. Please direct Madam Pomfreyto administer the appropriate potion, or whatever it is that she needs todo—”“Mr. Potter!”Harry’s eyes gazed directly into her own. “Yes, Minerva? I know itwasn’t your idea, but I’d like to survive the use the Headmaster’s makingof me. Please don’t be an obstacle to that.”It almost broke her. “Harry,” she whispered in a bare voice, “childrenshouldn’t have to think like that!”“You’re right, they shouldn’t,” Harry said. “A lot of children have togrow up too early, though, not just me; and most children like that wouldprobably trade places with me in five seconds. I’m not going to pity myself, Professor McGonagall, not when there are people out there in realtrouble and I’m not one of them.”She swallowed, hard, and said, “Mr. Potter, at thirty hours per day,you’ll—get older, you’ll age faster—” Like Albus.“And in my fifth year I’ll be around the same physiological age as Hermione,” said Harry. “Doesn’t seem that terrible.” There was a wry smilenow on Harry’s face. “Honestly, I’d probably want this even if there weren’ta Dark Lord. Wizards live for a while, and either wizards or Muggles willprobably push that out even further over the next century. There’s no reason not to pack as many hours into a day as I can. I’ve got things I plan todo, and ‘twere well they were done quickly.”There was a long pause.“All right,” Minerva said. It came out as almost a whisper. She raisedher voice. “All right, Mr. Potter, I shall ask the Headmaster, and if heagrees, it shall be done.”Harry’s eyes narrowed for a moment. “I see. Then please remind theHeadmaster that Godric Gryffindor, in his last words, said that if it hadbeen the right thing for him to do, then he wouldn’t tell anyone else tochoose wrongly, not even the youngest student in Hogwarts.”1015 *And she knew with a hollow feeling that any chance of Albus stopping this, stopping any of this, had just Vanished into nothingness. Thatwas what Albus had told her when she’d objected that Cameron Edwardwas too young, and then when she’d objected that Peter Pevensie was tooyoung, and finally she’d given up objecting. “Who told you that, Mr. Potter?” Not Albus—surely Albus would never say that to any student—“I’ve been doing a lot of reading lately,” Harry said. His body started torise from the enveloping chair, then halted. “Dare I ask about the secondpiece of good news?”“Oh,” she said. “Ah—Professor Quirrell has woken up and says thatyou may—”The Hogwarts infirmary was a brilliantly open space, skylit on all foursides despite seeming to be located squarely in the middle of the castle.White beds in long rows stretched out, only three of them occupied atthe moment. One older boy and one older girl on opposite sides, bothlying motionless with their eyes closed, probably unconscious and spellbound while some healing Charm or Potion reconfigured their bodiesin uncomfortable ways; and the third occupant had the curtain drawnaround their bed, which was presumably a good thing. Madam Pomfrey had pushed him along with a hard shove and told him not to gawk,and Harry had needed to remind himself sharply that some people stilldidn’t know who the Boy-Who-Lived was—either that, or Madam Pomfrey’s identity was bound up with her absolute dominance of her ownhospital, etcetera, whatever.Behind the rows of beds were five doors, leading into the privaterooms where they stored the patients who would be staying for daysinstead of hours, but whose condition didn’t warrant a transfer to St.Mungos.Windowless, skyless, unlit but for a single smokeless torch on one ofthe solid stone walls; that was the room behind the middle door. Harryhad wondered whether professors could ask Hogwarts to change itself;1016 *or if the infirmary always had a room like that available, for people whodidn’t enjoy the light.In the center of the room, between two equal bedstands that looked tohave been carved from the same grey marble as the walls, rested a whitehospital bed, looking vaguely orangish in the unsmoking torchlight; andwithin that bed, a white sheet pulled up about his thighs and wearing ahospital gown, sat Professor Quirrell with his back slightly propped upagainst the headboard of the bed.There was something frightening about seeing Professor Quirrell inone of Madam Pomfrey’s beds, even if the Defense Professor appeared uninjured. Even knowing that Professor Quirrell had deliberately arrangedhis own apparent defeat at Severus’s hands, to give himself an excuse torecover his strength from Azkaban. Harry had never actually watched anyone dying in a hospital bed, but he’d seen too many movies. It was an intimation of mortality, and the Defense Professor was not supposed to bemortal.Madam Pomfrey had told Harry that he was absolutely forbidden topester her patient.Harry had said, “I understand,” which technically did not say anything about obedience.The stern old healer had then turned, and started to say to ProfessorQuirrell that he was absolutely not to overexert himself or… upset himself…Madam Pomfrey had trailed off, hurriedly turned around, and fledthe room.“Not bad,” Harry observed, after the door had shut behind the escaping medical matron. “I’ve got to learn how to do that, sometime.”Professor Quirrell smiled a smile with absolutely no humor content,and said, his voice sounding a good deal dryer than its usual dryness,“Thank you for your artistic critique, Mr. Potter.”Harry stared into the pale blue eyes, and thought that Professor Quirrell looked……older.It was subtle, it might have just been Harry’s imagination, it mighthave been the poor lighting. But the hair above Quirinus Quirrell’s fore*1017 *head might have receded a bit, what remained might have thinned andgreyed, an advancing of the baldness that had already been visible on theback of his head. The face might have grown a little sunken.The pale blue eyes had stayed sharp and intense.“I am glad,” Harry said quietly, “to see you in what appears to be goodhealth.”“Appearances can be deceiving, of course,” said Professor Quirrell. Hegave a flick of his fingers, and when his hand finished the gesture he washolding his wand. “Would you believe that woman thinks she has confiscated this from me?”Six incantations the Defense Professor spoke then; six of the thirtythat he had used to safeguard their important conversations in Mary’sRoom.Harry raised his eyebrows, silently quizzical.“That is all I can manage for now,” said the Defense Professor. “I expect it shall prove sufficient. Still, there is a proverb: If you do not wish athing heard, do not say it. Consider it to apply in full measure. I am toldthat you were trying to see me?”“Yes,” Harry said. He paused, gathered his thoughts. “Did the Headmaster, or anyone, tell you that we can’t go to lunch any more?”“Something along those lines,” said the Defense Professor. And without changing expression, “Of course I was terribly sorry to hear it.”“It’s more extreme than that, actually,” said Harry. “I’m confined toHogwarts and its grounds indefinitely. I can’t leave without a guard and agood reason. I’m not going home for summer, and maybe not ever again.I was hoping… to speak with you, about that.”There was a pause.The Defense Professor exhaled a breath like a brief sigh, and said, “Weshall just have to rely on the known fact that the Deputy Headmistress willpersonally murder anyone who tries to report me. Mr. Potter, I intend tokeep this conversation on track so that we may conclude it quickly, is thatunderstood?”Harry nodded, and—In the light of the single torch, shaded toward the reddish end of theoptical spectrum, the snake’s green scales were not very reflective, andthe blue-and-white banding hardly more so. Dark seemed the snake, inthat light. The eyes, which had seemed like gray pits before, now reflectedthe torchlight, and seemed brighter than the rest of the snake.“Sso,” hissed the venomous creature. “What did you wissh to ssay?”And Harry hissed, “Sschoolmasster thinkss that woman'ss former Lord iss theone who sstole her from prisson.”Harry had thought about it this time, and carefully, before he had decided that he would reveal to Professor Quirrell only that the Headmaster believed that; and not say anything about the prophecy which had setVoldemort on Harry’s parents, nor that the Headmaster was reconstituting the Order of the Phoenix… it was a risk, a significant risk, but Harryneeded an ally in this.“He believess that one iss alive?” the snake finally said. The divided, twopronged tongue flickered rapidly from side to side, sardonic snakishlaughter. “Ssomehow I am not ssurprissed.”“Yess,” Harry hissed dryly, “very amussing, I am ssure. Except now am sstuckin Hogwartss for next ssix years, for ssafety! I have decided that I will, indeed, sseekpower; and conﬁnement iss not helpful for that. Musst convince sschoolmasster thatDark Lord iss not yet awakened, that esscape was work of ssome other power—”Again the rapid flickering of the snake’s tongue; the snakish laughterwas stronger, dryer, this time. “Amateur foolisshnesss.”“Pardon?” hissed Harry.“You ssee misstake, think of undoing, ssetting time back to sstart. Yet not evenwith hourglasss can time be undone. Musst move forward insstead. You think of convincing otherss they are misstaken. Far eassier to convince them they are right. Ssoconssider, boy: what new happensstance would make schoolmasster decide you weressafe once more, ssimultaneoussly advance your other agendass?”Harry stared at the snake, puzzled. His mind tried to comprehendand unravel the riddle—“Iss it not obviouss?” hissed the snake. Again the tongue flickered sardonic laughter. “To free yoursself, to gain power in Britain, you musst again besseen to defeat the Dark Lord.”In reddish-orange flickering torchlight, a green snake swayed above awhite hospital bed, as the boy stared into the embers of its eyes.“Sso,” Harry said finally. “Let uss be clear on what iss propossed. You ssuggesstthat we sset up imposstor to imperssonate Dark Lord.”“Ssomething like that. Woman we resscued will cooperate, sshould be mosst convincing when sshe iss sseen at hiss sside.” More sardonic tongue-flickering. “Youare kidnapped from Hogwartss to public location, many witnesssess, wardss keep outprotectorss. Dark Lord announcess that he hass at long lasst regained physical form,after wandering as sspirit for yearss; ssayss that he hass gained sstill greater power,not even you can sstop him now. Offerss to let you duel. You casst guardian Charm,Dark Lord laughss at you, ssayss he iss not life-eater. Casstss Killing Cursse at you, youblock, watcherss ssee Dark Lord explode—”“Casst Killing Cursse?” Harry hissed in incredulity. “At me? Again? Ssecondtime? Nobody will believe Dark Lord could posssibly be that sstupid—”“You and I are only two people in country who would notice that,” hissed thesnake. “Trusst me on thiss, boy.”“What if there iss third, ssomeday?”The snake swayed thoughtfully. “Could write different sscript for play, if youwissh. Whatever sscenario, sshould leave open posssibility Dark Lord might return yetagain—nation musst think they are sstill dependent on you to protect them.”Harry stared into the red-flickering pits of the snake’s eyes.“Well?” hissed the swaying form.The obvious thought was that going along with the Defense Professor’s plots and deceptions a second time, spinning an even more complicated lie to cover up the first mistake, and creating another fatal vulnerability if anyone ever discovered the truth, would be exactly the same sortof stupidity as the putative Dark Lord using the Killing Curse again. Itdidn’t even take his Hufflepuff side to point that out, Harry thought it inhis very own mental voice.But there was also a certain question as to whether the appropriatemoral to learn from the last experience was to always say no immediatelyto the Defense Professor, or…“Will think about it,” hissed Harry. “Will not ansswer right away, thiss time,will enumerate risskss and beneﬁtss ﬁrsst—”“Undersstood,” hissed the snake. “But remember thiss, boy, other eventss proceed without you. Hessitation iss alwayss eassy, rarely usseful.”The boy emerged from the private room into the main infirmary, runningnervous fingers through his messy black hair as he walked past the whitebeds, occupied and unoccupied.Shortly afterward, the boy emerged from the Hogwarts infirmary entirely, passing Madam Pomfrey on the way out with a distracted nod.The boy walked out into a hallway, then into a larger corridor, andthen stopped and leaned against the wall.The thing was……he really didn’t want to be stuck in Hogwarts for the next six years;and when you thought about it…… the Incident with Rescuing Bellatrix From Azkaban wasn’t just imposing costs on Harry. Other people would be worrying, living in fear ofthe Dark Lord’s return, expending unknown resources to take unknownprecautions. Harry could demand that they write the script in such fashion as to make it seem not plausible that the Dark Lord would return athird time. And then people would relax, it would all be over.Unless of course there actually was a Dark Lord out there to be feared.There had been a prophecy.The boy leaning against the wall vented a soft sigh, and started walking again.Harry had almost forgotten, but he had gotten around to showingProfessor Quirrell the deck of cards he’d been given on Sunday night by‘Santa Claus’, within which the King of Hearts was allegedly a portkey thatwould take him to the Salem Witches’ Institute in America. Although ofcourse Harry hadn’t told Professor Quirrell who’d sent him the card, norwhat it was supposed to do, before he’d asked Professor Quirrell if it waspossible to tell where the portkey would send him.The Defense Professor had transformed back to human form, and examined the King of Hearts, tapping it a few times with his wand.1021 *And according to Professor Quirrell……the portkey would send the user somewhere in London, but hecouldn’t pinpoint it any nearer than that.Harry had shown Professor Quirrell the note that had accompaniedthe deck of cards, saying nothing of the earlier notes.Professor Quirrell had taken it in at a glance, given a dry chuckle, andobserved that if you read the note carefully, it did not explicitly say that theportkey would take him to the Salem Witches’ Institute.You needed to learn to pay attention to that kind of subtlety, ProfessorQuirrell said, if you wanted to be a powerful wizard when you grew up;or, indeed, if you wanted to grow up at all.The boy sighed again as he trudged off to class.He was starting to wonder if all the other wizarding schools were alsolike this, or if it was only Hogwarts that had a problem.essitation iss alwayss eassy, rarely usseful.So the Defense Professor had told him; and while you could quibble about the details of the proverb, Harry understood the weaknesses ofRavenclaws well enough to know that you had to try answering your ownquibbles. Did some plans call for waiting? Yes, many plans called for delayed action; but that was not the same as hesitating to choose. Not delayingbecause you knew the right moment to do what was necessary, but delaying because you couldn’t make up your mind—there was no cunningplan which called for that.Did you sometimes need more information to choose? Yes, but thatcould also turn into an excuse for delaying; and it would be tempting to delay, when you were faced with a choice between two painful alternatives,and not choosing would avoid the mental pain for a time. So you wouldpick a piece of information you couldn’t easily obtain, and claim that youcouldn’t possibly decide without it; that would be your excuse. Althoughif you knew what information you needed, knew when and how you wouldobtain that information, and knew what you would do depending on eachpossible observation, then that was less suspicious as an excuse for hesitating.If you weren’t just hesitating, you ought to be able to choose in advancewhat you would do, once you had the extra information you claimed youneeded.If the Dark Lord were really out there, would it be smart to go alongwith Professor Quirrell’s plan to have someone impersonate the DarkLord?No. Definitely no. Absolutely not.And if Harry knew for a fact that the Dark Lord wasn’t really out there…in that case…The Defense Professor’s office was a small room, at least today; ithad changed since the last time Harry had seen it, the stone of the roombecoming darker, more polished. Behind the Defense Professor’s deskstood the single empty bookcase that always decorated the room, a tallbookcase stretching almost from the floor to the ceiling, with sevenempty wooden shelves. Harry had only once seen Professor Quirrell takea book from those empty shelves, and never seen him put a book back.The green snake swayed above the seat of the chair behind the Defense Professor’s desk, the lidless eyes staring unblinking at Harry fromclose to his own eye level.They were warded now by twenty-two spells, all that could be castwithin Hogwarts without attracting the Headmaster’s attention.“No,” hissed Harry.The green snake cocked its head, tilting it slightly; no emotion wasconveyed by the gesture, not that Harry’s Parselmouth talent conveyedto him. “Reasson not?” said the green snake.“Too rissky,” Harry said simply. That was true whether or not the DarkLord was out there. Forcing himself to decide in advance had made himrealize that he’d just been using the unanswered question as an excuse tohesitate; the sane decision was the same, either way.For a moment the dark pitted eyes seemed to gleam blackly, for a moment the scaled mouth gaped to expose the fangs. “Think you have learnedwrong lessson, boy, from previouss failure. My planss are not in habit of failing, andlasst one would have gone flawlesssly, but for your own foolisshnesss. Correct lesssoniss to follow ssteps laid down for you by older and wisser Sslytherin, tame your wildimpulssess.”“Lessson I learned is not to try plotss that would make girl-child friend think I amevil or boy-child friend think I am sstupid,” Harry snapped back. He’d been plan* 1024 *ning a more temporizing response than that, but somehow the words hadjust slipped out.The sssss-ing sound that came from the snake was not heard by Harryas words, only as pure fury. A moment later, “You told them—”“Of coursse not! But know what they would ssay.”There was a long pause as the snake-head swayed, staring at Harry;again no detectable emotion came through, and Harry wondered whatProfessor Quirrell could be thinking that would take Professor Quirrellthat long to think.“You sserioussly care what thosse two think?” came the snake’s final hiss.“True younglingss thosse two are, not like you. Could not weigh adult matterss.”“Might have done better than me,” Harry hissed. “Boy-child friend would haveassked after ssecret motivess before asssenting to resscue woman—”“Glad you undersstand that now,” the snake hissed coldly. “Alwayss assk after other'ss advantage. Next learn to alwayss assk after your own. If my plan iss notto your tasste, what iss yours?”“If necesssary—sstay at sschool ssix yearss and sstudy. Hogwartss sseemss ﬁneplace to dwell. Bookss, friendss, sstrange but tassty food.” Harry wanted tochuckle, but there wasn’t any gesture in Parseltongue for the kind oflaughter he wanted to express.The pits of the snake’s eyes seemed almost black. “Eassy to ssay that now.Ssuch as you and I, we do not tolerate imprissonment. You will losse patience long before sseventh year, perhapss before end of thiss one. I sshall plan accordingly.”And before Harry could hiss another word of Parseltongue, thehuman-shape of Professor Quirrell was sitting in his chair once more.“So, Mr. Potter,” said the Defense Professor, his voice as calm as if theyhad been discussing nothing important, as if the whole conversation hadnot occurred at all, “I hear that you have begun to practice dueling. Notthe worthless sort with rules, I hope?”Hannah Abbott looked as unnerved as Hermione had ever seen her (except on the day of the phoenix, the day Bellatrix Black had escaped, whichshouldn’t ought to count for anyone). The Hufflepuff girl had come overto the Ravenclaw table during dinner, and tapped Hermione on her shoulder, and very nearly dragged her away—“Neville and Harry Potter are learning dueling from Mr. Diggory!”Hannah blurted as soon as they were a few steps away from the table.“Who?” said Hermione.“Cedric Diggory!” said Hannah. “He’s the Captain of our QuidditchTeam, and general of an army, and he’s taking all the electives and getting better grades than anyone, and I hear he learns dueling from professional tutors during the summers, and he once beat two seventh-yearstudents, and even some teachers call him the Super Hufflepuff, and Professor Sprout says we should all emu, uh, emudate him or something likethat, and—”After Hannah finally stopped for air (the list had gone on for a while),Hermione managed to insert a word in edgewise.“Sunshine Soldier Abbott!” said Hermione. “Calm down. We’re notgoing to be fighting General Diggory, right? Sure, Neville’s studying tobeat us, but we can study too—”“Don’t you see?” Hannah shrieked, raising her voice a lot louder than itshould’ve been, if they were trying to keep the conversation private fromall the Ravenclaws looking at them. “Neville isn’t studying to beat us! He’spracticing so he can fight Bellatrix Black! They’re going to go through uslike a Bludger through a stack of pancakes!”The Sunshine General gave her soldier a look. “Listen,” said Hermione, “I don’t think a few weeks of practice is going to make anyone aninvincible fighter. Plus we already know how to handle invincible fighters. We’ll concentrate fire on them and they’ll go down just like Draco.”The Hufflepuff girl was looking at her with mixed admiration andskepticism. “Aren’t you even, you know, worried?”“Oh, honestly!” said Hermione. Sometimes it was hard being the onlysensible person in your whole school year. “Haven’t you ever heard thesaying, the only thing we have to fear is fear itself?”“What?” said Hannah. “That’s crazy, what about Lethifolds lurkingin the darkness, and being put under the Imperius Curse, and horribleTransfiguration accidents and—”“I mean,” said Hermione, exasperation leaking out into her nowraised voice, she’d been hearing this sort of thing all week now, “howabout if we wait until after the Chaos Legion actually crushes us to get soscared of them and did you just mutter ‘Gryffindors’ under your voice?”A few moments later, Hermione was walking back to her place at thetable with a sweet smile plastered onto her young face, it wasn’t the terrible cold glare of Harry’s dark side but it was the scariest face she knewhow to make.Harry Potter was going down.“This is loony,” gasped Neville, with what tiny amount of breath he couldspare from being completely out of breath.“This is brilliant!” said Cedric Diggory. The eyes of the Super Hufflepuff gleamed with manic enthusiasm, shining like the sweat on hisforehead as he stamped his feet through the dance of one of his duelingpostures. His usually-light steps had changed to heavier stomps, whichmight have had something to do with the Transfigured metal weightsthey’d all attached to their arms and legs and strapped over their chests.“Where do you get these ideas, Mr. Potter?”“A strange old shop… in Oxford… and I’m never… shopping there…again.” Thud.n the high reaches of Hogwarts where rooms and corridors changed ona daily basis, where the territory itself was uncertain and not just themap, where the stability of the castle began to fray into dreams and chaoswithout changing its architectural style or apparent solidity—in the highreaches of Hogwarts, a battle would soon be fought.The presence of so many students would stabilize the corridors for atime, by dint of constant observation. The rooms and corridors of Hogwarts sometimes moved even while people looked directly at them, butthey wouldn’t change. Even after eight centuries, Hogwarts was still a little shy about changing in front of people.But despite that transient permanence (the Defense Professor hadsaid) the upper reaches of Hogwarts still had a military realism: you hadto learn the ground anew each time, and check every closet for secret corridors all over again.Sunday it was, Sunday the first of March. Professor Quirrell had recovered enough to supervise battles once more, and they were all catchingup on the backlog.The Dragon General, Draco Malfoy, watched two compasses he heldin either hand. One compass was the color of the Sun, the other had amulticolored, iridescent sheen to indicate Chaos. The other two generals, Draco knew, had been given their own compasses; only HermioneGranger’s hand, and Harry Potter’s hand, would hold a compass that wasorange-red and flickered in its reflections like fire, pointing always to thedirection of the largest active contingent of Dragon Army.Without those compasses they might have searched for days andnever found each other, which was a territorial hazard of fighting in theupper levels of Hogwarts.Draco had a bad feeling about what would happen when DragonArmy found the Chaos Legion. Harry Potter had changed since BellatrixBlack had escaped; the Heir of Slytherin had begun to seem truly Lordlynow (and how had Professor Quirrell known that would happen?) Dracowould have felt a lot better with Hermione Granger standing alongside him with her twenty-three Sunshine Soldiers in tow, but no, theSunshine General was being stupidly proud and refusing to accept aidagainst General Potter. She wanted to take down Potter herself, she’dtold him.The Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy had maintained theirinfluence over Britain for centuries by understanding that you couldn’talways be the most powerful. Sometimes another Lord was just stronger,and you had to settle for merely being his foremost lieutenant. You couldbuild up quite a position of wealth and power over a dozen generations ofbeing second in command. You just had to be careful, each time, not tolet your House be dragged down with the fall of the Lord you served. Thatwas the Malfoy tradition which centuries of experience had honed…And so Father had thoroughly explained to Draco that if he ran intosomeone who was obviously stronger than him, Draco was not to resentthis and not to deny it and not to throw a tantrum that could sabotage hispotential position, but Draco was to make sure that his place in the nextgeneration’s power structure wasn’t any lower than second.Granger, apparently, had never gotten this lecture from her own parents, and was still in denial about the obvious fact that Harry Potter wasbecoming stronger than her.So Draco had secretly met with Captain Goldstein and Captain Bonesand Captain Macmillan and they’d agreed to all do their best to make surethat Dragon and Sunshine didn’t engage each other before they engagedthe larger threat of Chaos.It wasn’t really violating the agreement against traitors, you weren’tsoliciting traitors if you honestly meant to help the other army.A high ringing tone belled through the corridors to signal the startof the battle, and a moment later Draco shouted “Go!” and the Dragonsstarted running. It would tire his soldiers, it would cost them somethingeven after they stopped and caught their breath, but they had to put Chaosdirectly between themselves and the Sunshine Regiment.Harry and Neville walked at a leisurely pace through the corridors, Harrywatching the yellow-golden compass that pointed toward the location ofthe Sunshine Regiment, and Neville keeping a lookout just in case theyran into someone else.Their footsteps sounded a bit thumpy, if you listened closely.“So,” the Chaotic Lieutenant said after a while. “That’s why you hadus practice dueling with all that weight strapped on?”Harry nodded, keeping his eyes on the compass that led to Sunshine;if the apparent direction started to change quickly then they were gettingclose.“I didn’t want to say anything in front of the others, but a couple ofweeks isn’t a lot of time to put on extra muscle,” said Neville. “And thebalance is different, and I think this weighs more actually, and doesn’tthis count as Transfiguring a Muggle artifact?”“Nope,” Harry said. “I checked that in advance. You can see it in Hogwarts statues, so some wizards used to wear it, even if they were just beingfashionable for the Dark Ages.” And since nobody would ever try this ifthey weren’t fighting first-year students using weak spells like the SleepHex, it didn’t count as giving away good ideas, either.They came to a Y-intersection, an annoying one; neither corridor bentin quite the right way to take them on a direct intercept course towardwhere Sunshine would go as they followed the Chaos Legion followingDragon Army. So Harry chose what seemed like the better of the two options, and Neville followed.“We’d better try a quick Silencing Charm on this stuff when we getclose,” Neville said. “It’s kind of noisy, they might figure it out.”Harry nodded, and then said “Good idea” in case Neville hadn’t beenlooking at him.They trudged on through the stone-floored corridor of the upperreach of Hogwarts, lit by windows of plain glass or stained glass, nowand then passing statues of witches and dragons and even the occasionalwizard-knight in plate armor or chainmail.The Sunshine Soldiers were striding through a long, wide corridor withtheir wands out and pointed. They couldn’t use the Prismatic Shieldwhile they were maneuvering, but Parvati Patil and Jenny Rustad werecurrently maintaining Contegos around the officer group, who would bethe first targets of any ambush.Their tactic for the next battle, she and her officers had decided,would be to mix directly in with the enemy soldiers as fast as possible—after having practiced among themselves how to support one another,avoid hitting each other, and get into positions where enemy soldierswould hesitate to fire. They’d only gotten in four hours practice, butshe thought her troops would already be better at that kind of mixed-infighting than soldiers who hadn’t practiced at all. It seemed like the sortof tactic Chaos would use, but they hadn’t actually used it yet.It was a good strategy, she believed. And yet still, no matter how muchshe’d lectured her soldiers, they’d persisted in whispering fearful rumorsabout what Harry and Neville were learning to do. Finally she’d goneoff and talked with Captain Goldstein, who understood things like TroopMorale, and Anthony had suggested—“That’s weird,” Captain Macmillan spoke up suddenly, frowning atthe fiery and iridescent compasses he held in either hand. (Ernie was,as Harry would have termed it, “good at spatial visualization”, and so hadbeen designated to hold both compasses and try to figure out what theirenemies were doing.) “I think… Dragon’s not moving fast anymore… Ithink they got on the other side of Chaos from us first… and it looks likeChaos is moving to attack them instead of trying to maneuver out fromin between?”Hermione frowned, trying to understand, and she saw similar frownson the faces of Anthony and Ron. If Chaos and Dragon attacked eachother straight out, and spent all their forces fighting each other, that waspractically conceding the battle to Sunshine…“Potter thinks we’re allied so he’s attacking Malfoy now, beforeDragon can link up with us,” said Blaise Zabini from the common ranksof soldiers. “Or Potter just thinks he can beat both armies in a row, if heattacks them separately.” The Slytherin boy gave a condescending sigh.“Are you going to promote me back to officer now? You lot are hopelesswithout me, you know.”They all ignored the talking noises coming from Zabini’s mouth.“We still moving in the right direction?” said Anthony.“Yeah,” said Ernie.“We getting close to them?” said Ron.“Not yet—”That was when the huge black-wooden doors at the end of the corridor flew open and crashed into the wall, revealing two figures almostcompletely enveloped in grey cloaks, grey cloth stretched over the facesbeneath the grey hoods, one of those figures already raising a wand andpointing it directly at her.And then the face of the game changed drastically, as Harry’s voice,high and strained with the effort, screamed the word:“Stupefy!”The dueling-grade stunner blasted toward her, she was so shockedthat she didn’t start to move until almost too late, as the red jet of lightsmashed right through the Contego shield to their front and she just barelydodged, there was a tingle on her arm as the red light went past her, andshe saw out of the corner of her eye Susan getting hit and blown off herfeet into Ron—“Somnium!” bellowed Anthony’s voice, followed a moment later by adozen voices crying “Somnium!”Hermione frantically pushed herself to her feet, and as she rose, shesaw the two figures in the grey cloaks just standing there.You couldn’t see Sleep Hexes, the spell was too weak—But there was no way they all could’ve missed.“Stupefy!” shrieked the voice of Neville Longbottom, and another redjet shot at her, she fell in an undignified heap as she desperately twistedout of the way, and when she scrambled up, panting, she saw that thistime the stunbolt had gotten Ron where he’d been rising from the ground.“Hello there, Sunshine,” said Harry’s voice from beneath his hood.“We’re the Grey Knights of Chaos,” said Neville’s voice.“We’ll be your opponents for this battle,” said Harry’s voice, “whileChaos’s other army slaughters the Dragons.”“And by the way,” said Neville’s voice, “we’re invincible.”The two boys in their grey cloaks and robes, grey cloth over their faces,stood facing Sunshine’s entire army, seemingly unfazed by a dozen SleepHexes.Daphne heard a soft sigh from beside her, and when her head turnedshe saw that Hannah’s lips were parted, and the Hufflepuff girl’s eyeswere huge, and she was staring at—It would have been hard to describe the jumble of thoughts thatflashed through Daphne’s mind as she realized that Hannah was staring at Neville rather than Harry, which in turn seemed to trigger somepart of her into noticing that in point of fact Neville had been gettingpretty interesting lately as boys went, in fact right now the Last Scion ofLongbottom was seeming downright cool, and something woke up insideher and her own lips parted and everything the Lady her Mother hadever instructed her about demure demeanors and flattery and scentedshampoo blew straight out of her mind so hard it should have fluffed herhair about her ears, because she’d watched Hermione and Harry and sheknew how she wanted her own courtship to go—Her Lady Mother had also recently instructed her on a few spells itmight be embarrassing not to know if you belonged to the Noble andMost Ancient House of Greengrass.Daphne’s wand swung to point to her left, and she shouted “Tonare!”The wand went over her head, and she spoke the incantation “RavumCalvaria!”And finally she grasped her wand in both hands and shrieked, “LucisGladius!”The huge magical drain almost sent her to her knees, but she bore it,and when the blazing shape had fully formed and stabilized the drain wasa little less.Still, she had a feeling she’d better not try to fight with this for long.That everyone was staring at her went quite without saying, and sheshould have leaped forward to confront Neville with her hair billowingaround her, but it was all she could do to walk forward steadily to level herMost Ancient Blade at Neville Longbottom. That everyone moved asideand made way for her also went without saying.“I hight Daphne, of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Greengrass!” shecried. “Greengrass of Sunshine!” The dueling forms had gone completelyout of her mind, she’d seen enough plays to remember death challengesand blood challenges but she couldn’t remember at all what was appropriate for this, so she just pointed the incandescent sword toward the objectof her crush and yelled, “Let’s see what you got, Nevvy!”Once again Harry’s voice shrieked “Stupefy!”, and later on, when shewas remembering this, she could never quite believe she’d managed to doit, but she slashed out with her blade of light like it was a Beater’s bat, andhit the stunbolt back at Harry who just barely managed to twist out of theway.“Tonare!” shouted Neville, of the Noble and Most Ancient House ofLongbottom. “Ravum Calvaria, Lucis Gladius!”For a few seconds, no one did anything but stare at Neville and Daphne asthey started whacking at each other. They were both moving slowly, andHermione guessed that the spell was taking a lot of strength out of them.It wasn’t very impressive by comparison, if you were a Muggleborn andyou’d watched certain movies.But you still had to give them extra credit for using lightsabers at all.“Point of order,” said Harry’s voice. “I know the Defense Professor iswatching, but I still have to ask, does anyone know whether they’ll sliceeach other in half if they actually hit—”“No,” Hermione said absently. This had been in one of her historybooks, though she’d had no idea the magical dueling sword looked likethat. “They cast it so it’ll only stun if it touches.”“You know that spell?”“Oh, no, it’s the Charm of the Most Ancient Blade, it’s only legal forNoble and Most Ancient Houses to use—”Hermione stopped talking and looked at Harry, or Harry’s grey hoodrather.“Well,” said Harry’s voice, “I guess I could take down the rest of theSunshine Regiment by myself, then.” She couldn’t see his face, but hisvoice sounded like he was smiling.“You dodged when Daphne hit your own spell back at you,” Hermionesaid. “So whatever you did, you’re not invincible. A Stupefy can still getyou.”“Interesting theory,” said Harry’s voice from beneath the hood. “Gotanyone in your army who can test it?”“I read about the Stunning Hex once,” said Hermione. “A few monthsago. I wonder if I can remember the instructions right?” Her wand cameup to point at Harry.There was a slight pause, as nearby a boy and a girl breathing in audible gasps slowly whacked at each other with lightsabers.“Of course,” Harry said, leveling his own wand on her, “I can just useSomnium on you. That’ll take a lot less effort.”New Contego shields sprung into existence in front of her, cast byJenny and Parvati, even as Harry spoke.The tip of Hermione’s own wand began making small motions in theair, a diamond within a circle, a diamond within a circle, rehearsing thegesture to match exactly what she remembered seeing in the book. Itwould be a difficult feat even for her, but she had to cast the spell righton the first try, she couldn’t afford any failed castings that would sap herenergy.“You know,” said Hermione Granger, “I understand that it’s not reallyyour fault, but I’m getting tired of hearing people talk about the Boy-WhoLived like you’re—like you’re some kind of god or something.”“Same here, I must say,” said Harry Potter. “It’s sad how people keepunderestimating me.”Her wand kept rehearsing the diamond within the circle, over andover. Harry would be recharging his own strength, she knew, even as shepracticed as much as she could before her attack. “I’m starting to thinkyou need taking down a peg, General Chaos.”“You could be right,” Harry said equably. His feet began to shufflethrough what she recognized as a duelist’s dance. “Unfortunately there’snothing left that can defeat me now except another Harry Potter.”“Let me be specific, Mr. Potter. I’m taking you down a peg.”“You and what other army?”“You think you’re pretty cool, don’t you,” said Hermione.“Why, yes,” said Harry. “Yes, I do. Some might call that arrogant, butam I supposed to be the last person in Hogwarts to notice how awesomeI am?”Hermione raised her left hand into the air, and made a fist.It was a signal. Eight designated soldiers in her army would be pointing their wands at her, and quietly casting Wingardium Leviosa.They’d practiced this, too, once Hermione had given up on lecturingher soldiers, and at Anthony’s suggestion, tried giving them a SunshineGeneral who looked like she could defeat invincible enemies.“You pretend you’re Superman,” said Hermione. She raised her leftfist higher in the air, and the eight soldiers supporting her Hovered heroff the ground. “Well here’s Super Hermione!” Her hand pushed forward,and as she shot rapidly through the air toward Harry, regretting only thatshe couldn’t see the look on his face, her wand made a diamond withina circle and she summoned up all the magic she could, it felt like sheimagined touching a live wire would feel as the too-powerful spell pouredthrough her when her voice screamed “Stupefy!”The red bolt burst from her wand, perfectly formed.Harry dodged it.And then, because they hadn’t practiced doing this part inside of hallways, she crashed into a wall.“Somnium!” shrieked Draco, and then after only a few seconds to recharge,He knew he was hitting Theodore, the other boy wasn’t even trying tododge, but the scion of Nott only grinned as evilly as his father and leveledhis wand—Draco managed to leap aside just as Theodore said “Somnium!” butDraco was getting winded, he couldn’t keep this up, Theodore wasn’tbothering to dodge at all while Draco had to keep moving, this was crazy.He had enough strength now to fire again, but—Stupidity is doing the same thing and expecting a different result, Harry hadsaid, this was Harry’s work somehow, it couldn’t be a Muggle artifact anymore but Draco couldn’t figure out what it could be, and he should bethinking of hypotheses and ways to test them but he was too busy frantically dodging as Theodore laughed and shot another Sleep Hex at him,Draco felt a little numbness in his side that time as he twisted, that hadbeen a very very near miss and finally Draco couldn’t take it anymore, hedidn’t bother working out what theory he was testing or why as he just—“Luminos!” shouted Draco, and Theodore was haloed in red light, “Dulak!” and it went out again (so Theodore was still being affected by magic),“Expelliarmus!” and Theodore’s wand went flying (that had been a goodspell to cast anyway now that Draco realized it) but Theodore was rushing toward Draco with his arms outstretched to grapple so Draco yelled“Flipendo!” and the other boy’s feet were abruptly yanked up——and Theodore’s back hit the ground with a surprisingly loud andmetallic-sounding crash.Draco’s vision was swimming now from casting four spells in suchfast succession, and Theodore was already scrambling to his feet, so therewasn’t even time to think in words, but Draco still managed to say “Somnium!” and this time he aimed for Theodore’s face instead of the chest.Theodore dodged (he dodged!) and the boy shouted “Code seven on Malfoy!”“Prismatis!” cried Padma’s voice and there was suddenly a shimmering rainbow wall in front of Draco, just as four Chaotic voices cried “Somnium!”And there was a pause, as everyone looked at the huge PrismaticSphere protecting the remnants of Dragon Army.Casting that fifth spell had sent Draco to his hands and knees, buthe looked up and managed to say, as clearly as he could, “If the SleepHex—doesn’t work—aim for the face—I think the Lieutenants are wearing metal shirts.”“You’ve already lost too many soldiers,” Finnigan said loudly fromacross the barrier, “we’ll beat you anyway,” and then the Gryffindor boylaughed evilly. He did the evil laughter almost as well as Harry Potter bynow, and the other Chaotic Legionnaires started laughing with him soonafterward.Draco could see from the corner of his eye where Gregory and Vincentlay unconscious. Padma was still sustaining the Prismatic Sphere, thelargest one he’d ever seen her cast; but she was breathing hard, still visiblysweaty from when they’d all jogged to get into position, the Ravenclawgirl was a strong witch but not an athletic one.He really hoped General Granger got here soon and hit Chaos frombehind. General Potter and Neville of Chaos were missing, and Dracocould guess where they’d gone, but two soldiers couldn’t delay the wholeSunshine Regiment for too long all by themselves, could they?She knew it wasn’t fair, that the other girl had given all she could, butHermione still wished that Daphne had lasted longer.“Lagann!” said Neville’s voice from behind her as she flew, and therewas the sound of a Prismatic Wall shattering, Hannah’s voice desperatelycried “Somnium!” and then a few moments later Neville’s voice calmly said“Somnium” and there was the thud of another of her soldiers falling over.And the force keeping her in the air diminished again, Hermionecould feel the grab of the Hover Charms straining at her, but now it justwasn’t enough.Her flight stopped and she began falling in slow motion toward theground, and she should’ve signaled her soldiers to just drop her, but shewas too angry and confused and not thinking fast enough and still trying to muster the strength for one last Stunning Hex, and so there wasnowhere to go when Harry pointed his wand at her and said “Somnium”and that was the last word that Hermione Granger heard of her battle.ermione wasn’t feeling very nice right now, or Good either, there wasa hot ball of anger burning inside her and she wondered if this wassomething like Harry’s darkness (though it probably wasn’t even close)and she shouldn’t have felt that way over some silly little game but—Her whole army. Two soldiers had beaten her whole army. That waswhat she’d been told after she woke up.It was a little too much.“Well,” Professor Quirrell said. From up close the Defense Professordidn’t look quite as healthy as he had the last time she’d been in his office;his skin looked paler, and he moved a little slower. His expression was asstern as ever, and his gaze as penetrating; his fingers tapped sharply onhis desk, rap-rap. “I would guess that of the three of you, only Mr. Malfoyhas guessed why I’ve asked you here.”“Something to do with Noble and Most Ancient Houses?” said Harryfrom beside her, sounding puzzled. “I didn’t violate some kind of crazylaw by firing on Daphne, did I?”“Not quite,” the man said with heavy irony. “Since Miss Greengrassdid not invoke the correct dueling forms, she is not entitled to demandthat you be stripped of your House name. Although of course I wouldnot have permitted a formal duel. Wars do not respect such rules.” TheDefense Professor leaned forward and rested his chin on steepled hands,as though sitting upright had already tired him. His eyes gazed at them,sharp and dangerous. “General Malfoy. Why did I call you here?”“General Potter against the two of us isn’t a fair fight anymore,” DracoMalfoy said in a quiet voice.“What?” blurted Hermione. “We almost had them, if Daphne hadn’tfainted—”“Miss Greengrass did not faint from magical exhaustion,” ProfessorQuirrell said dryly. “Mr. Potter shot her in the back with a Sleep Hex whileyour soldiers were distracted by the sight of their general flying into awall. But congratulations nonetheless, Miss Granger, on almost defeatingtwo Chaotic Legionnaires with a mere twenty-four Sunshine Soldiers.”The blood flaming in her cheeks grew a little hotter. “That—that wasjust—if I’d only figured out he was wearing armor—”Professor Quirrell gazed at her from over touched fingers. “Of coursethere are ways you could have won, Miss Granger. There always are, inevery lost battle. The world around us redunds with opportunities, explodes with opportunities, which nearly all folk ignore because it wouldrequire them to violate a habit of thought; in every battle a thousand Hufflepuff bones waiting to be sharpened into spears. If you had thought totry a massed Finite Incantatem on general principles, you would have dispelled Mr. Potter’s suit of chainmail and everything else he was wearingexcept his underwear, which leads me to suspect that Mr. Potter did notquite realize his own vulnerability. Or you could have had your soldiersswarm Mr. Potter and Mr. Longbottom and physically wrest the wandsfrom their hands. Mr. Malfoy’s own response was not what I would termwell-reasoned, but at least he did not wholly ignore his thousand alternatives.” A sardonic smile. “But you, Miss Granger, had the misfortune toremember how to cast the Stunning Hex, and so you did not search yourexcellent memory for a dozen easier spells that might have proved efficacious. And you pinned all your army’s hopes on your own person, sothey lost spirit when you fell. Afterward they continued to cast their futileSleep Hexes, governed by the habits of fighting that had been trained intothem, unable to break the pattern as Mr. Malfoy did. I cannot quite comprehend what goes through people’s minds when they repeat the samefailed strategy over and over, but apparently it is an astonishingly rare realization that you can try something else. And so the Sunshine Regimentwas wiped out by two soldiers.” The Defense Professor grinned mirth* 1042 *lessly. “One perceives certain similarities to how fifty Death Eaters dominated all of magical Britain, and how our much-loved Ministry continuesin its rule.”The Defense Professor sighed. “Nonetheless, Miss Granger, the fact remains that this is not the first such defeat for you. In the previous battle,you and Mr. Malfoy united your forces, and yet you were fought to a standstill, so that you and Mr. Malfoy had to pursue Mr. Potter onto the roof.The Chaos Legion has now demonstrated, twice in succession, militarystrength equal to both other armies combined. This leaves me no choice.General Potter, you will select eight soldiers from your army, includingat least one Chaotic Lieutenant, to be divided among Dragon Army andthe Sunshine Regiment—”“What?” Hermione burst out again, she glanced over at the other generals and saw that Harry looked as shocked as her, while Draco Malfoyonly looked resigned.“General Potter is stronger than both of you together,” Professor Quirrell said with calm precision. “Your contest is over, he has won, and it istime to rebalance the three armies to present him with a renewed challenge.”“Professor Quirrell!” said Harry. “I didn’t—”“This is my decision as the Professor of Battle Magic at the HogwartsSchool of Witchcraft and Wizardry and it is not subject to negotiation.”The words were still precise, but the look in Professor Quirrell’s eyeschilled Hermione’s blood, even though he was glaring at Harry and notat her. “And I find it suspicious, Mr. Potter, that the moment you wishedto isolate Miss Granger and Mr. Malfoy and force them to chase youonto the roof, you were able to annihilate just exactly as much of theirunited force as you pleased. Indeed, that is the level of performance Iexpected of you since the start of this year, and I am annoyed to discoverthat you have been holding back in my classes this entire time! I haveseen what you can truly do, Mr. Potter. You are far beyond the pointwhere Mr. Malfoy or Miss Granger can fight you on an equal level, andyou will not be permitted to pretend otherwise. This, Mr. Potter, I tell youin my capacity as your professor: For you to learn to your full potential,you must exercise your full abilities and not hold back for any reason—particularly not childish frets over what your friends might think!”She left the Defense Professor’s office with a larger army, and less dignity, and feeling a lot like a sad little bug that had just been squished, andtrying very very hard not to cry.“I wasn’t holding back!” Harry said as soon as they turned the first corner away from Professor Quirrell’s office, the moment the wooden doorfaded out of sight behind the stone walls. “I wasn’t pretending, I never leteither of you win!”She didn’t answer, couldn’t answer, it would all break loose if she triedto say a word.“Really?” said Draco Malfoy. The Dragon General still had that air ofresignation. “Because Quirrell’s right, you know, it’s suspicious that youcould beat nearly everyone in both our armies as soon as you wanted tomake us chase you onto the roof. And didn’t you say something then, Potter, about us needing to beat you when you were fighting for real?”answered back when spoken to. The entrance to the Chamber of Secrets,it seemed, hadn’t been meant to be found in a day.Harry had talked to all of Hermione’s friends that would still talk tohim, and none of them had remembered Hermione saying anything specific about why she’d believed that Draco was plotting against her.Professor Quirrell hadn’t come back from the Ministry as of dinnertime. The older students seemed to think that this year’s Defense Professor would probably end up being blamed for the incident, and fired forteaching Hogwarts students to be too violent. They’d talked about theDefense Professor as though he were already gone.Harry had used up all six hours from his Time-Turner, and there werestill no clues, and he had to go to sleep now if he wanted to be functionalat Hermione’s trial the next day.The Boy-Who-Destroyed-A-Dementor was standing in the middle ofthe Hogwarts trophy room, his wand dropped at his feet.He was crying.Sometimes you call your brain and it doesn’t answer.The trial of Hermione Granger started on schedule the next day.he Most Ancient Hall of the Wizengamot is cool and dark, with concentric half-circles of stone rising up from the lowest center, andsimple wooden benches set down upon those elevated half-circles. Thereis no source of light, but the chamber is well-lit, without any apparentcause or reason; it is simply a brute fact that the hall is well-lit. The wallslike the floor are stone, dark stone, some elegant and mysterious conjugation of rock most fine to gaze upon, with a smooth texture that seemsto flow and shift beneath its surface. This is the Most Ancient Hall, theoldest place of wizardry that has lasted into the modern day; every otherplace of power was destroyed in one war or another. This is the Hall ofthe Wizengamot, which is most ancient because the wars ended with thebuilding of this place.This is the Hall of the Wizengamot; there are older places, but they arehidden. Legend holds that the walls of dark stone were conjured, created,willed into existence by Merlin, when he gathered the most powerful wizards left in the world and awed them into accepting him as their chief.And when (the legend continues) the Seers continued to foretell that notenough had yet been done to prevent the end of the world and its magic,then (the story goes) Merlin sacrificed his life, and his wizardry, and histime, to lay in force the Interdict of Merlin. It was not an act withoutcost, for a place like this one could not be raised again by any power stillknown to wizardkind. Nor yet destroyed, for those walls of dark stonewould pass unharmed, and perhaps unwarmed, through the heart of anuclear explosion. It is a pity that nobody knows how to make them anymore.In the highest of the rising half-circles of the Wizengamot, on the topmost level of dark stone, there is a podium. At that podium stands anold man, with care-lined face and a silver beard that stretches down below his waist; this is Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore. His righthand bears a wand of power, upon his shoulder perches a bird of fire. Hisleft hand holds a short rod, thin and featureless and forged of the samedark stone as the walls, and this is the Line of Merlin Unbroken, the device of the Chief Warlock. Karen Dutton bequeathed the Line to AlbusDumbledore on the last day of her life, scant hours after he returned halfdead from his defeat of Grindelwald with a phoenix flaming brightly athis side. She in turn received the Line from the perfectionist NicodemusCapernaum, each wizard passing it to their chosen successor, back andback in unbroken chain to the day Merlin laid down his life. That (if youwere wondering) is how the country of magical Britain managed to electCornelius Fudge for its Minister, and yet end up with Albus Dumbledorefor its Chief Warlock. Not by law (for written law can be rewritten) but bymost ancient tradition, the Wizengamot does not choose who shall preside over its follies. Since the day of Merlin’s sacrifice, the most important duty of any Chief Warlock has been to exercise the highest cautionin their choice of people who are both good and able to discern good successors. You would expect that chain of light to miss a step, sometimedown through the centuries; that it would go astray at least once, andthen never return. But it has not. The Line of Merlin continues, unbroken.(Or so say those of Dumbledore’s faction. Lord Malfoy would tell youotherwise. And in Asia they tell other tales entirely, which may not makeBritain’s version wrong.)Upon the bottommost platform of the Ancient Hall there is a highbacked chair, legged and armed and without cushions, of dark metalrather than dark stone, which Merlin did not place there.The Ministry building that grew up around this place is wood-paneledand gold-washed, bright and fire-lit, filled with bustling foolishness. Thisplace is different. It is the stone heart of magical Britain, and it is neithergold-washed nor wood-paneled, neither fire-lit nor bright.Filing solemnly into this room are witches and wizards in plumcolored robes each embroidered with a silver W. They carry themselveswith an air of seriousness showing that they are well aware that they areterribly, terribly important. They are meeting in the Most Ancient Hall,after all. They are the Lords and Ladies of the Wizengamot, and they consider themselves the greatest folk of the world’s greatest magical country.Lesser folk have fallen before them on bended knee in supplication; theyare powerful, they are wealthy, they are noble; are they not great?Albus Dumbledore knows everyone in this room by name. He hastaught many of them, though too few have learned. Some are his allies,some his opponents, the rest he courts within the careful dance of theirneutrality. All of them, to him, are people.The current Defense Professor of Hogwarts, if you asked him for hisopinion of the Lords and Ladies, would say that while many of them areambitious, few have any ambition. He would observe that the Wizengamot is exactly where someone like that would end up—that it is exactlythe sort of opportunity you would grasp, if you had nothing better to do.Such folk are rarely interesting, but they are often useful; pieces to be manipulated, points to be scored, by the true players of the game.Not among the rising half-circles, but off to one side among a raisedarc for the spectators, next to a witch in pointed hat whose face is linedwith apprehension, there sits a boy dressed in the most formal blackrobes that he owns. His eyes are green ice and abstraction, and he hardlyglances at the Lords and Ladies as they bustle in. To him they are justa collection of murmuring plum-colored robes to decorate the woodenbenches, visual background for the scene of the Most Ancient Hall. Ifthere is an enemy here, or something to be manipulated, it is merely “theWizengamot”. The wealthy elites of magical Britain have collective force,but not individual agency; their goals are too alien and trivial for themto have personal roles in the tale. As of now, this present time, the boyneither likes nor dislikes the plum-colored robes, because his brain doesnot assign them enough agenthood to be the subjects of moral judgment.He is a PC, and they are wallpaper.This view is about to change.Harry gazed unseeing around the hall of the Wizengamot; it looked quiteold and historic and there was no doubt that Hermione could have lectured him about the place for hours on end. The plum-colored robes hadstopped arriving, and Harry’s pocketwatch, advancing at the rate of threeminutes every half-hour, said that the trial was almost due to start.Professor McGonagall was sitting beside him, and her eyes never lefthim for more than twenty consecutive seconds.Harry had read the Daily Prophet that morning. The headline hadbeen “Mad Muggleborn Tries To End Ancient Line” and the restof the paper had been the same. When Harry was nine years old theIRA had blown up a British barracks, and he’d watched on TV as all thepoliticians contested to see who could be the most loudly outraged. Andthe thought had occurred to Harry—even then, before he’d known muchabout psychology—that it looked like everyone was competing to see whocould be most angry, and nobody would’ve been allowed to suggest thatanyone was being too angry, even if they’d just proposed the saturationnuclear bombing of Ireland. He’d been struck, even then, by an essentialemptiness in the indignation of politicians—though he hadn’t had thewords to describe it, at that age—a sense that they were trying to scorecheap points by hitting at the same safe target as everyone else.Harry had always possessed that sense of hollowness about politicalindignation, but it was strange how very much more obvious it seemed,when you were reading a dozen articles in the Daily Prophet beating onHermione Granger.The leading article, written by some name that Harry didn’t recognize, had called for the minimum age for Azkaban to be lowered, justso that the twisted mudblood who had defaced the honor of Scotlandwith her savage, unprovoked attack upon the last heir of a Most AncientHouse within the sacred refuge of Hogwarts could be sent to the Dementors that were the only punishment commensurate with the severity ofher unspeakable crime. Only this would be enough to discourage anyother foreign, subhuman brutes who similarly believed in their twistedinsanity that they could evade the majesty of the Wizengamot’s inevitableand merciless scourging of all that threatened the honorable nobility ofetcetera etcetera etcetera.The next article had said the same thing in less eloquent words.Earlier, Albus Dumbledore had told him,“I will not try to keep you from this trial.” The old wizard’s voice quiet andunyielding. “I can well foresee how that would go. But I would have you treat mewith equal courtesy in return. The politics of the Wizengamot are delicate, andof them you know nothing. Dare any folly and it shall be to Hermione Granger’scost; and you will remember that folly for the rest of your days, Harry James PotterEvans-Verres.”“I understand,” Harry said. “I know. Just—if you’re planning to pull a rabbitout of your hat and save the day at the last minute when everything seems lost,please tell me now instead of letting me sit and worry—”“I would not do that to you,” the old wizard said, a terrible weariness seemingto suffuse him as he turned to go. “Still less to Hermione. But I have no rabbits inmy hat, Harry. We can only see what Lucius Malfoy wants.”There was a small sharp rap, a single brief sound that somehow silenced the entire room and caused Harry’s head to jerk around and upward. High above, Dumbledore had just tapped his podium with the darkrod he held in his left hand.“The ninetieth session of the two-hundred-and-eighth Wizengamotis convened at the request of Lord Lucius Malfoy,” the old wizard saidtonelessly.At once, far to the side of the podium but also in the highest circle, rosea tall man with a mane of long white spilling down from his head over theshoulders of his plum-colored robes. “I present a witness for questioningunder Veritaserum,” Lucius Malfoy said, his cool tone clear throughoutthe room, smoothly controlled with only a slight undertone of righteousfury. “Let Hermione, the first Granger, be brought forth.”“I ask you all to remember that she is a first-year of Hogwarts,” Dumbledore said. “I will brook no abuse of this witness—”Someone in the benches quite audibly said “Pfah!” and there was aspread of disgusted snorts, even one or two jeers.Harry stared at the plum-colored robes, his eyes narrowing.And with the growing anger came something else, a rising sense ofdisquiet, of something horribly skewed, like reality itself was being disrupted. Harry knew that, somehow, but he couldn’t figure out what wasawry, or why his mind thought it was getting worse…“Order!” Dumbledore bellowed. He rapped the stone rod twice againstthe podium, producing two more small clicks that overrode all noise. “Iwill have order here!”The door through which the witness was brought forth was set directly beneath Harry’s own seat, so it wasn’t until the entire group hademerged fully into the stone hall that Harry saw——an Auror trio——Hermione’s back was to Harry as she was brought out, he couldn’tsee her face——followed by a shining silver sparrow and a running moonlitsquirrel——and the source of the horrible wrongness, half-hidden beneath atattered cloak.Harry shot to his feet before he could even think, it was only Professor McGonagall’s sudden frantic grab on his wrist that stopped his handgoing for his wand; and the Transfiguration Professor whispered desperately, “Harry it’s all right there’s a Patronus—”It took a few seconds for Harry to remember himself. For the part ofhimself that understood that Hermione hadn’t been directly exposed toa Dementor, to argue his other parts into something like sanity—But animal Patronuses aren’t perfect, said another voice inside his mind.Or Dumbledore wouldn’t see the form of a naked man painful to look upon. Youfelt it approaching, animal Patronus or no…Slowly, Harry Potter sat back down again as Professor McGonagallpulled down with her grip on his wrist.But by then he’d already declared war on the country of magicalBritain, and the idea of other people calling him a Dark Lord no longerseemed important one way or another.Hermione’s face became visible to him, as she sat down in the chair.She wasn’t upright and defiant like she’d been in front of Snape, shewasn’t crying like she’d been when the Aurors arrested her. She just satthere with a look of vacant horror as dark metal chains snaked out fromthe chair and bound her arms and legs.Harry couldn’t take it. Without even thinking he was trying to fleeinside himself, flee into his dark side, pull the cold rage over himself like ashield. It took too long, he hadn’t tried to go fully into his dark side sinceAzkaban. And then when his blood was something like cold, he lookedup again, and saw Hermione in the chair again, and discovered that hisdark side knew nothing about how to deal with this type of pain, it piercedthrough the coldness like a knife and didn’t hurt less in the slightest.“Why, if it isn’t Harry Potter!” came a high, light female voice, sicklysweet and indulgent.Slowly, Harry turned his head away from the chair and saw a smilingwoman wearing so much makeup that her skin looked almost pink, sitting next to a man that Harry recognized from photographs as MinisterCornelius Fudge.“Did you have something to say, Mr. Potter?” inquired the woman, ascheerfully as if this wasn’t a trial.Other people were also looking at him now.Harry couldn’t speak, all the words in his mind would have beenstupid to speak aloud. He couldn’t find anything to say that Neville couldalso have said. Dumbledore had warned Harry that if anyone else wantedthe Boy-Who-Lived to speak, he must pretend to be his age—“The Headmaster said I shouldn’t ought to talk,” the boy said, notquite able to keep the edge out of his voice.“Oh, but you have our permission to talk!” the woman said brightly.“I’m sure the Wizengamot is always happy to hear from the Boy-WhoLived!” Beside her, Minister Cornelius Fudge was nodding.The woman’s face was puffy and overweight, visibly pale beneath themakeup. Almost inevitably, a certain word came to mind, and that wordwas toad. Which, said Harry’s logical part, shouldn’t correlate to moralityin any way. Only in Disney movies were ugly people more likely to be eviland vice versa; and those movies were probably scripted by writers who’dnever been ugly. He’d give her a chance, everyone in this room deservedone chance…“Because I got rid of the Dark Lord?” the boy said, and pointed atthe Dementor where it was hovering behind Hermione’s chair. “There’ssomething in this room that’s Darker.”The woman’s face narrowed, growing a little stern. “I realize a youngboy like yourself may be scared by them, Mr. Potter, but the Dementorsare quite obedient to the Ministry of Magic. And they would, of course,be necessary to guard—”“A twelve-year-old girl?” the boy yelled. “Those are the Darkest creatures in the whole world, I could feel it coming here even through thePatronus—the wrongness coming nearer—it’s horribly evil and it—it’d eateveryone in this room, if it could! It shouldn’t be let near any child, ever!Not me, not her, not anyone! You ought to vote to send it away!”“We’ll certainly have no such vote—” the toad-woman snapped.“That’s enough, Madam Umbridge, Mr. Potter,” came Dumbledore’sstern voice from high above. And then after a short pause, the old wizardwent on, “Although, of course, the boy is correct on every count.”Some of the members of the Wizengamot were looking abashed at theBoy-Who-Lived’s admonition, and a few others were nodding violently tothe old wizard’s words. But they were too few. Harry could see it. Theywere too few.The Veritaserum was brought in then, and Hermione looked for abrief moment like she was about to sob, she was looking at Harry—no, atProfessor McGonagall—and Professor McGonagall was mouthing wordsthat Harry couldn’t make out from his angle. Then Hermione swallowedthree drops of Veritaserum and her face grew slack.“Gawain Robards,” said the smooth voice of Lucius Malfoy. “Your probity is known to all of us. If you would do the honors?”One of the three Aurors stepped forward.After the first few questions Harry looked away and stared off to oneside with his fingers in his ears, as Hermione’s brain played back the con* 1302 *tents of the False Memory Charm. He couldn’t handle the drug-dulled anguish in Hermione’s voice as she recounted the false memories, and hisdark side couldn’t handle it either, and he’d already heard the contentssummarized.Harry’s mind flashed back to another day of horror, and even thoughHarry had been on the verge of writing off Lord Voldemort’s continuedexistence as the senility of an old wizard, it suddenly seemed horriblyand uniquely plausible that the entity who’d Memory-Charmed Hermione was the very same mind that had—made use of —Bellatrix Black. Thetwo events had a certain signature in common. To choose that this shouldhappen, plan for this to happen—it would take more than evil, it wouldtake emptiness.Harry looked up for a moment, then, and saw that the plum-coloredrobes were watching, just watching.Some time later, after all the stars in the night sky had gone cold anddark and the last light in the Universe had sputtered down to embers andgone black, the questioning of Hermione ended.“If it pleases my Lords,” said the voice of Lord Malfoy, “I should liketo have the testimony of my son Draco, witnessed under two drops ofVeritaserum, read aloud at this time.”Until she went after me in that battle, I wasn’t plotting anything againstGranger. But after that day I really was feeling insulted, I’d helped her all thosetimes—The sound that came from Hermione’s throat was like she’d just beencrushed under a falling stone, so huge that she couldn’t cry or breathe,just a small sad gasp.“Pardon me,” said one witch from what seemed to be the Malfoyaligned side of the room. “But Lord Malfoy, why would your son help thismudblood girl?”“My son,” Lucius Malfoy said in a heavy voice, “seems to have beenlistening to certain misguided ideas. He is young—and he has learned,now, we have all seen as a country, what such folly brings in repayment.”A few steps down along the visitor’s benches, a man wearing a newsman’s cap and a badge identifying him as belonging to the Daily Prophetwas avidly scribbling with a long quill.The few people who’d nodded along to Dumbledore earlier had rathersick looks on their faces. One witch in plum-colored robes quite deliberately stood up from what had seemed like Dumbledore’s side of the room,and made her way over toward the Malfoy side.The Auror went on reading, his voice monotone.“I’d been so tired from casting all those locking wards, I was weak when I castthe last one. I thought I was stronger than Granger but I wasn’t certain, so I testedit empirically by challenging her to a duel, that’s why I d-d-did it and also becauseif I’d won I was planning to beat her again the next day where everyone could see.Stupid Veritaserum. But she didn’t know about that when she tried to kill me!And I really was insulted by what she’d done, I really had helped her before and Ihadn’t been planning anything against her then, only she went after me in frontof everyone!”When all the witness testimony was done, the deliberations of the Wizengamot began.If you could call them that.It seemed that many members of the Wizengamot were of the strongopinion that murder was bad.The plum-colored robes on Dumbledore’s side of the room weresilent, the supposed forces of good saving their political capital for morewinnable battles. And Harry could hear, as though Professor Quirrellwere standing next to him, a dry voice in his mind; explaining to himthat it would hardly have been to the politicians’ own advantage to speak,just then.But there was one wizard in the room whose status was high enoughthat he had, it seemed, transcended his caution against losing face; onewizard alone whose status was high enough that he could speak a wordof sanity and escape unscathed. He alone spoke to defend Hermione, theman with a phoenix flaming bright upon his shoulder.Only Albus Dumbledore spoke.The Chief Warlock didn’t raise the possibility that Hermione Granger was entirely innocent. That, the Headmaster had explained to Harry,would not be believed, would only make it worse.But Albus Dumbledore said, in one gentle reminder after another,that the perpetrator was a first-year girl in Hogwarts; that many had donefoolish things during their youth; that a first-year in Hogwarts was simply too young to comprehend the consequences of her acts. He himself(the Chief Warlock said quietly) had attempted certain foolish things during his childhood, when he was well older than she.Albus Dumbledore said that Hermione Granger had been belovedof all the Hogwarts faculty, and helped four Hufflepuff girls with theirCharms homework, and had scored one hundred and three points forRavenclaw over the course of the school year.Albus Dumbledore said that nobody who knew Hermione Grangerwould be anything but shocked by these events. That they had, all of them,heard the horror in her voice as she recounted her testimony. And if someunusual madness had temporarily possessed her, then—his voice risingin stern command—she deserved nothing from them except sympathyand a healer’s attentions.And at the last, Albus Dumbledore reminded the Wizengamot, overcries of protest, that the charge was attempted murder and not murder.Albus Dumbledore said, over a rising storm of objections, that no lastingharm had come to anyone. And Albus Dumbledore begged them not todo worse themselves than anything that had yet been done—“Enough!” bellowed Lucius Malfoy, and a show of hands ended the deliberations. The white-maned man stood tall and terrible, his silver caneheld high in one hand like a gavel about to fall. “For what this mad womanhas tried to do to my son—for the blood debt that she owes for trying toend the line of a Noble and Most Ancient House—I say that she will—”“Azkaban!” roared a man with a scarred face, seated at Lord Malfoy’sright hand. “Send the mad mudblood to Azkaban!”“Azkaban!” cried another plum-colored robe, and then another, andanother—A click from the rod in Dumbledore’s hand silenced the room. “Youare out of order,” the old wizard said sternly. “And your proposal is barbaric, beneath the dignity of this assembly. There are things we do notdo. Lord Malfoy?”Lucius Malfoy had listened to this with an impassive face. “Well,”Lord Malfoy said after a few moments. A cold gleam lit his eyes. “I hadnot planned to ask it. But if that is the will of the Wizengamot—then lether pay as any in her place would pay. Let it be Azkaban.”A great cheer of rage went up—“Are you all lost?” cried Albus Dumbledore. “She is too young! Hermind would not withstand it! Not in three centuries has such a thingbeen done in Britain!”“What will the other countries think of us?” said the sharp voice of awoman that Harry recognized as Neville’s grandmother.“Will you guard Azkaban after she goes there, Lord Malfoy?” said astern old witch that Harry didn’t know. “For my Aurors may decline toguard it, I fear, if small children are kept within.”“The deliberations are ended,” Lucius Malfoy said coldly. “But if youare incapable of finding Aurors who can obey the vote of the Wizengamot,Madam Bones, you may relinquish the position; we can easily find another to serve in your place. The will of this Hall is clear. For the monstrosity of her crimes, the girl is to be tried as an adult and punished accordingly; ten years in Azkaban, the justice for attempted murder.”When the old wizard spoke again, his voice was lower. “Is there noalternative to this, Lucius? We may retire to my chambers to discuss it, ifneed be.”The tall man of the long white hair turned, then, to regard where theold wizard stood at the podium; and the two stared at each other for along moment.When Lucius Malfoy spoke again his voice seemed to tremble ever soslightly, as though the stern control on it was failing. “Blood calls for repayment, the blood of my family. Not for any price will I sell the blooddebt owed my son. You would not understand that, who never had loveor child of your own. Still, there is more than one debt owed to HouseMalfoy, and I think that my son, if he stood among us, would rather berepaid for his mother’s blood than for his own. Confess your own crimeto the Wizengamot, as you confessed it to me, and I shall—”“Don’t even think about it, Albus,” said the stern old witch who hadspoken before.The old wizard stood at the podium.The old wizard stood at the podium, his face twisting, untwisting—“Stop it,” said the old witch. “You know the answer you must give,Albus. It will not change for agonizing over it.”The old wizard spoke.“No,” said Albus Dumbledore.“And you, Malfoy,” continued the stern old witch, “I suppose all youreally wanted this whole time was to ruin—”“Hardly,” said Lucius Malfoy, his lips now twisting into a bitter smile.“No, I have no purpose here but my son’s vengeance. I only wished toshow the Wizengamot the truth behind this old man’s pretended heroism and his praise of that girl—that he would hardly think of sacrificinghimself to save her.”“Cruelty worthy of a Death Eater indeed,” said Augusta Longbottom.“Not that I’m implying anything, of course.”“Cruelty?” said Lucius Malfoy, the bitter smile still on his face. “I thinknot. I knew what his answer would be. I have ever warned you that heonly plays his pretended part. If you believe in his hesitation, the morefool you. Remember that his answer was the same.” The man raised hisvoice. “Let us vote, my friends. I think a show of hands will suffice for it.I do not imagine there will be many who choose to align themselves withmurderers.” The voice went cold, on the last note, the promise in it veryclear.“Look at the girl,” said Albus Dumbledore. “See her, see the horror youare committing! She is—” The old wizard’s voice broke. “She is afraid—”The Veritaserum must have been wearing off, because HermioneGranger’s face was twisting beneath the slackness, her limbs tremblingvisibly beneath the chains, as though she were trying to run, run fromthat chair, but was pressed down by weights larger than the enchantedmetal links that bound her. Then there was a convulsive effort and Hermione’s neck moved, her head twisted, enough to bring her eyes intoline—She looked at Harry Potter and though she didn’t speak, it was absolutely clear what she was saying.Harryhelp meplease—And in the Most Ancient Hall of the Wizengamot an icy voice rangout, speech the color of liquid nitrogen, pitched too high for that it camefrom too young a throat, and that voice said, “Lucius Malfoy.”In the ancient and hallowed halls of the Wizengamot, people lookedaround and it took their eyes too long to find what they sought. It mighthave been high in pitch, it might have been under-loud for the wordsbeing spoken; and yet even so, you wouldn’t have expected to hear thatvoice from a child.It wasn’t until Lord Malfoy spoke in return that people even realizedwhere they should be looking.“Harry Potter,” said Lucius Malfoy. He did not incline his head.Heads spun, eyes moved, and people focused on the messy-hairedyoung boy standing near the weeping older witch. The boy stood merelychest-high with his shoes on, dressed in short robes of formal black.Though unless your eyes were keen indeed, you couldn’t have seen, fromall the way across the Hall, that famous and deadly scar beneath hismessy hair.“This folly does not become you, Lucius,” said the boy. “Twelve-yearold girls do not go around committing murders. You are a Slytherin andan intelligent one. You know this is a plot. Hermione Granger was placedon this gameboard by force, by whatever hand lies behind that plot. Youwere surely intended to act just as you are acting now—except that DracoMalfoy was meant to be dead, and you were meant to be beyond all reason. But he is alive and you are sane. Why are you cooperating with yourintended role, in a plot meant to take the life of your son?”A storm seemed to be raging inside Lucius, the face beneath the flowing white hair threatening to crack open and spill something unguessable. The Lord of Malfoy seemed to almost speak once and then twiceagain, swallowing three unheard sentences before his lips parted for true.“A plot, you say?” Lord Malfoy said at last. His face was twitching, hardlycontrolled. “And whose plot would that be, then?”“If I knew,” said the boy, “I would have said so a good deal earlier. Butanyone who had ever been Hermione Granger’s classmate could tell youthat she is a most unlikely murderess. She does, in fact, help Hufflepuffswith their homework. This was not a natural event, Lord Malfoy.”“Plot—or no plot—” Lucius’s voice was trembling. “This mudbloodfilth has touched my son and for that I will end her. You should knowthat full well, Harry Potter.”“It is questionable,” the boy said, “to put it mildly, whether HermioneGranger actually cast that Blood-Cooling Charm. I do not know the exactcircumstances or what spells were involved, but simple trickery wouldnot have sufficed to make her do it. She did not act of her own will, andperhaps did not act at all. Your vengeance is being misdirected, Lord Malfoy, and deliberately so. It is not a twelve-year-old girl who deserves yourire.”“And what do you care for her fate?” Lucius Malfoy’s voice was rising.“What is your stake in this?”“She is my friend,” the boy said, “as Draco is my friend. It is possiblethat this blow was aimed at me, and not at House Malfoy at all.”Again the muscles jumped in Lucius’s face. “And now you are lying tome—as you lied to my son!”“Believe it or not,” the boy said quietly, “I never willed anything butthat Draco should know the truth—”“Enough!” cried the Lord Malfoy. “Enough of your lies! Enough of yourgames! You do not understand—you would never understand—what itmeans that he is my son! I will not be denied this vengeance! No more!Never again! For the blood this girl owes House Malfoy, she shall go toAzkaban. And if I ever find another hand at work—even if it is your own—that hand shall be cut off as well!” Lucius Malfoy raised his deadly silvercane as though in command, his teeth clenched and his lips drawn backin a snarl, like a wolf facing a dragon. “And if you have nothing better tosay than that—be silent, Harry Potter!”Harry’s blood was hammering even beneath the ice of his dark side, thefear for Hermione, the part of him that wanted to lash out at Luciusand destroy him where he stood for his insolence and his stupidity—but Harry didn’t have the power, he didn’t even have a single vote in theWizengamot—Draco had said that Lucius was scared of him, for some unknown reason. And Harry could see it in the rictus that Lord Malfoy’s face had become, drawn and tight, that it was taking all his courage for him to tellHarry to shut up.So Harry said, his voice cool and deadly, hoping to hell that it meantsomething, “You will earn my enmity if you do this thing, Lucius…”Someone in the lower rows of what was evidently the blood-puristside of the Wizengamot, who was looking down at the young boy ratherthan up at Lord Malfoy, laughed in outright incredulity. Other plumcolored robes began to laugh as well.Lord Malfoy gazed at him with hard dignity, as that laughter spread.“If you want the enmity of the House of Malfoy, you shall have it, child.”“Now really,” said the woman in too much pink makeup, “I think thishas gone on quite long enough, wouldn’t you say, Lord Malfoy? The boywill miss his classes.”“Indeed he will,” said Lucius Malfoy, and then raised his voice again.“I call the vote! By show of hands, let the Wizengamot acknowledge theblood debt owed to the Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy, for theattempted murder of its last scion and ending of its line, by Hermione,the first Granger!”Hands shot up one after another, and the secretary who sat in the bottom circle began to make marks on parchment to tally them, but it wasobvious which way the majority had gone.And Harry screamed inside his mind, a frantic call for help to any partof himself that would offer a way out, a strategy, an idea. But there wasnothing, there was nothing, he’d played his last cards and lost. And thenwith a last convulsive desperation Harry plunged himself into his darkside, pushed himself into his dark side, seizing at its deadly clarity, offering his dark side anything if it would only solve this problem for him;and at last the lethal calm came over him, the true ice finally answeringhis call. Beyond all panic and despair his mind began to search throughevery fact in its possession, recall everything it knew about Lucius Malfoy,about the Wizengamot, about the laws of magical Britain; his eyes lookedat the rows of chairs, at every person and every thing within range of hisvision, searching for any opportunity it could grasp—n rising half-circles of dark stone, a great sea of upraised hands.The Lords and Ladies of the Wizengamot, in plum-colored robesmarked with a silver ‘W’, stared down in stern rebuke at a young girl trembling in chains. If they had, in any particular ethical system, damnedthemselves, they clearly thought quite highly of themselves for havingdone so.Harry’s breath was trembling in his chest. His dark side had come upwith a plan—and then rotated itself back out again because speaking tooicily would not be to Hermione’s advantage; a fact which the only-halfcold Harry had somehow not realized…“The vote carries, in favor,” intoned the secretary, when all the tallying was done, and the upraised hands fell back down. “The Wizengamotrecognizes the blood debt owed by Hermione Granger to House Malfoyfor the attempted murder of its scion and ending of its line.”Lucius Malfoy was smiling in grim satisfaction. “And now,” said thewhite-maned wizard, “I say that her debt shall be paid—”Harry clenched his fists beneath the bench and shouted, “By the debtowed from House Malfoy to House Potter!”“Silence!” snapped the woman in too much pink makeup sitting nextto Minister Fudge. “You’ve disrupted these proceedings quite enough already! Aurors, escort him out!”“Wait,” said Augusta Longbottom from the top tier of seats. “Whatdebt is this?”1313 *Lucius’s hands whitened on his cane. “House Malfoy owes no debt toyou!”It wasn’t the world’s most solid hope, it was based on one newspaper article from a woman who’d been False-Memory-Charmed, but RitaSkeeter had seemed to find it plausible, that Mr. Weasley had allegedlyowed James Potter a debt because…“I’m surprised you’ve forgotten,” Harry said evenly. “Surely it was acruel and painful period of your life, laboring under the Imperius curseof He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, until you were freed of it by the effortsof House Potter. By my mother, Lily Potter, who died for it, and by myfather, James Potter, who died for it, and by me, of course.”There was a brief silence within the Most Ancient Hall.“Why, what an excellent point, Mr. Potter,” said the old witch who’dbeen identified as Madam Bones. “I, too, am quite surprised that LordMalfoy would forget such a significant event. It must have been such ahappy day for him.”“Yes,” said Augusta Longbottom. “He must have been so grateful.”Madam Bones nodded. “House Malfoy could not possibly deny thatdebt—unless, perhaps, Lord Malfoy is to tell us that he has misremembered something? I should take quite a professional interest in that. Weare always trying to improve our picture of those dark days.”Lucius Malfoy’s hands gripped the silver snake-handle of his cane likehe was about to strike with it, unleash whatever power it kept—Then the Lord Malfoy seemed to relax, and a chill smile came over hisface. “Of course,” he said easily. “I do confess I had not understood, butthe child is quite correct. But I do not quite think the two debts cancel—House Potter was only trying to save itself, after all—”“Not so,” Dumbledore said from above.“—and therefore,” intoned Lucius Malfoy, “I demand monetary compensation as well, for the redemption of the blood debt owed my son.That, too, is the law.”Harry felt a strange inward flinch. That had also been in the newspaper article, Mr. Weasley had demanded an additional ten thousandGalleons—“How much?” said the Boy-Who-Lived.1314 *Lucius was still wearing the cold smile. “One hundred thousandGalleons. If you have not that much in your vault, I suppose I mustaccept a promissory note for the remainder.”A roar of protest went up from Dumbledore’s side of the room, evensome of the plum-colored robes in the middle looked shocked.“Shall we put it to vote of the Wizengamot?” said Lucius Malfoy. “Ithink few of us would like to see the little murderess go free. By a show ofhands, that additional compensation of one hundred thousand Galleonswould be required to cancel the debt!”The clerk began tallying, but that vote was also clear.Harry stood there, breathing deeply.You’d better not even have to think about this, Harry’s inner Gryffindorsaid threateningly.It’s a major purchase, observed Ravenclaw. We ought to spend a lot of timethinking about it.It shouldn’t have been hard. It shouldn’t have. Two million poundswas only money, and money was only worth what it could buy…It was strange how much psychological attachment you could have to‘only money’, or how painful it could be to imagine losing a bank vault fullof gold that you hadn’t even imagined existed just one year earlier.Kimball Kinnison wouldn’t hesitate, said Gryffindor. Seriously. Like, snapdecision. What sort of hero are you? I already hate you just for having to thinkabout it for longer than 50 milliseconds.This is real life, said Ravenclaw. Losing all your money is a lot more painfulfor real people in real life than in heroic books.What? demanded Gryffindor. Whose side are you on?I wasn’t advocating for a particular answer, said Ravenclaw, I was just saying it because it was true.Could a hundred thousand Galleons be used to save more than one life if spentsome other way? said Slytherin. We have research to do, battles to fight, thedifference between being 40,000 Galleons rich and being 60,000 Galleons in debtis not trivial—So we’ll just use one of our ways to make money fast and earn it all back, saidHufflepuff.1315 *It’s not certain those will work, said Slytherin, and a lot of them require starting cash—Personally, said Gryffindor, I vote that we save Hermione and then gang upand kill our inner Slytherin.The clerk’s voice said that the tally had been recorded and the vote hadpassed…Harry’s lips opened.“I accept your offer,” said Harry’s lips, without any hesitation, withoutany decision having been made; just as if the internal debate had beenpretense and illusion, the true controller of the voice having been no partof it.Lucius Malfoy’s mask of calm shattered, his eyes widened, he staredat Harry in sheer blank astonishment. His mouth had opened slightly,though he wasn’t speaking, and if he was making any peculiar noisesit couldn’t be heard over the roar of simultaneous gasps from theWizengamot—A tap of stone silenced the crowd.“No,” said the voice of Dumbledore.Harry’s head jerked around to stare at the ancient wizard.Dumbledore’s lined face was pale, the silver beard was visibly trembling, he looked like he was in the final throes of a terminal illness. “I’m—sorry, Harry—but this choice is not yours—for I am still the guardian ofyour vault.”“What?” said Harry, too shocked to compose his reply.“I cannot let you go into debt to Lucius Malfoy, Harry! I cannot! Youdo not know—you do not realize—”Harry didn’t even know which part of himself had spoken, it mighthave been a unanimous vote, the pure rage and fury pouring through him.For an instant he thought that the sheer force of the anger might takemagical wing and fly out to strike the Headmaster, send him tumblingback dead from the podium—But when that mental voice had spoken, the old wizard was still standing there, gazing at Harry, long dark wand in his right hand, short blackrod in his left.1316 *And Harry’s eyes also went to the red-golden bird with its claws resting on the shoulder of Dumbledore’s black robes, silent when no phoenixshould have been silent. “Fawkes,” Harry said, his voice sounding strangein his own ears, “can you scream at him for me?”The fiery bird on the old wizard’s shoulder didn’t scream. Maybe theWizengamot had demanded that a spell of silence be put on the creature,otherwise it probably would have been screaming the whole time. ButFawkes hit his master, one golden wing buffeting the old wizard’s head.“I cannot, Harry!” the old wizard said, the agony clear in his voice. “Iam doing as I must do!”And Harry knew, then, as he looked at the red-golden bird, what hehad to do as well. It should have been obvious from the beginning, thatsolution.“Then I too will do what I must,” Harry said up to Dumbledore, asthough the two of them stood alone in the room. “You do realize that,don’t you?”The old wizard shook his trembling head. “You will change your mindwhen you are older—”“I’m not talking about that,” Harry said, his voice still strange in hisown ears. “I mean that I will not allow Hermione Granger to be eatenby Dementors under any circumstances. Period. Regardless of what anylaw says, and no matter what I have to do to stop it. Do I still need to spellit out?”A strange male voice spoke from somewhere far away, “Be sure thatthe girl is taken directly to Azkaban, and put under extra guard.”Harry waited, staring at the old wizard, and then spoke again. “I willgo to Azkaban,” Harry said to the old wizard, as though they stood alonein the world, “before Hermione can be taken there, and start snappingmy fingers. It may cost me my life, but by the time she gets there, therewon’t be an Azkaban anymore.”Some members of the Wizengamot gasped in surprise.Then a greater number started laughing.“How would you even get there, little boy?” someone said, fromamong those who were laughing.1317 *“I have my ways of going places,” said the boy’s distant voice. Harrykept his eyes on Dumbledore, on the old wizard staring at him in shock.Harry didn’t look directly at Fawkes, didn’t give his plan away; but in hismind he prepared to summon the phoenix to transport him, prepared tofill his mind with light and fury, to call for the fire-bird with all his might,he might have to do it upon the instant if Dumbledore pointed his wand—“Would you truly?” the old wizard said to Harry, also as if the two ofthem stood alone in the room.The room went silent again as everyone stared in shock at the ChiefWarlock of the Wizengamot, who seemed to be taking the mad threatcompletely seriously.The old wizard’s eyes were locked only on Harry. “Would you riskeverything—everything—only for her?”“Yes,” Harry said back in reply.That’s the wrong answer, you know, said Slytherin. Seriously.But it’s the true answer.“You will not see reason?” said the old wizard.“Apparently not,” Harry said back.The gazes stayed locked.“This is terrible folly,” said the old wizard.“I am aware of this,” answered the hero. “Now get out of my way.”Strange light glinted in the ancient blue eyes. “As you will, Harry Potter, but know that this is not over.”The rest of the world faded back into existence.“I withdraw my objection,” said the old wizard, “Harry Potter may doas he wishes,” and the Wizengamot exploded in a roar of shock, only tobe silenced by a final tap of the stone rod.Harry turned his head back to look at Lord Malfoy, who looked likehe’d seen a cat turn into a person and start eating other cats. To call thelook confused did not begin to describe it.“You would truly…” Lucius Malfoy said slowly. “You would truly pay ahundred thousand Galleons, to save one mudblood girl.”“I think there’s about forty thousand in my Gringotts vault,” Harrysaid. It was strange how that was still causing more internal pain than the1318 *thought of taking an over-fifty-percent risk to his life to destroy Azkaban.“As for the other sixty thousand—what are the rules, exactly?”“It comes due when you graduate Hogwarts,” the old wizard said fromhigh above. “But Lord Malfoy has certain rights over you before then, Ifear.”Lucius Malfoy stood motionless, frowning down at Harry. “Who isshe to you, then? What is she to you, that you would pay so much to keepher from harm?”“My friend,” the boy said quietly.Lucius Malfoy’s eyes narrowed. “By the report I received, you cannotcast the Patronus Charm, and Dumbledore knows this. The power of asingle Dementor nearly killed you. You would not dare venture near Azkaban in your own person—”“That was in January,” said Harry. “This is April.”Lucius Malfoy’s eyes remained cool and calculating. “You pretend youcan destroy Azkaban, and Dumbledore pretends to believe it.”Harry did not reply.The white-haired man turned slightly, toward the center of the halfcircle, as though to address the greater Wizengamot. “I withdraw my offer!” shouted the Lord of Malfoy. “I will not accept the debt to HousePotter in payment, not even for a hundred thousand Galleons! The girl’sblood debt to House Malfoy stands!”Again the roar of many voices. “Dishonorable!” someone cried. “Youacknowledge the debt to House Potter, and yet you would—” and thenthat voice cut off.“I acknowledge the debt, but the law does not strictly oblige me toaccept it in cancellation,” said Lord Malfoy with a grim smile. “The girl isno part of House Potter; the debt I owe House Potter is no debt to her. Asfor the dishonor—” Lucius Malfoy paused. “As for the grave shame I feelat my ingratitude toward the Potters, who have done so much for me—”Lucius Malfoy bowed his head. “May my ancestors forgive me.”“Well, boy?” called the scarred man sitting at Lord Malfoy’s right hand.“Go and destroy Azkaban, then!”“I’d like to see that,” said another voice. “Will you be selling tickets?”1319 *It went without saying that Harry didn’t pick this particular momentto give up.The girl is no part of House Potter—He had, in fact, seen the obvious way out of the dilemma almost instantly.It might have taken him longer if he hadn’t recently overheard a number of conversations between older Ravenclaw girls, and read a certainnumber of Quibbler stories.He was, nonetheless, having trouble accepting it.This is ridiculous, said a part of Harry which had just dubbed itself theInternal Consistency Checker. Our actions here are completely incoherent.First you feel less emotional reluctance to risk your bloody LIFE and probably DIEfor Hermione, than to part with a stupid heap of gold. And now you’re balking justat getting married?You know what? said Internal Consistency Checker. You’re stupid.I didn’t say no, thought Harry. I was just saying SYSTEM ERROR.I vote for destroying Azkaban, said Gryffindor. It needs to be done anyway.Really, really stupid, said Internal Consistency Checker. Oh, screw this,I’m assuming control of our body.The boy took a deep breath, and opened his mouth—By this point Harry Potter had entirely forgotten the existence of Professor McGonagall, who had been sitting there this whole time undergoing a number of interesting changes of facial expression which Harry hadnot been looking at because he was distracted. It would have been overlyharsh to say that Harry had forgotten her because he did not consider hera PC. It could be more kindly said that Professor McGonagall was not visibly a solution to any of his current problems, and therefore she was notpart of the universe.So Harry, who at this point had a fair amount of adrenaline in hisbloodstream, startled and jumped quite visibly when Professor McGonagall, her eyes now blazing with impossible hope and the tears on her cheekhalf-dried, leapt to her feet and cried, “With me, Mr. Potter!” and, withoutwaiting for a reply, tore down the stairs that led to the bottom platformwhere waited a chair of dark metal.It took a moment, but Harry ran after; though it took him longer toreach the bottom, after Professor McGonagall vaulted half the stairs witha strange catlike motion and landed with the astonished-looking Aurortrio already pointing their wands at her.“Miss Granger!” cried Professor McGonagall. “Can you speak yet?”Much as with Professor McGonagall, there was a certain sense inwhich it could be said that Harry had forgotten about the existence ofHermione Granger, because Harry had been tilting his neck back to lookupward rather than downward, and because he hadn’t considered her asolution to any of his current problems. Though it was hardly certain, infact it wasn’t at all probable, that Harry remembering to look at Hermione or think about what she must be feeling, would have helped anythingin the slightest.Harry reached the bottom of the stairs and saw Hermione Grangerfull on—Without thinking, without being able to help himself, Harry shut hiseyes, but he’d seen.Her school robes around her neck, soaked all the way through withtears.The way she’d been looking away from him.And the eye of memory and sympathy, which could not be shut, whichcould not look away, knew that Hermione had recounted the worst shameof her life in front of the nobility of magical Britain and Professor McGonagall and Dumbledore and Harry; and then been sentenced to Azkabanwhere she would be exposed to darkness and cold and all her worst memories until she went mad and died; and then she’d heard that Harry wasgoing to give away all his money and go into debt to save her, and maybeeven sacrifice his lifeand with the Dementor standing only a few paces behind hershe hadn’t said anything…“Y-yes,” whispered the voice of Hermione Granger. “I c-can talk.”Harry opened his eyes again and saw her face, now looking at him.It didn’t say anything like what he thought Hermione was feeling, facescouldn’t say anything that complicated, all facial muscles could do wascontort themselves into knots.1321 *“H-H-Harry, I-I’m so, I’m so—”“Shut up,” Harry suggested.“s-s-sorry—”“If you’d never met me on the train you wouldn’t be in any troubleright now. So shut up,” said Harry Potter.“Both of you stop being silly,” Professor McGonagall said in her firmScottish accent (it was strange how much that helped). “Mr. Potter, holdout your wand so that Miss Granger’s fingers can touch it. Miss Granger,repeat after me. Upon my life and magic—”Harry did as he was bid, thrusting his wand forward to touch Hermione’s fingers; and then Hermione’s faltering voice said, “Upon my lifeand magic—”“I swear service to the House of Potter—” said Professor McGonagall.And Hermione, without waiting for any further instructions, said, thewords spilling out of her in a rush, “I swear service to the House of Potter,to obey its Master or Mistress, and stand at their right hand, and fight attheir command, and follow where they go, until the day I die.”All those words had been blurted out in a desperate gasp before Harrycould have thought or said anything, if he’d been mad enough to interrupt.“Mr. Potter, repeat these words,” said Professor McGonagall. “I,Harry, heir and last scion of the Potters, accept your service, until theend of the world and its magic.”Harry took a breath and said, “I, Harry, heir and last scion of the Potters, accept your service, until the end of the world and its magic.”“That’s it,” said Professor McGonagall. “Well done.”Harry looked up, and saw that the entire Wizengamot, whose existence he’d forgotten, was staring at them.And then Minerva McGonagall, who was Head of House Gryffindoreven if she didn’t always act like it, looked up high above at where LuciusMalfoy stood; and she said to him before the entire Wizengamot, “I regretevery point I ever gave you in Transfiguration, you vile little worm.”Whatever Lucius was about to say in reply was silenced by a tap ofthe short rod in Dumbledore’s hand. “Ahem!” said the old wizard fromhis podium of dark stone. “This session has carried on quite considerably,and if it is not dismissed soon, some of us may miss their entire luncheon.The law of this matter is clear. You have already voted on the terms ofthe bargain, and Lord Malfoy cannot legally decline it. As we have farexceeded our allotted time, I now, in accordance with the last decision ofthe survivors of the eighty-eighth Wizengamot, adjourn this session.”The old wizard tapped the rod of dark stone three times.“You fools!” shouted Lucius Malfoy. The white hair was shaking asthough in a wind, the face beneath was pale with fury. “Do you think you’llget away with what you’ve done today? Do you think that girl can try tomurder my son and escape unscathed?”The toad-like pink-makeup woman, whose name Harry could nolonger remember, was standing up from her seat. “Why, of course not,”she said with a sickening smile. “After all, the girl is still a murderess, andI think the Ministry shall be watching her affairs quite closely—it hardlyseems wise that she should be allowed to wander the streets, after all—”Harry was fed up at this point.Without waiting to listen, Harry turned on his heel and strode forward in long steps toward—The horror only he could truly see, the absence of color and space, thewound in the world, above which floated a tattered cloak; most imperfectly guarded by a running moonlit squirrel and fluttering silver sparrow.His dark side had also noticed, when it was looking through the entireroom for anything that could possibly be used as a weapon, that the enemy had been foolish enough to bring a Dementor into Harry’s presence.That was a powerful weapon indeed, and one that Harry might wield better than its supposed masters. There had been a time in Azkaban whenHarry had told twelve Dementors to turn and go, and they had gone.The Dementors are Death, and the Patronus Charm works by thinking abouthappy thoughts instead of Death.If Harry’s theory was correct, that one sentence would be all it tookto pop the Aurors’ Patronus Charms like a soap bubble, and ensure thatnobody within reach of his voice could cast another one.I am going to cancel the Patronus Charms and prevent any more Patronusesfrom being cast. And then my Dementor, flying faster than any broomstick, isgoing to Kiss everyone here who voted to send a twelve-year-old girl to Azkaban.Say that, to set up the if-then expectation, and wait for people to understand and laugh. Then speak the fatal truth; and when the Aurors’Patronuses winked out to prove the point, either people’s anticipations ofthe mindless void, or Harry’s threat of its destruction, would make theDementor obey. Those who had sought to compromise with the darknesswould be consumed by it.It was the other solution his dark side had devised.Ignoring the gasps rising from behind him, Harry crossed the radiusof the Patronuses, strode to a single pace from Death. Its unhinderedfear burst around him like a whirlpool, like stepping next to the suckingdrain of some huge bathtub emptying out its water; but with the false Patronuses no longer obscuring the level on which they interacted, Harrycould reach the Dementor even as it could reach him. Harry lookedstraight into the pulling vacuum and—the Earth among the starsall his triumph at saving Hermionesomeday the reality of which you are a shadow will cease to existHarry took all the silver emotion that fueled his Patronus Charm andshoved it at the Dementor; and expected Death’s shadow to flee fromhim——and as Harry did that, he flung his hands up and shouted “BOO!”The void retreated sharply away from Harry until it came up againstthe dark stone behind.In the hall there was a deathly silence.Harry turned his back on the empty void, and looked up at where thetoad-woman stood. She was pale beneath the pink makeup, her mouthopening and closing like a fish.“I make you this one offer,” said the Boy-Who-Lived. “I never learnthat you’ve been interfering with me or any of mine. And you never findout why the unkillable soul-eating monster is scared of me. Now sit downand shut up.”The toad-woman fell back down to her bench without a word.Harry looked further up.“A riddle, Lord Malfoy!” the Boy-Who-Lived shouted across the MostAncient Hall. “I know you weren’t in Ravenclaw, but try to answer thisone anyway! What destroys Dark Lords, frightens Dementors, and owesyou sixty thousand Galleons?”For an instant Lord Malfoy stood there with eyes slightly widened;then his face fell back into calm scorn, and his voice spoke coolly in reply. “Are you openly threatening me, Mr. Potter?”“I’m not threatening you,” said the Boy-Who-Lived. “I’m scaring you.There’s a difference.”“Enough, Mr. Potter,” said Professor McGonagall. “We shall be latefor afternoon Transfiguration as it is. And do come back here, you’re stillterrifying that poor Dementor.” She turned to the Aurors. “Mr. Kleiner,if you would!”Harry strode back to them, as the Auror addressed moved forwardand pressed a short rod of dark metal to the dark metal chair, mutteringan inaudible word of dismissal.The chains slithered back as smoothly as they had come forth; andHermione pushed herself out of the chair as fast as she could, and halfran and half-staggered forward a few steps.Harry held out his arms——and Hermione half-jumped half-fell into Professor McGonagall’sarms, beginning to sob hysterically.Hmpfh, said a voice inside Harry. I kind of thought we’d earned that oneourselves.Oh, shut up.Professor McGonagall was holding Hermione so firmly that youmight have thought it was a mother holding her daughter, or maybegranddaughter. After a few moments Hermione’s sobs slowed, and thenstopped. Professor McGonagall suddenly shifted her stance and grabbedonto her more tightly; the girl’s hands were dangling limply, now, andher eyes were closed—“She’ll be fine, Mr. Potter,” Professor McGonagall said softly inHarry’s direction, without looking at him. “She just needs a few hours inone of Madam Pomfrey’s beds.”“All right, then,” Harry said. “Let’s get her to Madam Pomfrey’s.”“Yes,” said Dumbledore, as he descended to the bottom of the darkstone stairs. “Let us all go home, indeed.” His blue eyes were locked onHarry, as hard as sapphires.The Lords and Ladies of the Wizengamot are departing their woodenbenches, leaving as they came, looking rather nervous.The vast majority are thinking ‘The Dementor was frightened of theBoy-Who-Lived!’Some of the shrewder ones are already wondering how this will affect the delicate power balance of the Wizengamot—if a new piece hasappeared upon the gameboard.Almost none are thinking anything along the lines of ‘I wonder howhe did that.’This is the truth of the Wizengamot: Many are nobles, many arewealthy magnates of business, a few came by their status in other ways.Some of them are stupid. Most are shrewd in the realms of businessand politics, but their shrewdness is circumscribed. Almost none havewalked the path of a powerful wizard. They have not read through ancient books, scrutinized old scrolls, searching for truths too powerfulto walk openly and disguised in conundrums, hunting for true magicamong a hundred fantastic fairy tales. When they are not looking at acontract of debt, they abandon what shrewdness they possess and relaxwith some comfortable nonsense. They believe in the Deathly Hallows,but they also believe that Merlin fought the dread Totoro and imprisonedthe Ree. They know (because that too is part of the standard legend) thata powerful wizard must learn to distinguish the truth among a hundredplausible lies. But it has not occurred to them that they might do thesame.(Why not? Why, indeed, would wizards with enough status andwealth to turn their hands to almost any endeavor, choose to spendtheir lives fighting over lucrative monopolies on ink importation? TheHeadmaster of Hogwarts would hardly see the question; of course mostpeople should not be powerful wizards, just as most people should notbe heroes. The Defense Professor could explain at great and cynicallength why their ambitions are so trivial; to him, too, there is no puzzle.Only Harry Potter, for all the books he has read, is unable to understand;to the Boy-Who-Lived the life choices of the Lords and Ladies seemincomprehensible—not what a good person would do, nor yet an evilperson either. Now which of the three is most wise?)For whatever reason, then, most of the Wizengamot has never walkedthe path that leads to powerful wizardry; they do not seek out what ishidden. For them, there is no why. There is no explanation. There is nocausality. The Boy-Who-Lived, who was already halfway into the magisterium of legend, has now been promoted all the way there; and it isa brute fact, simple and unexplained, that the Boy-Who-Lived frightensDementors. Ten years earlier they were told that a one-year-old boy defeated the most terrible Dark Lord of their generation, perhaps the mostevil Dark Lord ever to live; and they just accepted that too.You are not meant to question that sort of thing (they know in someunspoken way). If the most terrible Dark Lord in history, confronts aninnocent baby—why, how could he not be vanquished? The rhythm ofthe play demands it. You are supposed to applaud, not stand up fromyour seat in the audience and say ‘Why?’ It is just the story’s conceit, thatin the end the Dark Lord is brought down by a little child; and if you aregoing to question that, you might as well not attend the play in the firstplace.It does not occur to them to second-guess the application of such reasoning to the events they have seen with their own eyes in the Most Ancient Hall. Indeed, they are not consciously aware that they are usingstory-reasoning on real life. As for scrutinizing the Boy-Who-Lived withthe same careful logic they would use on a political alliance or a businessarrangement—what brain would associate to that, when a part of the legendary magisterium is at hand?But there are a very few, seated on those wooden benches, who do notthink like this.There are a certain few of the Wizengamot who have read throughhalf-disintegrated scrolls and listened to tales of things that happened tosomeone’s brother’s cousin, not for entertainment, but as part of a questfor power and truth. They have already marked the Night of Godric’s Hollow, as reported by Albus Dumbledore, as an anomalous and potentiallyimportant event. They have wondered why it happened, if it did happen;or if not, why Dumbledore is lying.And when an eleven-year-old boy rises up and says “Lucius Malfoy” inthat cold adult voice, and goes on to speak words one simply would notexpect to hear from a first-year in Hogwarts, they do not allow the fact toslip into the lawless blurs of legends and the premises of plays.They mark it as a clue.They add it to the list.This list is beginning to look somewhat alarming.It doesn’t particularly help when the boy yells “BOO!” at a Dementorand the decaying corpse presses itself flat against the opposite wall andits horrible ear-hurting voice rasps, “Make him go away.”hoenix travel was a sensation entirely unlike Apparition or portkeys.You caught on fire—you definitely felt yourself catching on fire,even though there was no pain—and instead of burning to ashes, the fireburned all the way through you and you became fire, and then you wentout in one place and blazed up in another. It didn’t sicken the stomachlike portkeys or Apparition, but it was a rather unnerving experiencenonetheless. If the underlying truth of phoenix travel really was becoming a specific instantiation of a more general Fire, then that seemed tohint you could potentially burn anywhere— even in the distant past, or inanother universe, or in two places at once. You might go out in one placeand blaze up in a hundred others, and the you who arrived at Hogwartswould never know the difference. Though Harry had read what he couldabout phoenixes, trying to figure out how to get one of his own, andthere’d been no hint of anything remotely like that capability.Harry caught fire and went out and blazed up somewhere else; andjust like that he, and the Headmaster, and the unconscious form of Hermione Granger held in the Headmaster’s arms, were occupying anotherplace; with Fawkes above them all. A calm, warm room of bright stonecolumns, skylit on all four sides, populated by white beds in long rows,four of which had silencing veils drawn around them, and the rest empty.In one corner of Harry’s vision, a surprised-looking Madam Pomfreywas turning toward them. Dumbledore seemed to pay the senior healerno heed, as he carefully laid down Hermione on an unoccupied white bed.From a distant corner there was a flash of green, and from out of afireplace strode Professor McGonagall, brushing herself off slightly fromthe Floo ashes.The old wizard turned from the bed and reached one of his armsaround Harry again; and then the Boy-Who-Lived and his wizard vanished in another burst of fire.When Harry had fully lit up again he was standing in the Headmaster’soffice, amid the noises of a dozen dozen inexplicable gidgets.The young boy took a step away from the old wizard and then turnedon him, emerald and sapphire eyes meeting.The two of them did not speak for a time, looking at each other; asthough all they had to speak could be said only by stares, and not said inany other way.In time the boy enunciated words slowly and precisely.“I cannot believe that a phoenix is still upon your shoulder.”“The phoenix chooses but once,” said the old wizard. “They might perhaps leave a master who chooses evil over good; they will not leave a master forced to choose between one good and another. Phoenixes are notarrogant. They know the limits of their own wisdom.” Stern indeed, thatancient gaze. “Unlike you, Harry.”“Choose between one good and another,” Harry echoed flatly. “LikeHermione Granger’s life, versus a hundred thousand Galleons.” The rageand indignation Harry wanted to put into his voice wasn’t quite there, forsome reason, maybe because—“You are hardly in a position to speak to me of that, Harry Potter.”The Headmaster’s voice was deceptively soft. “Or what was that look ofreluctance that I saw upon your face, there in the Most Ancient Hall?”The sense of inward hollowness grew worse. “I was looking for otheralternatives,” Harry bit out. “Some way to save her that didn’t lose themoney.”Wow, said Ravenclaw. You just told an outright lie. Not only that, I thinkyou actually believed it for the seconds it took to say it. That’s kinda scary.“Is that what you were thinking, Harry?” The blue eyes were keen, andthere was a terrifying moment when Harry wondered if the world’s mostpowerful wizard could see right past his Occlumency barriers.“Yes,” Harry said, “I flinched away from the pain of losing all themoney in my vault. But I did it! That’s what counts! And you—” Theindignation that had faltered out of Harry’s voice returned. “You actuallyput a price on Hermione Granger’s life, and you put it below a hundredthousand Galleons!”“Oh?” the old wizard said softly. “And what price do you put on herlife, then? A million Galleons?”“Are you familiar with the economic concept of ‘replacement value’?”The words were spilling from Harry’s lips almost faster than he could consider them. “Hermione’s replacement value is infinite! There’s nowhere Ican go to buy another one!”Now you’re just talking mathematical nonsense, said Slytherin. Ravenclaw,back me up here?“Is Minerva’s life also of infinite worth?” the old wizard said harshly.“Would you sacrifice Minerva to save Hermione?”“Yes and yes,” Harry snapped. “That’s part of Professor McGonagall’sjob and she knows it.”“Then Minerva’s value is not infinite,” said the old wizard, “for all thatshe is loved. There can only be one king upon a chessboard, Harry Potter,only one piece that you will sacrifice any other piece to save. And Hermione Granger is not that piece. Make no mistake, Harry Potter, this dayyou may well have lost your war.”And if the old wizard’s words hadn’t hit quite so hard, and quite soclose to home, Harry might not have said what he said then.“Lucius was right,” Harry ground out. “You never had a wife, younever had a daughter, you’ve never had anything but war—”The old wizard’s left hand closed hard upon Harry’s wrist, bony fingers digging into the still-developing muscle of Harry’s arm, and for amoment Harry was paralyzed with the shock of it, he had forgotten whatit meant that adults were stronger.1331 *Albus Dumbledore did not seem to notice. He only turned, draggingHarry with him, and moved forward in hard steps toward the wall of theroom.“Phoenix’s price.”Harry was pulled up along the black stairs.“Phoenix’s fate.”The room of black pedestals, silver light falling on shattered wands.“You think,” yelled Harry, after his lips unlocked, “that you can winany argument, just by standing here?”The old wizard ignored him, dragging Harry across the room. Hisright hand, no longer holding his wand, grabbed up a vial of silver fluid—Harry blinked in shock; the vial of silver fluid had been standing nextto a picture of Dumbledore, or so it had appeared to Harry in the brief moment before he was dragged past.Past the end of all the pedestals, at the farthest part of the room, rosea great stone basin with runes carved into it that Harry didn’t recognize.The center was a shallow depression filled with transparent liquid, andinto this the old wizard dumped the canister of silver fluid, which at oncebegan to spread out, to swirl, to set the entire basin glowing eerie white.The old wizard’s hand let go of Harry’s arm and gestured to the glowing basin, commanding harshly, “Look!”As requested, Harry stared at the glowing water.“Put your head into the Pensieve, Harry Potter.” The old wizard’svoice was stern.Harry had heard that word before, but he couldn’t remember where .“What—does this do—”“Memories,” the old wizard said. “You will see my memory. My oaththat it is safe. Now look into the Pensieve, Ravenclaw, if you still careanything at all for your precious truth!”That was a request that Harry could not deny, and he stepped forwardand thrust his head into the glowing water.Harry was sitting behind the desk in the Headmaster’s office of Hogwarts, and hiswrinkled hands that clutched at his head were spotted with age and white hairs.“He is all that I have!” wept a voice, very strange was Dumbledore’s voice asDumbledore himself remembered it, from the inside it seemed far less stern andwise. “The last of my family! All that I have left!”No emotion had been allowed to pass through the Pensieve, only the physical sensation of seeming to speak the words. Harry heard the utter desolation inDumbledore’s words, the sounds that seemed to come from Harry’s own throat,but Harry did not feel it beyond the hearing.“You’ve got no choice,” said a harsh voice.The eyes moved, the field of vision jumped to a man that Harry didn’t recognize, in clothing tinged with Auror crimson but made of solid leather with manypockets.His right eye was overlarge, with an electric-blue pupil that constantly dartedand moved.“You cannot ask this of me, Alastor!” Dumbledore’s voice was wild. “Not this!Anything but this!”“I’m not asking,” growled the man. “Voldie’s the one who’s asking, and you’regoing to tell him no.”“For money, Alastor?” Dumbledore’s voice was begging. “Only for money?”“You ransom Aberforth, you lose the war,” the man said sharply. “That simple.One hundred thousand Galleons is nearly all we’ve got in the war-chest, and if youuse it like this, it won’t be refilled. What’ll you do, try to convince the Potters toempty their vault like the Longbottoms already did? Voldie’s just going to kidnapsomeone else and make another demand. Alice, Minerva, anyone you care about,they’ll all be targets if you pay off the Death Eaters. That’s not the lesson youshould be trying to teach them.”“If I do this I will have no one. No one.” Dumbledore’s voice broke, the worldtilted as the outlooking head fell down into the ancient hands, and awful soundscame from not-Harry’s throat as he began to sob like a child.“Shall I tell Voldie’s messenger no?” said Alastor’s voice, now strangely gentle.“You don’t have to do it yourself, old friend.”“No—I will say it myself—I must—”The memory ended with a shock and Harry ripped his head out of theglowing water, gasping as though he’d been deprived of air.The transition between scenes, between decade-old reality andpresent moment, was another jolt to Harry’s mind; in some fashionhis immersion in the past had unanchored him. The broken old mansobbing in his office had been another person in another era, Harry hadunderstood that much; someone softer—Before it had all vanished like dissipating smoke, returning the now,the present day.Terrible and stern stood the ancient wizard, like he was carven fromstone; beard woven of thread like iron, half-moon glasses like mirrors,and the pupils behind as sharp and unyielding as black diamond.“Do you also wish to see my brother as he died under the Cruciatus?”said Albus Dumbledore. “Voldemort sent me that memory as well!”“And that—” Harry was having trouble producing a voice, for thegrowing sickness in his chest. “That was when—” The words seemed toburn in his throat, as the awful knowledge dawned on him, the horribleunderstanding. “That was when you burned Narcissa Malfoy alive in herown bedroom.”Albus Dumbledore’s gaze was cold as he answered. “To that questiononly a fool would say yea or nay. What matters is that the Death Eatersbelieve I killed her, and that belief kept safe the families of all who servedthe Order of the Phoenix—until this day. Now do you understand whatyou have done? What you have done to your friends, Harry Potter, andto any that stand with you?” The old wizard seemed to grow still tallerand more terrible, as his voice rose louder. “You have made them all targets, and targets they will remain! Until you prove, the only way it can beproven, that you are no longer willing to pay such prices!”“And is it true?” Harry said. There was a buzzing sensation filling him,his body growing more distant. “What Draco said, that Narcissa Malfoynever got her hands dirty, that she was only Lucius’s wife? She was anenabler, I get that, but I can’t back that deserving being burned alive.”“Nothing less would have convinced them that I was done with hesita* 1334 *tion.” The old wizard’s voice brooked no question and no refusal. “AlwaysI was too reluctant to do as I must, always it was others who paid the costof my mercy. So Alastor told me from the beginning, but I did not listento him. You, I expect, shall prove better at such decisions than I.”“I’m surprised,” Harry said, amazed that his voice was almost steady.“I would have expected the Death Eaters to go after another Light familyand start a cycle of escalating retaliation, if you didn’t get them all withyour first strike.”“If my opponent had been Lucius, perhaps.” Dumbledore’s eyeswere like stones. “I am told that Voldemort laughed at the news, andproclaimed to his Death Eaters that I had finally grown, and was at last aworthy opponent. Perhaps he was right. After the day I condemned mybrother to his death, I began to weigh those who followed me, balancingthem one against another, asking who I would risk, and who I wouldsacrifice, to what end. It was strange how many fewer pieces I lost, onceI knew what they were worth.”Harry’s jaw seemed locked, like it took a massive effort to make hislips move. “But then it’s not like Lucius was deliberately taking Hermionefor ransom,” Harry’s voice said thinly. “From Lucius’s perspective, someone else broke the truce first. So with that in mind, how many Galleonswas Hermione worth, exactly? Leaving aside the Danegeld thing, if it wasjust some ordinary threat to her life, how much should I have paid to saveher? Ten thousand Galleons? Five thousand?”The old wizard did not answer.“It’s a funny thing,” Harry said, his voice wavering like somethingseen through water. “Do you know, the day I went in front of the Dementor, what my worst memory was? It was my parents dying. I heard theirvoices and everything.”The old wizard’s eyes widened behind the half-moon glasses.“And here’s the thing,” Harry said, “here’s the thing I’ve been thinkingabout over and over. The Dark Lord gave Lily Potter the chance to walkaway. He said that she could flee. He told her that dying in front of the cribwouldn’t save her baby. ‘Step aside, foolish woman, if you have any sensein you at all—’” An awful chill came over Harry as he spoke those wordsfrom his own lips, but he shook it off and continued. “And afterward Ikept thinking, I couldn’t seem to stop myself from thinking, wasn’t theDark Lord right? If only Mother had stepped away. She tried to curse theDark Lord but it was suicide, she had to have known that it was suicide.Her choice wasn’t between her life and mine, her choice was for herself tolive or for both of us to die! If she’d only done the logical thing and walkedaway, I mean, I love Mum too, but Lily Potter would be alive right now andshe would be my mother!” Tears were blurring Harry’s eyes. “Only now Iunderstand, I know what Mother must have felt. She couldn’t step asidefrom the crib. She couldn’t! Love doesn’t walk away!”It was like the old wizard had been struck, struck by a chisel that shattered him straight down the middle.“What have I said?” the old wizard whispered. “What have I said toyou?”“I don’t know!” shouted Harry. “I wasn’t listening either!”“I—I’m sorry, Harry—I—” The old wizard pressed his hands to hisface, and Harry saw that Albus Dumbledore was weeping. “I shouldnot have said, such things to you—I should not, have resented, yourinnocence—”Harry stared at the wizard for another second, and then Harry turnedand marched out of the black room, down the stairs, through the office—“I really don’t know why you’re still on his shoulder,” Harry said toFawkes.—out the oaken door and into the endlessly turning spiral.Harry had arrived in the Transfiguration classroom before anyone else,before even Professor McGonagall. There was Charms class earlier, forhis year, but that he hadn’t even bothered trying to attend. Whether Professor McGonagall would make today’s class he didn’t know. There wassomething ominous about all the empty desks beside him, the absence atthe board. As if he stood alone in Hogwarts, with all his friends departed.According to the class schedule, today’s lesson was on sustainedTransfigurations, all the rules of which Harry had learned by heart backwhen he was Transfiguring a huge rock into the small diamond thatshone on his pinky finger. It would be a theoretical subject, rather thanpractical, for the rest of the class; which was a pity, because he could haveused a dose of Transfiguration’s trance.Harry noted distantly that his hand was trembling, to the pointwhere he had trouble undoing the pouch’s drawstring as he drew forththe Transfiguration textbook.You were monstrously unfair to Dumbledore, said the voice Harry hadbeen calling Slytherin, only now it also seemed to be the Voice of Economic Sensibility and maybe also Conscience.Harry’s eyes dropped down to his textbook, but the section was so familiar it might as well have been a blank parchment.Dumbledore fought a war against a Dark Lord who deliberately set out tobreak him in the cruelest possible way. He had to choose between losing his warand his brother. Albus Dumbledore knows, he learned in the worst possible way,that there are limits to the value of one life; and it almost broke his sanity to admitit. But you, Harry Potter— you already knew better.“Shut up,” the boy whispered to the empty Transfiguration classroom,though there was nobody there to hear it.You’d already read about Philip Tetlock’s experiments on people asked to tradeoff a sacred value against a secular one, like a hospital administrator who hasto choose between spending a million dollars on a liver to save a five-year-old,and spending the million dollars to buy other hospital equipment or pay physician salaries. And the subjects in the experiment became indignant and wantedto punish the hospital administrator for even thinking about the choice. Do youremember reading about that, Harry Potter? Do you remember thinking how verystupid that was, since if hospital equipment and doctor salaries didn’t also savelives, there would be no point in having hospitals or doctors? Should the hospital administrator have paid a billion pounds for that liver, even if it meant thehospital going bankrupt the next day?“Shut up!” the boy whispered.Every time you spend money in order to save a life with some probability, youestablish a lower bound on the monetary value of a life. Every time you refuse tospend money to save a life with some probability, you establish an upper boundon the monetary value of life. If your upper bounds and lower bounds are incon* 1337 *sistent, it means you could move money from one place to another, and save morelives at the same cost. So if you want to use a bounded amount of money to save asmany lives as possible, your choices must be consistent with some monetary valueassigned to a human life; if not then you could reshuffle the same money and dobetter. How very sad, how very hollow the indignation, of those who refuse to saythat money and life can ever be compared, when all they’re doing is forbidding thestrategy that saves the most people, for the sake of pretentious moral grandstanding…You knew that, and you still said what you did to Dumbledore.You deliberately tried to hurt Dumbledore’s feelings.He’s never tried to hurt you, Harry Potter, not once.Harry’s head dropped into his hands.Why had Harry said what he’d said, to a sad old ancient wizard who’dfought hard and endured more than anyone should ever have to endure?Even if the old wizard was wrong, did he deserve to be hurt for it, afterall that had happened to him? Why was there a part of him that seemedto get angry at the old wizard beyond reason, lashing out at him harderthan Harry had ever hit anyone, without thought of moderation once therage had been raised, only to quiet as soon as Harry left his presence?Is it because you know Dumbledore won’t fight back? That no matter whatyou say to him, however unfair, he’ll never use his own power against you, he’llnever treat you the way you treat him? Is this the way you treat people when youknow they won’t hit back? James Potter’s bullying genes, manifesting at last?Harry closed his eyes.Like the Sorting Hat speaking inside his head—What is the real reason for your anger?What do you fear?A whirlwind of images seemed to flash through Harry’s mind, then,the past Dumbledore weeping into his hands; the present form of the oldwizard, standing tall and terrible; a vision of Hermione screaming in herchains, in the metal chair, as Harry abandoned her to the Dementors; andan imagination of a woman with long white hair (had she looked like herhusband?) falling amid the flames of her bedroom, as a wand was heldupon her and orange light reflected from half-moon glasses.Albus Dumbledore had seemed to think that Harry would be better atthat sort of thing than him.And Harry knew that he probably would be. He knew the math, afterall.But it was understood, somehow it was understood, that utilitarianethicists didn’t actually rob banks so they could give the money to the poor.The end result of throwing away all ethical constraint wouldn’t actually besunshine and roses and happiness for all. The prescription of consequentialism was to take the action that led to the best net consequences, notactions that had one positive consequence and wrecked everything elsealong the way. Expected utility maximizers were allowed to take common sense into account, when they were calculating their expectations.Somehow Harry had understood that, even before anyone else hadwarned him he’d understood. Before he’d read about Vladimir Lenin orthe history of the French Revolution, he’d known. It might have been hisearliest science fiction books warning him about people with good intentions, or maybe Harry had just seen the logic for himself. Somehow he’dknown from the very beginning, that if he stepped outside his ethics whenever there was a reason, the end result wouldn’t be good.A final image came to him, then: Lily Potter standing in front of herbaby’s crib and measuring the intervals between outcomes: the final outcome if she stayed and tried to curse her enemy (dead Lily, dead Harry),the final outcome if she walked away (live Lily, dead Harry), weighing theexpected utilities, and making the only sensible choice.She would’ve been Harry’s mother if she had.“But human beings can’t live like that,” the boy’s lips whispered to theempty classroom. “Human beings can’t live like that.”hen Padma entered the Transfiguration classroom, she saw thathalf the class had beaten her there, a strange, deathly silence pervading the room. Harry Potter sat alone in one corner, staring off intosome unknown distance, his eyes half-lidded, nearly closed.Rumor said that the Aurors had discovered that the Defense Professorhad Polyjuiced as Granger to fool Malfoy.Rumor said that Hermione had been bound by the Unbreakable Vowto be Draco Malfoy’s slave.Rumor said that Hermione had gotten the Dementor’s Kiss.But if that were true, Harry Potter wouldn’t be sitting there, he wouldbe—Padma didn’t know what General Potter would do. Her mind wentblank, trying to think about it.Even when Professor McGonagall got there, the silence hadn’t broken.The Transfiguration Professor walked up to the board without a pause,erased it with a sweep of her hand, and then began to write.“Today, children,” began the calm professional voice of the Transfiguration Professor, just as though nothing out of the ordinary hadhappened that week, “we shall learn how much effort it takes to sustain a Transfiguration, and why, at your age, you should not even try.The original Form is not gone, only suppressed; and to maintain thatsuppression—”1341 *“Excuse me,” said Padma Patil. She knew her voice was shaking, sheknew that she was trembling visibly, but she had to ask. “Excuse me, Professor, what happened with Miss Granger?”The Transfiguration Professor paused at the board, and turned tolook at Padma. The Professor should have looked stern, having beeninterrupted without a hand being raised, but instead her face was kindly.“You don’t already know, Miss Patil? I expected that rumor would havespread.”“There’s too many rumors,” said Padma. “I don’t know what’s true.”Morag MacDougal raised her hand, then said without waiting to becalled, “I told you, Padma, what’s true is that the Wizengamot found Granger guilty and ordered her to get the Dementor’s Kiss and they broughtin the Dementor and Harry Potter glued it to the ceiling and wouldn’t letit down until—”“Oh, dear Merlin,” said Professor McGonagall, her expression growing sharp, but then she visibly calmed herself. “The affair was utterlyridiculous and I shan’t go into detail. Let it stand that Miss Granger isresting with Madam Pomfrey for now, and coming back to classes tomorrow. And if I catch anyone bothering her, I shall turn them into glassvases and drop them.”The entire class gasped at this; it wasn’t so much that the threat wasfatal, as that it broke the safety rules for Transfiguration.Professor McGonagall turned back to her board—From a corner of the classroom, another voice rose up. “What aboutProfessor Quirrell?” said Terry Boot. “Has he been arrested?”“The Aurors are only detaining him,” said the Transfiguration Professor without turning around. “If they have not given back our Defense Professor by tomorrow, I shall ask the Headmaster to go fetch him. ThoughI may as well tell you now that the Board of Governors has scheduled avote on whether Professor Quirrell’s battles shall be allowed to continue.”Kevin Entwhistle spoke. “And General Malfoy? When’s he gettingback from St. Mungo’s?”The Transfiguration Professor paused in her drawing.She turned around again, more slowly, this time.“I am sorry, Mr. Entwhistle,” said Professor McGonagall. Her facelooked a little more lined than when she had entered the room. “Mr. Malfoy’s health is in no danger, I am given to understand. Unfortunately,I have received an owl from Mr. Malfoy’s father withdrawing him fromHogwarts. I am afraid he is not coming back.”hen Hermione Granger woke, she found herself lying in a soft,comfortable bed of the Hogwarts infirmary, with a square ofsetting sunlight falling on her midriff, warm through the thin blanket.Memory said that there would be a screen-sheet above her, either drawnaround her bed or open, and that the rest of Madam Pomfrey’s domainwould lie beyond: the other beds, occupied or unoccupied, and brightwindows set in the curvily-carven stone of Hogwarts.When Hermione opened her eyes, the first thing she saw was theface of Professor McGonagall, sitting on the left side of her bed. Professor Flitwick wasn’t there, but that was understandable, he’d stayedby her side all morning in the detention cell, his silver raven standingextra guard against the Dementor and his stern little face always turnedoutward toward the Aurors. The Head of Ravenclaw had surely spentway too much time on her, and probably had to get back to teaching hisclasses, instead of keeping watch on a convicted attempted-murderess.She felt horribly, horribly sick and she didn’t think it was because ofany potions. Hermione would’ve started crying again, only her throathurt, her eyes still burned, and her mind just felt tired. She couldn’t haveborne to weep again, couldn’t find the strength for tears.“Where are my parents?” Hermione whispered to the Head of HouseGryffindor. Somehow it seemed like the worst thing in the world to facethem, even worse than everything else; and yet she still wanted to seethem.The gentle look on Professor McGonagall’s face Transfigured intosomething sadder. “I’m sorry, Miss Granger. Though it was not alwaysso, we have found in recent years that it is wiser not to tell the parentsof Muggleborns about any danger their child has faced. I should adviseyou also to remain silent, if you wish to stay at Hogwarts without troublefrom them.”“I’m not being expelled?” the girl whispered. “For what I did?”“No,” said Professor McGonagall. “Miss Granger… surely you heard…I hope you heard Mr. Potter, when he said that you were innocent?”“He was just saying that,” she said dully. “To get me free, I mean.”The older witch shook her head firmly. “No, Miss Granger. Mr. Potter believes you were Memory-Charmed, that the whole duel never happened. The Headmaster suspects even Darker magics may have beeninvolved—that your own hand might have cast the spell, but not yourown will. Even Professor Snape finds the affair completely unbelievable,though he may not be able to say so publicly. He was wondering if Muggledrugs might have been used on you.”Hermione’s eyes went on staring distantly at the Transfiguration Professor; she knew that she’d just been told something significant, but shecouldn’t find the energy to propagate any changes through her mind.“Surely you don’t believe it?” said Professor McGonagall. “Miss Granger, you cannot believe of yourself that you would turn to murder!”“But I—” Her excellent memory helpfully replayed it for the thousandth time, Draco Malfoy telling her with a sneer that she’d neverbeat him when he wasn’t tired, and then proceeding to prove just that,dancing like a duelist between the warded trophies while she franticallyscrambled, and dealing the ending blow with a hex that sent her crashing against the wall and drew blood from her cheek—and then—thenshe’d—“But you remember doing it,” said the older witch, who was watchingover her with kindly understanding. “Miss Granger, there is no need fora twelve-year-old girl to bear such dreadful memories. Say the word andI shall be happy to lock them away for you.”It was like a glass of warm water thrown into her face. “What?”Professor McGonagall took out her wand, a gesture so practiced andquick that it seemed like pointing a finger. “I can’t offer to rid you of thememories entirely, Miss Granger,” the Transfiguration Professor saidwith her customary precision. “There may be important facts buriedthere. But there is a form of the Memory Charm which is reversible, andI shall be happy to cast that on you.”Hermione stared at the wand, feeling the stirrings of hope for the firsttime in almost two days.Make it didn’t happen… she’d wished that over and over again, for thehands of time to turn back and erase the horrible choice that could never,ever be undone. And if erasing the memory wasn’t that, it was still a kindof release…She looked back at Professor McGonagall’s kindly face.“You really don’t think I did it?” Hermione said, her voice trembling.“I am quite certain you would never do such a thing of your own will.”Beneath her blankets, Hermione’s hands clutched at the sheets.“Harry doesn’t think I did it?”“Mr. Potter is of the opinion that your memories are entire fabrications. I can rather see his point.”Then Hermione’s clutching fingers let go of the sheet, and sheslumped back into the bed, from which she’d partially risen.No.She hadn’t said anything.She’d woken up and remembered what had happened last night, andit had been like—like—she couldn’t find words even in her own thoughtsfor what it had been like. But she’d known that Draco Malfoy was alreadydead, and she hadn’t said anything, hadn’t gone to Professor Flitwick andconfessed. She’d just dressed herself and gone down to breakfast andtried to act normal so that nobody would ever know, and she’d known itwas wrong and Wrong and horribly horribly WRONG but she’d been so,so scared—Even if Harry Potter was right, even if the duel with Draco Malfoy wasa lie, she’d made that choice all by herself. She didn’t deserve to forget that,or be forgiven for it.And if she had done the right thing, gone straight to ProfessorFlitwick, maybe that would’ve—helped, somehow, maybe everyonewould’ve seen then that she regretted it, and Harry wouldn’t have had togive away all his money to save her—Hermione shut her eyes, squeezed them shut really tight, she couldn’tbear to start crying again. “I’m a horrible person,” she said in a waveringvoice. “I’m awful, I’m not heroic at all—”Professor McGonagall’s voice was very sharp, like Hermione had justmade some dreadful mistake on her Transfiguration homework. “Stopbeing foolish, Miss Granger! Horrible is whoever did this to you. And asfor being heroic—well, Miss Granger, you have already heard my opinionabout young girls trying to involve themselves in such things before theyare even fourteen, so I shall not lecture you on it again. I shall say only thatyou have just had an absolutely dreadful experience, which you survivedas well as any witch in your year possibly could. Today you are allowed tocry as much as you like. Tomorrow you are going back to class.”That was when Hermione knew that Professor McGonagall couldn’thelp her. She needed someone to scold her, she couldn’t be absolved ifshe couldn’t be blamed, and Professor McGonagall would never do thatfor her, would never ask so much of a little Ravenclaw girl.It was something Harry Potter wouldn’t help her with either.Hermione turned over in the infirmary bed, huddling into herself,away from Professor McGonagall. “Please,” she whispered. “I want totalk—to the Headmaster—”“Hermione.”When Hermione Granger opened her eyes a second time, she saw thecare-lined face of Albus Dumbledore leaning over her bedside, lookingalmost as though he’d been crying, though that was impossible; and Hermione felt another stabbing pang of guilt for having bothered him so.“Minerva said you wished to speak with me,” the old wizard said.“I—” Suddenly Hermione didn’t know at all what to say. Her throatlocked up, and all she could do was stammer, “I—I’m—”Somehow her tone must have communicated the other word, the oneshe couldn’t even say anymore.“Sorry?” said Dumbledore. “Why, for what should you be sorry?”She had to force the words out of her throat. “You were telling Harry—that he shouldn’t pay—so I shouldn’t—have done what Professor McGonagall said, I shouldn’t have touched his wand—”“My dear,” said Dumbledore, “had you not pledged yourself to theHouse of Potter, Harry would have attacked Azkaban singlehandedly,and quite possibly won. That boy may choose his words carefully, butI have never yet known him to lie; and in the Boy-Who-Lived there ispower that the Dark Lord never knew. He would indeed have tried tobreak Azkaban, even at cost of his life.” The old wizard’s voice grewgentler, and kinder. “No, Hermione, you have nothing at all for which toblame yourself.”“I could have made him not do it.”In Dumbledore’s eyes a small twinkle appeared before it was lost toweariness. “Really, Miss Granger? Perhaps you should be Headmistressin my place, for I myself have no such power over stubborn children.”“Harry promised—” Her voice stopped. The awful truth was very hardto speak. “Harry Potter promised me—that he would never help me—if Itold him not to.”There was a pause. The distant noises of the infirmary that had accompanied Professor McGonagall had ceased, Hermione realized, whenDumbledore had awoken her. From where she lay in bed she could seeonly the ceiling, and the top of one wall’s windows, but nothing in herrange of vision moved, and if there were sounds, she could not hear them.“Ah,” said Dumbledore. The old wizard sighed heavily. “I suppose itis possible that the boy would have kept his promise.”“I should—I should’ve—”“Gone to Azkaban of your own will?” Dumbledore said. “Miss Granger, that is more than I would ever ask anyone to take upon themselves.”“But—” Hermione swallowed. She couldn’t help but notice the loophole, anyone who wanted to get through the portrait-door to the Ravenclaw dorm quickly learned to pay attention to exact wordings. “But it’snot more than you’d take on yourself.”“Hermione—” the old wizard began.“Why?” said Hermione’s voice, it seemed to be running on withouther mind, now. “Why couldn’t I be braver? I was going to run in front ofthe Dementor—for Harry—before, I mean, in January—so why—why—why couldn’t I—” Why had the thought of being sent to Azkaban just completely unglued her, why had she forgotten everything about being Good—“My dear girl,” Dumbledore said. The blue eyes behind the half-moonglasses showed a complete understanding of her guilt. “I would havedone no better myself, in my first year in Hogwarts. As you would bekind to others, be kinder to yourself as well.”“So I did do the wrong thing.” Somehow she needed to say that, to betold that, even though she already knew.There was a pause.“Listen, young Ravenclaw,” the old wizard said, “hear me well, for Ishall speak to you a truth. Most ill-doers do not think of themselves asevil; indeed, most conceive themselves the heroes of the stories they tell.I once thought that the greatest evil in this world was done in the nameof the greater good. I was wrong. Terribly wrong. There is evil in thisworld which knows itself for evil, and hates the good with all its strength.All fair things does it desire to destroy.”Hermione shivered in her bed, somehow it seemed very real, whenDumbledore said it.The old wizard continued speaking. “You are one of the fair things ofthis world, Hermione Granger, and so that evil hates you as well. If youhad stayed firm through even this trial, it would have struck you harderand yet harder, until you shattered. Do not think that heroes cannot bebroken! We are only more difficult to break, Hermione.” The old wizard’seyes had grown sterner than she had ever seen. “When you have beenexhausted for many hours, when pain and death is not a passing fear buta certainty, then it is harder to be a hero. If I must speak the truth—thentoday, yes, I would not waver in the face of Azkaban. But when I was afirst-year in Hogwarts—I would have fled from the Dementor that youconfronted, for my father had died in Azkaban, and I feared them. Knowthis! The evil that struck at you could have broken anyone, even myself.Only Harry Potter has it within him to face that horror, when he has comefully into his power.”Hermione’s neck couldn’t stare at the old wizard any longer; she lether head fall back, back to the pillow, where she stared up at the ceiling,absorbing what she could.“Why?” Her voice trembled again. “Why would anyone be that evil? Idon’t understand.”“I, too, have wondered,” said Dumbledore’s voice, a deep sadness in it.“For thrice ten years I wondered, and I still do not understand. You and Iwill never understand, Hermione Granger. But at least I know now whattrue evil would say for itself, if we could speak to it and ask why it was evil.It would say, Why not?”A brief flare of indignation inside her. “There’s got to be a million reasons why not!”“Indeed,” said Dumbledore’s voice. “A million reasons and more. Wewill always know those reasons, you and I. If you insist on putting it thatway—then yes, Hermione, this day’s trial broke you. But what happens after you break—that, too, is part of being a hero. Which you are, HermioneGranger, and will always be.”She raised her head again, staring at him.The old wizard got up from beside her bed. His silver beard dippeddown, as Dumbledore bowed to her gravely, and left.She went on looking at where the old wizard had gone.It should have meant something to her, should have touched her.Should have made her felt better inside, that Dumbledore, who hadseemed so reluctant before, had now acknowledged her as a hero.She felt nothing.Hermione let her head fall back to the bed, as Madam Pomfrey cameand made her drink something that seared her lips like the afterburn ofspicy food, and smelled even hotter, and didn’t taste like anything at all.It meant nothing to her. She went on staring up at the distant stone tilesof the ceiling.1351 *Minerva was waiting, doing her best not to hover, beside the double doorsto the Hogwarts infirmary, she’d always thought of those doors as “theominous gates” as a child in Hogwarts, and couldn’t help but rememberthat now. Too much bad news had been spoken here—Albus stepped out. The old wizard did not pause on the way out ofthe infirmary, only kept walking toward Professor Flitwick’s office; andMinerva followed him.Professor McGonagall cleared her throat. “Is it done, Albus?”The old wizard nodded in affirmation. “If any hostile magic is cast onher, or any spirit touches her, I shall know, and come.”“I spoke to Mr. Potter after Transfiguration class,” said ProfessorMcGonagall. “He was of the opinion that Miss Granger should go toBeauxbatons, rather than Hogwarts, from now on.”The old wizard shook his head. “No. If Voldemort truly desires tostrike at Miss Granger—he is tenacious beyond measure. His servantsare returning to him, he could not have retrieved Bellatrix alone. Azkaban itself is not safe from his malice, and as for Beauxbatons—no,Minerva. I do not think Voldemort can essay such possessions often, oragainst stronger targets, or this year would have gone quite differently.And Harry Potter is here, whom Voldemort must fear whether he admitsit or no. Now that I have warded her, Miss Granger will be safer withinHogwarts than without.”“Mr. Potter seemed to doubt that,” Minerva said. She couldn’t quitekeep the edge from her voice; there was a part of her that agreed ratherstrongly. “He seemed to feel that common sense said Miss Grangershould continue her education anywhere but Hogwarts.”The old wizard sighed. “I fear the boy has spent too much timeamong the Muggles. Always they reach for safety; always they imaginethat safety can be reached. If Miss Granger is not safe within the centerof our fortress, she shall be no safer for leaving it.”“Not everyone seems to think so,” said Professor McGonagall. It hadbeen almost the first letter she’d seen when she’d taken a quick look at herdesk; an envelope of the finest sheepskin, sealed in greenish-silver wax,pressed into the image of a snake that rose and hissed at her. “I havereceived Lord Malfoy’s owl withdrawing his son from Hogwarts.”The old wizard nodded, but did not break stride. “Does Harry know?”“Yes.” Her voice faltered, for a moment, remembering Harry’s expression. “After class, Mr. Potter complimented Lord Malfoy’s excellent goodsense, and said that he would be writing Madam Longbottom advisingher to do the same with her grandson, in case he was the next target. Inthe event that Mr. Longbottom’s guardian was so negligent as to keephim in Hogwarts, Mr. Potter wanted him to have a Time-Turner, an invisibility cloak, a broomstick, and a pouch in which to carry them; alsoa toe-ring with an emergency portkey to a safe location, in case someone kidnaps Mr. Longbottom and takes him outside Hogwarts’s wards. Itold Mr. Potter that I did not think the Ministry would consent to suchuse of our Time-Turners, and he said that we should not ask. I expecthe will want Miss Granger to receive the same, if she stays. And for himself Mr. Potter wants a three-person broomstick to carry in his pouch.”She wasn’t awed by the list of precautions. Impressed with the cleverness, but not awed; she was a Transfiguration Mistress, after all. But itstill sent shivers of disquiet through her, that Harry Potter now thoughtHogwarts as dangerous as spell research.“The Department of Mysteries is not lightly defied,” said Albus. “Butfor the rest—” The old wizard seemed to slump in on himself slightly. “Wemay as well give the boy what he wishes. And I will ward Neville also, andwrite Augusta to say that he should stay here over holiday.”“And finally,” she said, “Mr. Potter says—this is a direct quote, Albus—whatever kind of Dark Wizard attractant the Headmaster is keeping here,he needs to get it out of this school, now.” She couldn’t stop the edge inher own voice, that time.“I asked as much of Flamel,” Albus said, the pain clear in his voice.“But Master Flamel has said—that even he can no longer keep safe theStone—that he believes Voldemort has means of finding it wherever it ishidden—and that he does not consent for it to be guarded anywhere butHogwarts. Minerva, I am sorry, but it must be done—must!”“Very well,” said Professor McGonagall. “But for myself, I think thatMr. Potter is right on every single count.”The old wizard glanced at her, and his voice caught as he said, “Minerva, you have known me long, and as well as any soul still living—tell me,have I lost myself to darkness already?”“What?” said Professor McGonagall in genuine surprise. Then, “Oh,Albus, no!”The old wizard’s lips pressed together tightly before he spoke. “Forthe greater good. I have sacrificed so many, for the greater good. TodayI almost condemned Hermione Granger to Azkaban for the greater good.And I find myself—today, I found myself—beginning to resent the innocence that is no longer mine—” The old wizard’s voice halted. “Evil donein the name of good. Evil done in the name of evil. Which is worse?”“You are being silly, Albus.”The old wizard glanced at her again, before turning his eyes back totheir way. “Tell me, Minerva—did you pause to weigh the consequences,before you told Miss Granger how to bind herself to the Potter family?”She took an involuntary breath as she understood what she haddone—“So you did not.” Albus’s eyes were saddened. “No, Minerva, you mustnot apologize. It is well. For what you have seen of me this day—if yourfirst loyalty is now to Harry Potter, and not to me, then that is right andproper.” She opened her lips to protest, but Albus went on before shecould say a word. “Indeed—indeed—that will be necessary and morethan necessary, if the Dark Lord that Harry must defeat to come into hispower is not Voldemort after all—”“Not this again!” Minerva said. “Albus, it was You-Know-Who, notyou, who marked Harry as his equal. There is no possible way that theprophecy could be talking about you!”The old wizard nodded, but his eyes still seemed distant, fixed onlyon the road ahead.The holding cell, well to the center of Magical Law Enforcement, was luxuriously appointed; more a remark on what adult wizards took for granted,than any special feeling toward prisoners. There was a self-reclining, selfrocking chair with plush, richly textured, self-warming cushions. Therewas a bookcase containing random books rescued from a bargain bin,and a full shelf of ancient magazines, including one from 1883. As for toiletries, well, it wasn’t exactly luxurious, but there was a spell on the roomwhich put all that business on hold; you weren’t to go anywhere that thewatching Auror couldn’t see you. But aside from that, it was quite a pleasant little cell. The Defense Professor of Hogwarts was being detained, notarrested, not even intimidated. There was no evidence to indict him… except that a terrible and unusual crime had been committed at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and going by previous occasions the odds were five to one that the current Defense Professor wastangled up in it somehow. To this must be added the fact that nobody inthe D.M.L.E. even knew who the Defense Professor was, and that the manhad literally sneezed at all attempts to uncover his true identity. Why, no,they hadn’t released ‘Quirinus Quirrell’ back to Hogwarts just yet.Let us repeat this for emphasis:The Defense Professor.Was being detained.In a cell.The Defense Professor was staring at the watching Auror and humming.The Defense Professor has not spoken a single word since he arrivedin this particular cell. He has only been humming.The humming started as a simple children’s lullaby, the one that inMuggle Britain begins, Lullaby, and goodnight…This tune was hummed, without variation, over and over, for sevenminutes, to establish the underlying pattern.Then began the elaborations upon the theme. Phrases hummed tooslow, with long pauses in between, so that the listener’s mind helplesslywaits and waits for the next note, the next phrase. And then, when thatnext phrase comes, it is so out of key, so unbelievably awfully out of key,not just out of key for the previous phrases but sung at a pitch which doesnot correspond to any key, that you would have to believe this person hadspent hours deliberately practicing their humming just to acquire suchperfect anti-pitch.It bears the same semblance to music as the awful dead voice of a Dementor bears to human speech.And this horrible, horrible humming is impossible to ignore. It is similar to a known lullaby, but it departs from that pattern unpredictably.It sets up expectations and then violates them, never in any constantpattern that would permit the humming to fade into the background.The listener’s brain cannot prevent itself from expecting the anti-musicalphrases to complete, nor prevent itself from noticing the surprises.The only possible explanation for how this mode of humming cameto exist is that it was deliberately designed by some unspeakably cruelgenius who woke up one day, feeling bored with ordinary torture, whodecided to handicap himself and find out whether he could break someone’s sanity just by humming at them.The Auror has been listening to this unimaginably dreadful hummingfor four hours, while being stared at by a huge, cold, lethal presence thatfeels equally horrible whether he looks at it directly or lets it hover at thecorner of his vision—The humming stopped.There was a long wait. Time enough for false hope to rise, andbe squashed down by the memory of previous disappointments. Andthen, as the interval lengthened, and lengthened, that hope rose againunstoppably—The humming began once more.The Auror cracked.From his belt, the Auror took a mirror, tapped it once, and then said,“This is Junior Auror Arjun Altunay, I’m calling in code RJ-L20 on cellthree.”“Code RJ-L20?” the mirror said in surprised tones. There was a soundof pages being flipped, then, “You want to be relieved because a prisoneris attempting psychological warfare and succeeding?”(Amelia Bones really is quite intelligent.)“What’d the prisoner say to you?” said the mirror.(This question is not part of procedure RJ-L20, but unfortunatelyAmelia Bones has failed to include an explicit instruction that the commanding officer should not ask.)“He’s—” said the Auror, and glanced back at the cell. The Defense Professor was now leaning in back in his chair, looking quite relaxed. “Hewas staring at me! And humming!”There was a pause.The mirror spoke again. “And you’re calling in an RJ-L20 over that?You’re sure you’re not just trying to get out of watching him?”(Amelia Bones is surrounded by idiots.)“You don’t understand!” yelled Auror Altunay. “It’s really awful humming!”The mirror transmitted a sound of muffled laughter in the background, sounding like it was coming from more than one person. Thenspeech again. “Mr. Altunay, if you don’t want to be busted to Junior AurorSecond Class, I suggest you buckle down and get back to work—”“Strike that,” a crisp voice said, sounding slightly remote due to itsdistance from the mirror.(Which is why Amelia Bones often sits in on a coordination center ofthe D.M.L.E. while doing her Ministry-required paperwork.)“Auror Altunay,” said the crisp voice, seeming to approach closer tothe mirror, “you will be relieved shortly. Auror Ben Gutierrez, the procedure for RJ-L20 does not say that you ask why. It says that you relieve theAuror who calls it in. If I find that Aurors seem to be abusing it, I willmodify the procedure to prevent its abuse—” The mirror cut off abruptly.The Auror turned back to look triumphantly at where the current Defense Professor of Hogwarts was leaning back in his cushioned chair.That man then spoke the first words that had left his lips since he entered the cell.“Goodbye, Mr. Altunay,” said the Defense Professor.A few minutes later, the door to the detention cell opened, and inwalked a grey-haired woman, dressed in the crimson-tinged robes of anAuror without any sign of rank or other ornamentation, carrying a blackleather folder under her left arm. “You’re relieved,” the old woman saidabruptly.There was a brief delay while Auror Altunay tried to explain what hadbeen happening. This was cut short by a nod and a stark, simple fingerpointing out the door.“Good evening, Madam Director,” said the Defense Professor.Amelia Bones did not acknowledge this statement, but sat downabruptly in the vacated chair. The old witch opened the black folderand her gaze moved down to the parchments therein. “Possible hintsto the identity of the current Hogwarts Defense Professor, as compiledby Auror Robards.” The title parchment was turned, flipped aside. “TheDefense Professor said that he was Sorted into Slytherin. Claimed thathis family was killed by Voldemort. Said he had studied at a martial artscenter in Muggle Asia which was destroyed by Voldemort. A request filedwith the Department of International Magical Cooperation identifiesthis incident as the Oni Affair of 1969.” Another parchment was flippedaside. “It also seems this Defense Professor gave a most stirring speechto his students, just before last Yule, castigating the previous generationfor their disunity against the Death Eaters.” The old witch looked upfrom the leather folder. “Madam Longbottom was rather taken with it,and insisted that I read the entire thing. The argument struck me asfamiliar, though I could not place it at the time. But then, of course, Ihad thought you dead.”The chief law enforcement officer of Magical Britain was now gazingsharply at the current Defense Professor of Hogwarts, across the pane ofspell-reinforced glass separating them. The man in the cell returned thegaze equably, without apparent alarm.“I shall not name any names,” said the old witch. “But I shall tell astory, and see if it sounds familiar.” Amelia Bones looked back down,turning to the next parchment. “Born 1927, entered Hogwarts in 1938,sorted into Slytherin, graduated 1945. Went on a graduation tour abroadand disappeared while visiting Albania. Presumed dead until 1970, whenhe returned to magical Britain just as suddenly, without any explanationfor the missing twenty-five years. He remained estranged from his family and friends, living in isolation. In 1971, while visiting Diagon Alley, hefended off an attempt by Bellatrix Black to kidnap the daughter of theMinister of Magic, and used the Killing Curse to slay two of the threeDeath Eaters accompanying her. Beyond this all Britain knows the story;need I continue it?” The old witch looked up from her folder again. “Verywell. There was a trial in the Wizengamot, during which this young manwas exonerated for his use of the Killing Curse, not least due to the ef* 1358 *forts of his grandmother, the Lady of his House. He was reconciled withhis family, and they held a House gathering to welcome his return. Theguest of honor arrived at that gathering to find his entire family slain byDeath Eaters, even to the house elves; and that he himself, of cadet line,was now the last remaining scion of a Most Ancient House.”The Defense Professor had not reacted at all to any of this, except thathis eyes had half-closed, as though in weariness.“The young man took up his family’s seat in the Wizengamot, becoming among the most steadfast voices against You-Know-Who. Severaltimes he led forces against the Death Eaters, fighting with skillful tactics and extraordinary power. People began to speak of him as the nextDumbledore, it was thought that he might become Minister of Magic after the Dark Lord fell. On the third of July, 1973, he failed to appear ata key Wizengamot vote, and was never heard from again. We assumedYou-Know-Who had killed him. It was a grave blow to all of us, and matters went much the worse from that day on.” The old witch’s gaze wasquestioning. “I mourned you myself. What happened?”The Defense Professor’s shoulders moved lightly, a small shrug. “Youmake many assumptions,” the Defense Professor said softly. “For myself, I would believe that man died years ago. But if that man is nonetheless alive—then it is clear he does not wish the fact announced, and hasreasons enough for silence. That man was once of some help to you, itseems.” The Defense Professor’s lips curved in a cynical smile. “But I amno longer surprised when gratitude is fleeting. Is there yet more that youwould demand from him?”The old witch leaned back in her Auror’s monitoring-chair, lookingrather startled, maybe even hurt. “No—” she said after a moment. Herfingers tapped the leather folder; nervously, you might have thought, ifyou had believed that Amelia Bones could ever be nervous. “But yourHouse—there are not many Ancient Houses remaining—”“It shall matter little to this country whether eight Ancient Housesremain, or seven.”The old witch sighed. “What does Dumbledore think of this?”The man in the detention cell shook his head. “He does not know whoI am, and promised not to inquire.”The old witch’s eyebrows rose. “How did he identify you to the Hogwarts wards, then?”A slight smile. “The Headmaster drew a circle, and told Hogwarts thathe who stood within was the Defense Professor. Speaking of which—”The tone went lower, flatter. “I am missing my classes, Director Bones.”“You seem to—rest, sometimes, in a peculiar manner. This has alsobeen reported. And you seem to be resting more and more frequently, astime goes on.” The old witch’s fingers tapped the leather folder again.“I cannot recall reading of such a symptom, but when one hears ofsuch a thing, one imagines… Dark Wizards fought, and terrible cursesreceived…”The Defense Professor remained expressionless.“Do you require a healer’s help?” said Amelia Bones. Her own maskhad slipped, clearly showing the pain in her eyes. “Is there anything at allthat can be done for you?”“I agreed to teach Defense at Hogwarts,” the man in the cell said flatly.“Draw your own conclusions, Madam. And I am missing my classes, ofwhich there are not many left. I would return to Hogwarts, now.”When Hermione woke the third time (though it felt like she’d only closedher eyes for a moment) the Sun was even lower in the sky, almost fully set.She felt a little more alive and, strangely, even more exhausted. This timeit was Professor Flitwick who was standing next to her bed and shakingher shoulder, a tray of steaming food floating next to him. For some reason she’d thought Harry Potter ought to be leaning over her bedside, buthe wasn’t there. Had she dreamed that? She couldn’t remember dreaming.It developed (according to Professor Flitwick) that Hermione hadmissed dinner in the Great Hall, and was being woken to eat. And thenshe could go back to the Ravenclaw dorm, and her own bed, to sleep therest of the night.She ate in silence. There was a part of her that wanted to ask ProfessorFlitwick whether he thought she’d been Memory-Charmed or she’d triedto kill Draco Malfoy of her own will——like she remembered doing——but most of her was afraid to find out. Afraid to find out was a warning sign, according to Harry Potter and his books; but her mind felt tired,bruised, and she couldn’t muster the strength to override it.When she and Professor Flitwick left the infirmary they found HarryPotter sitting cross-legged outside the door, quietly reading a psychologytextbook.“I’ll take her from here,” said the Boy-Who-Lived. “Professor McGonagall said it would be all right.”Professor Flitwick seemed to accept this, and departed after a sternlook at both of them. She couldn’t imagine what the stern look was supposed to say, unless it was don’t try to kill any more students.The footsteps of Professor Flitwick faded, and the two of them stoodalone outside the doors of the infirmary.She looked at the green eyes of the Boy-Who-Lived, the mess of hairthat didn’t quite obscure the scar on his forehead; she looked upon theface of the boy who’d given all his money to save her without a secondthought. There were feelings inside her—guilt, shame, embarrassment,other things as well—but no words. There was nothing she knew how tosay.“So,” Harry said abruptly, “I did a quick skim through my psychologybooks to see what they said about post-traumatic stress disorder. The oldbooks said you should talk about the experience immediately afterwardwith a counselor. The newer research says that when they actually ranexperiments, it turned out that talking about it immediately afterwardmade it worse. Apparently what you really ought to do is run with yourmind’s natural impulse to repress the memories and just not think aboutit for a while.”It was so normal for the way she and Harry usually talked that she felta sudden burning in her throat.We don’t have to talk about it. That was what Harry had just said, moreor less. It felt like cheating, maybe even like a lie. Nothing was normal.1361 *Everything wrong was still horribly wrong, everything left unsaid stillneeded to be said…“Okay,” said Hermione, because there wasn’t anything else to say, anything else at all.“I’m sorry I wasn’t waiting when you woke up,” Harry said, as theystarted to walk. “Madam Pomfrey wouldn’t let me in, so I just stayed outhere.” He gave a small, sad-looking shrug. “I suppose I should be outthere trying to run damage control on public relations, but… honestly I’venever been good at that, I just end up speaking sharply at people.”“How bad is it?” She thought her voice should have come out in a whisper, a croak, but it didn’t.“Well—” Harry said with obvious hesitation. “The thing you’ve got tounderstand, Hermione, is that you had a lot of defenders at breakfasttime today, but everyone on your side was… making stuff up. Draco triedto kill you first, things like that. It was Granger versus Malfoy, that’show people saw it, like a seesaw where pushing his side down meantpushing your side up. I told them you were probably both innocent, thatyou’d both been Memory-Charmed. They didn’t listen, both sides treatedme like a traitor trying to play the middle. And then people heard thatDraco had testified under Veritaserum that he’d been trying to help youbefore the battle—stop making that expression, Hermione, you didn’t actually do anything to him. Anyway, all people understood was that thepro-Malfoy faction had been right and the pro-Granger faction had beenwrong.” Harry gave a small sigh. “I told them that when the truth cameout later they’d be embarrassed…”“How bad is it?” she said again. This time her voice did come outweaker.“Remember Asch’s conformity experiment?” Harry said, turning hishead to give her a serious look.Her mind was slow to remember for a few seconds, which frightenedher, but then the reference came back. In 1951, Solomon Asch had takensome experimental subjects, and each one had been put among a row ofother people who looked like them, seeming like other experimental subjects, but actually confederates of the experimenter. They’d shown a reference line on a screen, labeled X, next to three other lines, labeled A, B,and C. The experimenter had asked which line X was the same length as.The correct answer had obviously been C. The other ‘subjects’, the confederates, had one after another said that X was the same length as B. Thereal subject had been put second-to-last in the order, so as not to arousesuspicion by being last. The test had been to see whether the real subjectwould ‘conform’ to the standard wrong answer of B, or voice the obviouslycorrect answer of C.75% of the subjects had ‘conformed’ at least once. A third of the subjects had conformed more than half the time. Some had reported afterward actually believing that X was the same length as B. And that hadbeen in a case where the subjects hadn’t known any of the confederates.If you put people around others who belonged to the same group as them,like someone in a wheelchair next to other people in a wheelchair, the conformity effect got even stronger…Hermione had a sickening feeling where this was going. “I remember,” she whispered.“I gave the Chaos Legion anti-conformity training, you know. I hadeach Legionnaire stand in the middle and say ‘Twice two is four!’ or ‘Grassis green!’ while everyone else in the Chaos Legion called them idiots orsneered at them—Allen Flint did really good sneers—or even just gavethem blank looks and then walked away. The thing you’ve got to remember is, only the Chaos Legion has ever practiced anything like that. Nobody else in Hogwarts even knows what conformity is.”“Harry!” Her voice was wobbling. “How bad is it?”Harry gave another sad-looking shrug. “Everyone in the second yearand above, since they don’t know you. Everyone in Dragon Army. All ofSlytherin, of course. And, well, most of the rest of magical Britain too, Ithink. Remember, Lucius Malfoy controls the Daily Prophet.”“Everyone?” she whispered. Her limbs had started to feel cold, likeshe’d just gotten out of an unheated swimming pool.“What people really believe doesn’t feel like a belief, it feels like the waythe world is. You and I are standing in a private little bubble of the universe where Hermione Granger got Memory-Charmed. Everyone else isliving in the world where Hermione Granger tried to murder Draco Malfoy. If Ernie Macmillian—”Her breath caught in her throat. Captain Macmillian—“—thinks he’s ethically prohibited from being your friend now, well,he’s trying to do the right thing as he understands it, in the world hethinks he lives in.” Harry’s eyes were very serious. “Hermione, you’ve toldme a lot of times that I look down too much on other people. But if I expected too much of them—if I expected people to get things right—I reallywould hate them, then. Idealism aside, Hogwarts students don’t actuallyknow enough cognitive science to take responsibility for how their ownminds work. It’s not their fault they’re crazy.” Harry’s voice was strangelygentle, almost like an adult’s. “I know it’s going to be harder on you thanit would be on me. But remember, eventually the real culprit gets nailed.The truth comes out, everyone who was confidently wrong gets embarrassed.”“And if the real culprit doesn’t get caught?” she said in a tremblingvoice.…or if it turns out to be me after all?“Then you can leave Hogwarts and go to the Salem Witches’ Institutein America.”“Leave Hogwarts?” She’d never even thought of that possibility exceptas an ultimate punishment.“I… Hermione, I think you might want to do that anyway. Hogwartsisn’t a castle, it’s insanity with walls. You have got other options.”“I’ll…” she stammered. “I’ll have… to think about it…”Harry nodded. “ At least nobody’s going to try hexing you, not afterwhat the Headmaster said at dinner tonight. Oh, and Ron Weasley cameup to me, looking very serious, and told me that if I saw you first, I shouldtell you that he’s sorry for having thought badly of you, and he’ll neverspeak ill of you again.”“Ron believes I’m innocent?” said Hermione.“Well… he doesn’t think you’re innocent, per se…”The whole Ravenclaw dorm went silent as the two of them walked in.Staring at them.Staring at her.(She’d had nightmares like this.)And then, one by one, people looked away from her.Penelope Clearwater, the 5th-year prefect in charge of first-years,looked away slowly and deliberately, turning her head to face in anotherdirection.Su Li and Lisa Turpin and Michael Corner, all sitting at a table together, all of whom she’d helped with their homework at one time oranother, all looked away, their faces suddenly nervous, the moment shetried to catch their eyes.A third-year witch named Latisha Randle, whom sphew had twicesaved from Slytherin bullies, quickly bent back over her desk and starteddoing homework again.Mandy Brocklehurst looked away from her.If Hermione didn’t burst into tears, then, it was only because she’dexpected it, had played it out in her mind over and over again. At leastpeople weren’t screaming at her or shoving her or hexing her. They werejust looking away—Hermione walked very straight up to the staircaise that led toward thefirst-year girl’s dorms. (She didn’t see Padma Patil or Anthony Goldsteinlooking at her, those two lone heads turning to track her as she left.) Frombehind her, she heard Harry Potter saying in a very calm tone, “Now eventually the truth’s going to come out, you all. So if you’re all that confidentshe’s guilty, can I ask you all to sign this paper right here, saying that ifshe later turns out to be innocent, she gets to say ‘I told you so’ and thenhold it over you for the rest of your lives? Step on up, one and all, don’t becowards, if you really believe you shouldn’t be afraid to bet—”She was halfway up the stairs when she realized that there would beother girls inside her dorm room, too.The stars hadn’t quite come out yet, only one or two of the brightest onesvisible through the reddish-purple haze of the horizon, though the sunhad fully sunk.Hermione’s hands dug into the harsh stone of the parapet guardingthe small balcony, where she’d ducked out of the stairwell after realizingthat——she couldn’t just go back to bed——the words echoed in her mind like ‘You can’t go home again’ oughtto sound.She stared out at the empty grounds, the fading sunset, the sproutinggrass so far below.Tired, she was tired, she couldn’t think now, she needed to sleep. Professor Flitwick had told her that she needed to sleep, and there’d been yetanother potion with her dinner. Maybe that was how wizarding societytreated horrible traumas to innocent young girls, just made them sleep alot afterward.She should go to her room and sleep, but she was afraid to go someplace where other people were. Afraid of how they might look at her, orlook away.Fragments of thought chased themselves around a mind too exhausted to finish or connect them, as the night fully set in.Why—Why did all this happen—Everything was fine a week ago—Why—From behind her came the creaky sound of an opening door.She turned her head and looked.Professor Quirrell was leaning against the doorway she’d walkedthrough, silhouetted like a cardboard cutout by the light of the Hogwartstorches lit behind him, in the open door. She couldn’t see his expression,though the doorway behind him was bright; his eyes, his face, everythingshe could see from here lay within night’s shadow.The Defense Professor of Hogwarts, number one on the list of peoplewho might’ve done this. She hadn’t even realized she had a suspect listuntil that moment.The man stood within that doorway, saying nothing; and she couldn’tsee his eyes. What was he even doing there in the first place—“Are you here to kill me?” said Hermione Granger.Professor Quirrell’s head tilted at that.Then the Defense Professor started toward her, the dark silhouetteraising one hand slowly and deliberately, as though to push her off theRavenclaw tower—“Stupefy!”The burst of adrenaline overrode everything, she drew her wand without thinking, her lips formed the word of their own accord, the stunboltleapt out of her wand and——slowed to a stop in front of Professor Quirrell’s raised hand, ripplingin midair like it was still trying to fly and making a slight hissing sound.The red glow illuminated Professor Quirrell’s face for the first time,showing a strange fond smile.“Better,” said Professor Quirrell. “Miss Granger, you are still a studentin my Defense class. As such, if you consider me a threat, I do not expectyou to just look at me sadly and ask if I am there to kill you. Minus twoQuirrell points.”She was entirely unable to form words.The Defense Professor flicked his forefinger casually at the suspended stunbolt, sending the hex shooting back over her head, far intothe night, so that they stood again in darkness. Then Professor Quirrellwalked out of the doorway, which swung shut behind him; and a softwhite light sprung up around the two of them, so that she could see hisface once more, still with that strange fond smile.“What are you—what are you doing here?”A few more steps took Professor Quirrell to a higher part of the balcony’s ramparts, where he put his elbows down on the stone, and leanedover heavily, looking up into the night.“I came here straight upon being released by the Aurors, the momentI finished reporting to the Headmaster,” said Professor Quirrell in a quietvoice, “because I am your teacher, and you are my student, and I am responsible for you.”Hermione understood, then; remembering what Professor Quirrellhad said to Harry in the second Defense lesson of the year, about controlling his anger. She felt the flush of shame all the way down her chest. Ittook a moment after that for knowledge to override mortification, for herto force out the words—“I—” said Hermione. “Harry thinks—that I didn’t—lose my temper, Imean—”“So I heard,” said Professor Quirrell in rather dry tones. He shook hishead, as though at the stars themselves. “The boy is fortunate that I havecrossed the line from annoyance with his self-destructiveness, into sheercuriosity as to what he shall do next. But I agree with Mr. Potter’s assessment of the facts. This murder was well-planned to evade detection bothby the wards of Hogwarts and the Headmaster’s timely eye. Naturally,in such a thoughtful murder, some innocent would be placed to take theblame.” A brief, wry smile crossed the Defense Professor’s lips, though hewasn’t looking at her. “As for the notion that you did it yourself—I consider myself a talented teacher, but even I could not teach such murderous intent to a student as obstinate and untalented as Hermione Granger.”The part of her brain that said What? in indignation wasn’t anywherenear loud enough to reach her lips.“No…” said Professor Quirrell. “That is not why I am here. You havemade no effort to hide your dislike for me, Miss Granger. I thank you forthat lack of pretense, for I much prefer true hate to false love. But you arestill my student, and I have a word to say to you, if you will hear it.”Hermione looked at him, still fighting down the aftereffects of theadrenaline from before. The Defense Professor seemed to be just staringup at the dark sky, in which the stars were becoming visible.“I was going to be a hero, once,” said Professor Quirrell, still lookingupward. “Can you believe that, Miss Granger?”“No.”“Thank you again, Miss Granger. It is true nonetheless. Long ago,long before your time or Harry Potter’s, there was a man who was hailedas a savior. The destined scion, such a one as anyone would recognizefrom tales, wielding justice and vengeance like twin wands against hisdreadful nemesis.” Professor Quirrell gave a soft, bitter laugh, lookingup at the night sky. “Do you know, Miss Granger, at that time I thoughtmyself already cynical, and yet… well.”The silence stretched, in the cold and the night.“In all honesty,” said Professor Quirrell, looking up at the stars, “I stilldon’t understand it. They should have known that their lives dependedon that man’s success. And yet it was as if they tried to do everythingthey could to make his life unpleasant. To throw every possible obstacleinto his way. I was not naive, Miss Granger, I did not expect the powerholders to align themselves with me so quickly—not without somethingin it for themselves. But their power, too, was threatened; and so I wasshocked how they seemed content to step back, and leave to that man allburdens of responsibility. They sneered at his performance, remarkingamong themselves how they would do better in his place, though they didnot condescend to step forward.” Professor Quirrell shook his head asthough in bemusement. “And it was the strangest thing—the Dark Wizard, that man’s dread nemesis—why, those who served him leapt eagerlyto their tasks. The Dark Wizard grew crueler toward his followers, andthey followed him all the more. Men fought for the chance to serve him,even as those whose lives depended on that other man made free to render his life difficult… I could not understand it, Miss Granger.” ProfessorQuirrell’s face was in shadow, as he looked upward. “Perhaps, by takingon himself the curse of action, that man removed it from all others? Wasthat why they felt free to hinder his battle against the Dark Wizard whowould have enslaved them all? Believing men would act in their own interest was not cynicism, it turned out, but sheerest optimism; in realitymen do not meet so high a standard. And so in time that one realized hemight do better fighting the Dark Wizard alone, than with such followersat his back.”“So—” Hermione’s voice sounded strange in the night. “You left yourfriends behind where they’d be safe, and tried to attack the Dark Wizardall by yourself?”“Why, no,” said Professor Quirrell. “I stopped trying to be a hero, andwent off to do something else I found more pleasant.”“What?” said Hermione without thinking at all. “That’s horrible!”The Defense Professor turned his head down from the sky to regardher; and she saw, in the light of the doorway, that he was smiling—or atleast half his face was smiling. “Are you going to tell me, Miss Granger,that I am an awful person? Well, perhaps I am. But then are people whonever even try to be heroes still worse? If I had never done anything at all,like them, would you have thought better of me?”Hermione opened her mouth and then found that, once again, shedidn’t have anything to say. It wasn’t right to walk away from being ahero, you couldn’t just do that, but she didn’t want to say that everyonewho wasn’t a hero was nothing, that was Quirrell-thinking…The smile, or half-smile, had disappeared. “You were foolish,” the Defense Professor said quietly, “to expect any lasting gratitude from thoseyou tried to protect, once you named yourself a heroine. Just as you expected that man to go on being a hero, and called him horrible for stopping, when a thousand others never lifted a finger. It was only expectedthat you should fight bullies. It was a tax you owed, and they accepted itlike princes, with a sneer for the lateness of your payment. And you havealready witnessed, I wager, that their fondness vanished like dust in thewind once it was no longer in their interest to associate with you…”The Defense Professor slowly straightened off the balcony, standingalmost straight, turning to regard her fully.“But you don’t have to be a hero, Miss Granger,” said Professor Quirrell. “You can stop anytime you please.”That idea……had occurred to her before, several times over the last two days.People become who they are meant to be, by doing what is right, HeadmasterDumbledore had told her. The trouble was that there seemed to be twodifferent right things to do. There was the part of her which said thatright was to go on being a heroine, and stay at Hogwarts, she didn’t knowwhat was going on but a heroine wouldn’t just run away.And there was also the voice of common sense saying that young children shouldn’t ever stay around danger, that was what adults were for;the voice of every school poster that said not to take candy from strangers.That was also right.Hermione Granger stood there on that balcony, looking at ProfessorQuirrell silhouetted by the emerging stars, and she didn’t understand;she didn’t understand how the Defense Professor could be gazing at herwith his face showing concern; she didn’t understand the notes of painin the Defense Professor’s voice that caught at her; she didn’t understandwhy she was being told all this.“You don’t even like me, Professor,” said Hermione.A small smile flickered on Professor Quirrell’s face. “I suppose I couldgo on about how I am angered that this affair has taken up my valuabletime and disrupted my Defense classes. But mostly, Miss Granger, youare my student, and whatever other professions I may have once held,I think I have been a good teacher at Hogwarts, have I not?” SuddenlyProfessor Quirrell’s eyes seemed very tired. “As your teacher, then, I amadvising you that you have other career options. I should not like to seeanyone else going down my path.”Hermione swallowed. It was a side of Professor Quirrell she’d neverseen or imagined, and it was eating away at her preconceptions.Professor Quirrell watched her for a moment, and then looked awayfrom her again, back up at the stars. When he spoke this time his voicewas quieter. “Someone here is targeting you, Miss Granger, and I cannotward you as I warded Mr. Malfoy. The Headmaster has prevented it, forwhat he claims to be good reasons. It is easy to become fond of Hogwarts,I know, for I am fond of it as well. But in France they take a differentview of the Ancient Houses than in Britain; and Beauxbatons would notmistreat you, I think. Whatever else you imagine of me, I swear that if youasked me to see you safely in Beauxbatons, I would do all in my power toconvey you there.”“I can’t just—” Hermione said.“But you can, Miss Granger.” Now the pale blue eyes watched her intently. “Whatever you wish to make of your life, you cannot attain it atHogwarts, not anymore. This place is ruined for you now, even leavingaside all other threats. Simply ask Harry Potter to command you to go toBeauxbatons and live out your life in peace. If you stay here, he is yourmaster in the eyes of Britain and its laws!”She hadn’t even been thinking about that, it paled so much in compar*1371 *ison to being eaten by Dementors; it had been important to her before,but now it all seemed childish, unimportant, pointless, so why were hereyes burning?“And if that fails to move you, Miss Granger, consider also thatMr. Potter has, just today at lunchtime, threatened Lucius Malfoy, Albus Dumbledore, and the entire Wizengamot because he cannot thinksensibly when something threatens to take you from him. Are you notfrightened of what he will do next?”It made sense. Terrible sense. Dreadful awful sense.It made too much sense—She couldn’t have described it in words, what triggered the realization, unless it was the sheer pressure that the Defense Professor was exerting on her.That if the Defense Professor was behind this whole thing—then Professor Quirrell had done it all just to get her out of the way of his plans forHarry.Without any conscious decision, she shifted her weight to the otherfoot, her body moving away from the Defense Professor—“So you think I am the one responsible?” said Professor Quirrell. Hisvoice sounded a little sad as he said it, and her own heart almost stoppedfrom hearing it. “I suppose I cannot blame you. I am the Defense Professor of Hogwarts, after all. But Miss Granger, even assuming that I amyour enemy, common sense should still tell you to get away from me veryquickly. You cannot use the Killing Curse, so the correct tactic is to Apparate away. I do not mind being the villain of your imagination if it makesmatters clearer. Leave Hogwarts, and leave me to those who can handleme. I will arrange for the transportation to be through some family ofgood repute, and Mr. Potter will know to blame me if you do not arrivesafely.”“I—” She was feeling cold, the night air chilling her skin, or maybebeing chilled by it. “I’ve got to think about it—”Professor Quirrell shook his head. “No, Miss Granger. Your departure will take time for me to arrange, and I have less time left than youmay think. This decision may be painful for you, but it should not be am* 1372 *biguous; much weighs in the balance of these scales, but not evenly. Imust know tonight whether you intend to go.”And if not—Was the Defense Professor warning her deliberately? That if shedidn’t run, he would strike again?Why would it matter so much, what did Professor Quirrell want to dowith Harry?Hermione Granger, I shall be less subtle than is usual for a mysterious oldwizard, and tell you outright that you cannot imagine how badly things could goif the events surrounding Harry Potter turn to ill.The most powerful wizard in the world had told her that, when he wastalking about how important it was that she not stop being Harry’s friend.Hermione swallowed, she swayed a little where she stood, on thestone balcony of a magical castle. Suddenly the whole deadly absurdityof the situation seemed to rise up and grab her by the throat, that twelveyear-old girls shouldn’t be in danger, shouldn’t be thinking about suchthings, that Mum would want her to RUN AWAY and her father wouldhave a heart attack if he even knew she was being faced with the question.And she knew, then, as Harry and Dumbledore had both tried to warnher, that everything she’d ever thought about being a heroine had beenmistaken. That there wasn’t really any such thing as heroes, outside ofstories. There was just horrible danger, and being arrested by Aurors andput in cells next to Dementors, pain and fear and—“Miss Granger?” said the Defense Professor.She said nothing. All the words were blocked in her throat.“I need a decision, Miss Granger.”She kept her jaw locked, didn’t let any words come out.Finally the Defense Professor sighed. Slowly the white light failed,and slowly the door behind him swung open, so that he was once againa black silhouette against the opening. “Good night, Miss Granger,” hesaid, and turned his back to her, and walked away into Hogwarts.It took a while for her breathing to slow down again. Whatever hadhappened here tonight, it didn’t feel anything like victory. She’d foughtso hard just to stop herself from saying Yes in the face of the Defense Pro* 1373 *fessor’s pressure, and now she didn’t even know if she’d done the rightthing.When she walked back into the light herself (after exhaustion hadovertaken everything and sleep was once more a possibility), she thoughtshe heard it as she was within the doorway, from behind her and aboveher, a distant cawing cry.But it wasn’t meant for her, she knew, so she started climbing up thestairs toward her dorm room.The other girls were probably asleep by now, and wouldn’t look at her,or look away—She felt the tears start, and this time she didn’t stop them.low and hard, the long stairway that led to the peak of Ravenclaw.From the inside, the stairway seemed like a straight upward slope,though from the outside you could see that it logically had to be a spiral.You could only get to the top of the Ravenclaw tower by making thatlong climb without shortcuts, stone step by stone step; passing beneathHarry’s shoes, pushed down by his wearying legs.Harry had seen Hermione safely off to bed.He had lingered in the Ravenclaw common room long enough tocollect a few signatures that might be useful to Hermione later. Notmany students had signed; wizards hadn’t been trained to think in theput-up-or-shut-up, stick-your-neck-out-and-make-a-prediction-or-stoppretending-to-believe-in-your- theory rules of Muggle science. Most ofthem hadn’t seen anything incongruent about being too nervous to signan agreement saying that Hermione got to hold it over them for the restof their lives if they were wrong, while acting outwardly confident thatshe was guilty. But just having demanded the signatures would make thepoint after the truth came out, if anyone ever again suspected Hermioneof anything Dark. She wouldn’t have to go through this twice, at least.After that Harry had left the common room quickly, because all thekindly forgiving sentiments he’d reasoned out were getting harder andharder to remember. Sometimes Harry thought the deepest split in hispersonality wasn’t anything to do with his dark side; rather it was the divide between the altruistic and forgiving Abstract Reasoning Harry, versus the frustrated and angry Harry In The Moment.The circular platform at the top of the Ravenclaw tower wasn’t thetallest place in Hogwarts, but the Ravenclaw tower jutted out from themain body of the castle, so you couldn’t see down into the top platformfrom the Astronomy tower. A quiet place to think, if you had an awful lotto think about. A place where few other students ever came—there wereeasier niches of privacy, if privacy was all you wanted.The night-lit torches of Hogwarts were far below. The platform itselfoffered few obstructions; the stairs emerged from an uncovered gap inthe floor, rather than an upright door. From this place, then, the starswere as visible as they ever were on Earth.The boy lay down in the center of the platform, heedless of his robesthat might be dirtied, dropping his head to rest upon the rock-tiled floor;so that, except for a few half-seen crenellations of stone at vision’s edge,and a sliver of crescent moon, reality became starlight.The pinpoints of light in dark velvet twinkled, wavering and returning, a different kind of beauty from their steady brilliance in the SilentNight.Harry gazed out abstractly, his mind on other things.This day your war against Voldemort has begun…Dumbledore had said that, after the Incident with Rescuing Bellatrixfrom Azkaban. That had been a false alarm, but the phrase expressed thesentiment well.Two nights ago his war had begun, and Harry didn’t know with who.Dumbledore thought it was Lord Voldemort, returned from the dead,making his first move against the boy who had defeated him last time.Professor Quirrell had put detection wards on Draco, fearing thatHogwarts’s mad Headmaster would try to frame Harry for the death ofLucius’s son.Or Professor Quirrell had set up the entire thing, and that was howhe’d known where to find Draco. Severus Snape thought the HogwartsDefense Professor was an obvious suspect, even the obvious suspect.And Severus Snape himself might or might not be even remotely trustworthy.Someone had declared war against Harry, their first strike had beenmeant to take out Draco and Hermione both, and it was only by the barestof margins that Harry had saved Hermione.You couldn’t call it victory. Draco had been removed from Hogwarts,and if that wasn’t death, it wasn’t clear how it could be undone, or whatshape Draco might be in when he got back. The country of magicalBritain now thought Hermione an attempted-murderer, which mightor might not make her decide to do the sane thing and leave. Harry hadsacrificed his entire fortune to undo his loss, and that card could only beplayed once.Some unknown power had struck at him, and if that blow had beenpartially deflected, it had still hit really hard.At least his dark side hadn’t asked anything of him in exchange forsaving Hermione. Maybe because his dark side wasn’t an imaginary voicelike Hufflepuff; Harry might imagine his Hufflepuff part as wanting different things from himself, but his dark side wasn’t like that. His “darkside”, so far as Harry could tell, was a different way that Harry sometimeswas. Right now, Harry wasn’t angry; and trying to ask what “dark Harry”wanted was a phone ringing unanswered. The thought even seemed a little strange; could you owe something to a different way you sometimeswere?Harry stared up at the random stars, the scattered twinkling lightsthat human brains couldn’t help but pattern-match into imaginary constellations.And then there was that promise Harry had sworn.Draco to help Harry reform Slytherin House. And Harry to take as anenemy whomever Harry believed, in his best judgment as a rationalist, tohave killed Narcissa Malfoy. If Narcissa had never gotten her own handsdirty, if indeed she’d been burned alive, if the killer hadn’t been tricked—those were all the conditions Harry could remember making. He probably should’ve written it down, or better yet, never made a promise requiring that many caveats in the first place.There were plausible outs, for the sort of person who’d let themselvesrationalize an out. Dumbledore hadn’t actually confessed. He hadn’tcome right out and said he’d done it. There were plausible reasons for anactually-guilty Dumbledore to behave that way. But it was also what you’dexpect to see, if someone else had burned Narcissa, and Dumbledore hadtaken credit.Harry shook his head, flattening one side of his hair and then anotheragainst the stone-tiled floor. There was still a final out, Draco could stillrelease him from the oath at any time. He could, at least, describe the situation to Draco, and talk about options with him, when they met again. Itdidn’t seem like a very likely prospect for release—but the idea of talkingsomething over honestly was enough to satisfy the part of himself that demanded adherence to oaths. Even if it only meant delaying, it was betterthan taking a good man as an enemy.But is Dumbledore a good man? asked the voice of Hufflepuff. If Dumbledore burned someone alive—wasn’t the whole point that good people may kill,but never kill with suffering?Maybe he killed her instantly, said Slytherin, and then lied to Lucius aboutthe burning-alive part. But… if there was any possibility of the Death Eaters magically verifying how Narcissa died… and if being caught in a lie would’ve endangered Light-side families…Be careful what we cleverly rationalize, warned Gryffindor.You have to expect reputational effects on how other people treat you, saidHufflepuff. If you decide there’s sufficient reason to burn a woman alive, one ofthe predictable side effects is that good people decide you’ve crossed the line andhave to be stopped. Dumbledore should’ve expected that. He’s got no right to complain.Or maybe he expects us to be smarter, said Slytherin. Now that we knowthis much of the truth—no matter the exact details of the full story—can we reallybelieve that Dumbledore is a terrible, terrible person who ought to be our enemy?In the middle of a horrible bloody war, Dumbledore set one enemy civilian onfire? That’s only bad by the standards of comic books, not by any sort of realistichistorical standard.Harry stared up at the night sky, remembering history.In real life, in real wars…During World War II, there had been a project to sabotage the Nazinuclear weapons program. Years earlier, Leo Szilard, the first person torealize the possibility of a fission chain reaction, had convinced Ferminot to publish the discovery that purified graphite was a cheap and effective neutron moderator. Fermi had wanted to publish, for the sake of thegreat international project of science, which was above nationalism. ButSzilard had persuaded Rabi, and Fermi had abided by the majority vote oftheir tiny three-person conspiracy. And so, years later, the only neutronmoderator the Nazis had known about was deuterium.The only deuterium source under Nazi control had been a capturedfacility in occupied Norway, which had been knocked out by bombs andsabotage, causing a total of twenty-four civilian deaths.The Nazis had tried to ship the deuterium already refined to Germany,aboard a civilian Norwegian ferry, the SS Hydro.Knut Haukelid and his assistants had been discovered by the nightwatchman of the civilian ferry while they were sneaking on board to sabotage it. Haukelid had told the watchman that they were escaping theGestapo, and the watchman had let them go. Haukelid had consideredwarning the night watchman, but that would have endangered the mission, so Haukelid had only shaken his hand. And the civilian ship hadsunk in the deepest part of the lake, with eight dead Germans, seven deadcrew, and three dead civilian bystanders. Some of the Norwegian rescuers of the ship had thought the German soldiers present should be leftto drown, but this view had not prevailed, and the German survivors hadbeen rescued. And that had been the end of the Nazi nuclear weaponsprogram.Which was to say that Knut Haukelid had killed innocent people. Oneof whom, the night watchman of the ship, had been a good person. Someone who’d gone out of his way to help Haukelid, at risk to himself; fromthe kindness of his heart, for the highest moral reasons; and been sent todrown in turn. Afterward, in the cold light of history, it had looked likethe Nazis had never been close to getting nuclear weapons after all.And Harry had never read anything suggesting that Haukelid hadacted wrongly.That was war in real life. In terms of total damage and who’d gottenhit, what Haukelid had done was considerably worse than what Dumbledore might have done to Narcissa Malfoy, or what Dumbledore had possibly done to leak the prophecy to Lord Voldemort to get him to attackHarry’s parents.If Haukelid had been a comic-book superhero, he’d have somehowgotten all the civilians off the ferry, he would’ve attacked the German soldiers directly……rather than let a single innocent person die……but Knut Haukelid hadn’t been a superhero.And neither had been Albus Dumbledore.Harry closed his eyes, swallowing hard a few times against the suddenchoking sensation. It was abruptly very clear that while Harry was goingaround trying to live the ideals of the Enlightenment, Dumbledore wasthe one who’d actually fought in a war. Nonviolent ideals were cheap tohold if you were a scientist, living inside the Protego bubble cast by the police officers and soldiers whose actions you had the luxury to question. Albus Dumbledore seemed to have started out with ideals at least as strongas Harry’s own, if not stronger; and Dumbledore hadn’t gotten throughhis war without killing enemies and sacrificing friends.Are you so much better than Haukelid and Dumbledore, Harry Potter, thatyou’ll be able to fight without a single casualty? Even in the world of comic books,the only reason a superhero like Batman even looks successful is that the comicbook readers only notice when Important Named Characters die, not when theJoker shoots some random nameless bystander to show off his villainy. Batmanis a murderer no less than the Joker, for all the lives the Joker took that Batmancould’ve saved by killing him. That’s what the man named Alastor was tryingto tell Dumbledore, and afterward Dumbledore regretted having taken so long tochange his mind. Are you really going to try to follow the path of the superhero,and never sacrifice a single piece or kill a single enemy?Fatigued, Harry turned his attention away from the dilemma for amoment, opened his eyes again to regard the hemisphere of night, whichrequired no decisions from him.Near the edge of his vision, the pale white crescent of the Moon, thelight from which had left one-and-a-quarter seconds ago, around 375,000kilometers of distance in Earth’s space of simultaneity.Above and to the side, Polaris, the North Star; the first star Harry hadlearned to identify in the sky, by following the edge of the Big Dipper.That was actually a five-star system with a brilliant central supergiant,434 light-years from Earth. It was the first ‘star’ whose name Harry hadever learned from his father, so long ago that he couldn’t have guessedhow old he’d been.The dim fog that was the Milky Way, so many billions of distant starsthat they became an indistinct river, the plane of a galaxy that stretched100,000 light-years across. If Harry had experienced any sense of wonderwhen he’d first been told that, he’d been too young for him to remembernow that first time, across a few years’ distance.In the center of the constellation Andromeda, the star Andromeda,which was really the Andromeda Galaxy. The nearest galaxy to the MilkyWay, 2.4 million light-years away, containing an estimated trillion stars.Numbers like those made ‘infinity’ pale by comparison, because ‘infinity’ was just featureless and blank. Thinking that the stars were ‘infinitely’ distant was a lot less scary than trying to work out what 2.4 million light-years amounted to in meters. 2.4 million light-years, times 31million seconds in a year, times a photon moving at 300,000,000 metersper second…It was strange to think that such distances might not be unreachablyfar away. Magic was loose in the universe, things like Time-Turnersand broomsticks. Had any wizard ever tried to measure the speed of aportkey, or a phoenix?And the human understanding of magic couldn’t possibly be anywhere near the underlying laws. What would you be able to do withmagic if you really understood it?A year ago, Dad had gone to the Australian National University inCanberra for a conference where he’d been an invited speaker, andhe’d taken Mum and Harry along. And they’d all visited the NationalMuseum of Australia, because, it had turned out, there was basicallynothing else to do in Canberra. The glass display cases had shownrock-throwers crafted by the Australian aborigines—like giant woodenshoehorns, they’d looked, but smoothed and carved and ornamentedwith painstaking care. In the 40,000 years since anatomically modern1381 *humans had migrated to Australia from Asia, nobody had invented thebow-and-arrow. It really made you appreciate how non-obvious was theidea of Progress. Why would you even think of Invention as somethingimportant, if all your history’s heroic tales were of great warriors anddefenders instead of Thomas Edison? How could anyone have suspected,while carving a rock-thrower with painstaking care, that someday humanbeings would invent rocket ships and nuclear energy?Could you have looked up into the sky, at the brilliant light of the Sun,and deduced that the universe contained greater sources of power thanmere fire? Would you have realized that if the fundamental physical lawspermitted it, someday humans would tap the same energies as the Sun?Even if nothing you could imagine doing with rock-throwers or wovenpouches—no pattern of running across the savannah and nothing youcould obtain by hunting animals—would accomplish that even in imagination?It wasn’t like modern-day Muggles had gotten anywhere near thelimits of what Muggle physics said was possible. And yet like huntergatherers conceptually bound to their rock-throwers, most Muggleslived in a world defined by the limits of what you could do with cars andtelephones. Even though Muggle physics explicitly permitted possibilities like molecular nanotechnology or the Penrose process for extractingenergy from black holes, most people filed that away in the same sectionof their brain that stored fairy tales and history books, well away fromtheir personal realities: Long ago and far away, ever so long ago. No surprise,then, that the wizarding world lived in a conceptual universe bounded—not by fundamental laws of magic that nobody even knew—but just bythe surface rules of known Charms and enchantments. You couldn’t observe the way magic was practiced nowadays and not be reminded of theNational Museum of Australia, once you realized what you were seeing.Even if Harry’s first guess had been mistaken, one way or another it wasstill inconceivable that the fundamental laws of the universe containeda special case for human lips shaping the phrase ‘Wingardium Leviosa’.And yet even that fumbling grasp of magic was enough to do things thatMuggle physics said should be forever impossible: the Time-Turner, waterconjured out of nothingness by Aguamenti. What were the ultimate pos* 1382 *sibilities of invention, if the underlying laws of the universe permittedan eleven-year-old with a stick to violate almost every constraint in theMuggle version of physics?Like a hunter-gatherer trying to look up at the Sun, and guess that theuniverse had to be shaped in a way that allowed for nuclear energy…It made you wonder if maybe twenty thousand million million millionmeters wasn’t so much distance, after all.There was a step beyond Abstract Reasoning Harry which he couldtake, given time enough to compose himself and the right surroundings;something beyond Abstract Reasoning Harry, as that was beyond HarryIn The Moment. Looking up at the stars, you could try to imagine whatthe distant descendants of humanity would think of your dilemma—ina hundred million years, when the stars would have spun through greatgalactic movements into entirely new positions, every constellation scattered. It was an elementary theorem of probability that if you knew whatyour answer would be after updating on future evidence, you ought toadopt that answer right now. If you knew your destination, you were already there. And by analogy, if not quite by theorem, if you could guesswhat the descendants of humanity would think of something, you oughtto go ahead and take that as your own best guess.From that vantage point the idea of killing off two-thirds of the Wizengamot seemed a lot less appealing than it had a few hours earlier.Even if you had to do it, even if you knew for a solid fact that it would bethe best thing for magical Britain and that the complete Story of Timewould look worse if you didn’t do it… even as a necessity, the deathsof sentient beings would still be a tragedy. One more element of thesorrows of Earth; the Most Ancient Earth from which everything hadbegun, long ago and far away, ever so long ago.He is not like Grindelwald. There is nothing human left in him. Him youmust destroy. Save your fury for that, and that alone—Harry shook his head slightly, tilting the stars a little in his vision,as he lay on the stone floor looking upward and outward and forwardin time. Even if Dumbledore was right, and the true enemy was utterlymad and evil… in a hundred million years the organic lifeform knownas Lord Voldemort probably wouldn’t seem much different from all theother bewildered children of Ancient Earth. Whatever Lord Voldemorthad done to himself, whatever Dark rituals seemed so horribly irrevocable on a merely human scale, it wouldn’t be beyond curing with the technology of a hundred million years. Killing him, even if you had to do it tosave the lives of others, would be just one more death for future sentientbeings to be sad about. How could you look up at the stars, and believeanything else?Harry stared up at the twinkling lights of Eternity and wondered whatthe children’s children’s children would think of what Dumbledore hadmaybe-done to Narcissa.But even if you tried framing the question that way, asking whathumanity’s descendants would think, it still drew only on your ownknowledge, not theirs. The answer still came from inside yourself, andit could still be mistaken. If you didn’t know the hundredth decimaldigit of pi yourself, then you didn’t know how the children’s children’schildren would calculate it, for all that the fact was trivial.Slowly—he’d been lying there, looking at the stars, for longer than he’dplanned—Harry sat up from the ground. Pushing himself to his feet, themuscles protesting, he walked over to the edge of the stone platform atthe height of the Ravenclaw tower. The stone crenellations surroundingthe edge of the tower weren’t high, not high enough to be safe. They weremarkers, clearly, rather than railings. Harry didn’t approach too closeto the edge; there was no point in taking chances. Looking down at theHogwarts grounds below, he was predictably feeling a sense of dizziness,the wobbly affliction called vertigo. His brain was alarmed, it seemed, because the ground below was so distant. It might have been fully 50 metersaway.The lesson, it seemed, was that things had to be incredibly close by before your brain could comprehend them well enough to feel fear.It was a rare brain that could feel strongly about anything, if it wasn’tclose in space, close in time, near at hand, within easy reach…Before, Harry had imagined that going to Azkaban would requireplanning and cooperation from a grownup confederate. Portkeys,broomsticks, invisibility spells. Some way of getting to the bottom levelswithout the Aurors noticing, so he could carve his way into the centralpit where the shadows of Death waited.And that had been enough to put the prospect away, into the future,safely apart from the now.He hadn’t realized until today that it might be as simple as findingFawkes and telling the phoenix that it was time.Memories were rising up again, memories that Harry could nevermanage to forget for long. Though the stones beneath his feet were notsmooth like metal, though the moonlit sky stretched all around him,somehow it was very easy to imagine himself trapped in a long metalcorridor lit by dim orange light.The night was quiet, quiet enough for memories to be clearly audible.No, I didn’t mean it, please don’t die!No, I didn’t mean it, please don’t die!Don’t take it away, don’t don’t don’t—The world blurred, and Harry wiped his eyes with his sleeve.If Hermione had been the one behind that door—If Hermione had been put in Azkaban, Harry would have called thephoenix and gone there and burned away every last Dementor and itwouldn’t have made a single difference how crazy it was or what else he’dwanted to do with his life. That was just—that was—that was just how itwas.And the woman who was behind that door—wasn’t there someone,somewhere, to whom she too was precious? Wasn’t it only Harry’s distance from her life that was preventing his brain from being driven toAzkaban to save her no matter what? What would it have taken to compelhim? Would he have needed to know her face? Her name? Her favoritecolor? Would he have been driven to Azkaban to save Tracey Davis?Would he have been compelled there to save Professor McGonagall?Mum and Dad—there wasn’t even any question. And that woman hadsaid she was someone’s mother. How many people had wished for thepower to break Azkaban? How many prisoners of Azkaban dreamednightly of such a miraculous rescue?None. It’s a happy thought.Maybe he should harrow Azkaban. All he had to do was find Fawkesand tell him it was time. Visualize the center of the Dementor’s pit as he’dseen it from the broomstick, and let the phoenix take him there. Cast theTrue Patronus Charm at point-blank range and to hell with what cameafter.All he had to do was go find Fawkes.It might be as simple as thinking of the flame, calling for the fire-birdin his heart—A star flashed in the night.By the time Harry’s eyes had jumped with a reflex action trained onmeteor showers, another part of him was surprised that the astronomicalphenomenon was still there; a faint star whose brightness was slowly visibly waxing. There was a startled moment when Harry wondered whetherhe was seeing, not a meteor, but a nova or supernova—could you see themgetting brighter like that? Was the first stage of a nova supposed to bethat yellow-orange color?Then the new star moved again, and seemed to grow as well as brightening. It looked closer suddenly, no longer so far away that distance became moot. Like what you thought was a star, turning out to be an airplane, a lighted form whose shape you could actually see……no, not a plane…The realization seemed to spread out from Harry’s chest in a wave ofprickling, sweat preparing to break out.…a bird.A piercing cry split the night, echoing from the rooftops of Hogwarts.The approaching creature trailed fire as it flew, shedding goldenflames like sparks from its feathers as the mighty wings beat and beatagain. Even as it swooped up in a great curve to hover a few paces awayfrom Harry, even as the flames surrounding its passage diminished, thecreature seemed no dimmer, no less bright; as though some unseen Sunshone upon it and illuminated it.Great shining wings red like a sunset, and eyes like incandescentpearls, blazing with golden fire and determination.The phoenix’s beak opened, and let out a great caw that Harry understood as though it had been a spoken word:Not even realizing, the boy stumbled back from the edge of therooftop, eyes still locked on the phoenix, his whole body tremblingand tensed, his fists clutching and releasing at his side; stepping back,stepping away.The phoenix cawed again, a desperate, pleading, sound. It didn’tcome through in words, this time, but it came through in feelings, anecho of everything that Harry had ever felt about Azkaban and everytemptation to action, to just do something about it, the desperate needto do something now and not delay any longer, all spoken in the cry of abird.Let’s go. It’s time. The voice that spoke came from inside Harry, notfrom the phoenix; from so deep inside it couldn’t be given a separatename like ‘Gryffindor’.All he had to do was step forward and touch the phoenix’s talons, andit would take him where he needed to be, where he kept thinking he oughtto be, down into the central pit of Azkaban. Harry could see the image inhis mind, shining with unbearable clarity, the image of himself suddenlysmiling with joyous release as he threw all his fears away and chose—“But I—” Harry whispered, not even aware of what he was saying.Harry lifted his shaking hands to wipe at his eyes from which tears hadsprung, as the phoenix hovered before him with great wing-sweeps. “ButI—there’s other people I also have to save, other things I have to do—”The fire-bird let out a piercing scream, and the boy flinched back asthough from a blow. It wasn’t a command, it wasn’t an objection, it wasthe knowledge—The corridors lit by dim orange light.It felt like a tightening compulsion in Harry’s chest, the desire to justdo it and get it over with. He might die, but if he didn’t die he could feelclean again. Have principles that were more than excuses for inaction. Itwas his life. His to spend, if he chose. He could do it any time he wanted……if he wasn’t a good person.The boy stood there on the rooftop, his own eyes locked with two pointsof fire. The stars might have had time to shift in their constellations whilehe stood there, agonizing over the decision……that wouldn’t……change.The boy’s eyes flickered once to the stars above; and then he looked atthe phoenix.“Not yet,” the boy said in a voice hardly audible. “Not yet. There’s toomuch else I have to do. Please come back later, when I’ve found otherswho can cast the True Patronus—in six months, maybe—”Without word, without sound, a sphere of fire surrounded the bird’sform, crackling and blazing with white and crimson veins as though itmeant to consume that which lay within; and when the fire dispersed intogrey smoke, no phoenix remained.There was silence on the top of the Ravenclaw tower. The boy gradually lowered his hands from his ears, pausing only to wipe at his wetcheeks.Slowly, the boy turned—Then cried out and leapt back and almost fell off the Ravenclaw tower;though the misstep would hardly have mattered, with that other wizardstanding there.“And so it was done,” Albus Dumbledore said, almost in a whisper.“So it was done.” Fawkes was on his shoulder, staring at where the otherphoenix had been with an indecipherable avian gaze.“What are you doing here?”“Ah?” said the ancient man standing on the roof-platform’s oppositecorner. “I felt the presence of a creature Hogwarts did not know, andcame to see, of course.” Slowly the old wizard’s shaking hand came upto remove the half-moon glasses, his other hand wiped at his eyes andforehead with his robe’s sleeve. “I dared—I dared not speak—I knew, Iknew this choice above all choices must be your own—”A strange apprehension was beginning to fill Harry, welling up in himlike a sick feeling in his stomach.“That everything depended on this,” Albus Dumbledore said, still inthat almost-whisper, “that much I knew. But which choice led into darkness, that I could not guess. At least the choice was your own.”“I don’t—” Harry said, and then his voice stopped.A terrible hypothesis, rising in credibility…“The phoenix comes,” said the old wizard. “To those who wouldfight, to those would act even at cost of their lives, the phoenix comes.Phoenixes are not wise, Harry, they know no means to judge us, savewitnessing the choice. I thought it was to my death I went, when thephoenix took me to fight Grindelwald. I did not know that Fawkes wouldsustain me, and heal me, and stay by my side—” The old wizard’s voicequavered, for a moment. “It is not spoken of—you should realize, Harry,why it is never spoken of—if the one knew, the phoenix could not judge.But to you, Harry, I may say it now, for the phoenix comes only once.”The old wizard walked across the top of the Ravenclaw tower to wherea boy stood rooted in dawning horror, in dawning and utter horror.In my duel with Grindelwald I could not win, only fight him for long hoursuntil he collapsed in exhaustion; and I would have died of it afterward, if not forFawkes—Harry didn’t even know he was speaking, until the whisper had escaped him—“Then I could have—”“Could you have?” said the ancient wizard, his voice sounding farolder than his normal tones. “Three times, now, a phoenix has come formy student. One did send hers away, and the grief of it broke her, I think.And the last was cousin to your young friend Lavender Brown, and he—”The old wizard’s voice cracked. “He did not return, did poor John, andhe saved none of those he meant to save. It is said, among the few scholars of phoenix-lore, that not one in four returns from their ordeal. Andeven if you did survive—for the life you must lead, Harry James PotterEvans-Verres—the choices you must make and the path you must walk—to always hear the phoenix’s cries—who is to say it would not have drivenyou mad?” The old wizard raised his sleeve again, drawing it once moreacross his face. “I had more joy of Fawkes’s companionship, in the daysbefore I fought Voldemort.”The boy did not seem to be listening, all his eyes were on the red-goldbird on the ancient wizard’s shoulder. “Fawkes?” the boy said in shakingvoice. “Why won’t you look at me, Fawkes?”Fawkes craned his head to peer at the boy curiously, then turned backand resumed gazing at his master.“See?” said the old wizard. “He does not reject you. Fawkes may notbe interested in you in quite that way, now; and he knows—” the wizardsmiled wryly, “—that you are not exactly loyal to his master. But one towhom the phoenix comes at all—cannot be one whom a phoenix woulddislike.” The wizard’s voice fell to a whisper again. “There never was abird seen on Godric Gryffindor’s shoulder. Though it is not written evenin his secrets, I think he must have sent his phoenix away, before he chosethe red and gold for his colors. Perhaps the guilt of it urged him to greaterlengths than he ever would have dared otherwise. Or it might have taughthim humility, and respect for human frailty, and failure…” The wizardbowed his head. “I truly do not know if your choice was wise. I truly donot know if it was the right thing, or the wrong thing. If I knew, Harry,I would have spoken. But I—” Dumbledore’s voice broke, then. “I amnothing but a foolish young boy who has become a foolish old man, andI have no wisdom.”Harry couldn’t breathe, the nausea seeming to fill and overflow hiswhole body, stomach locked solid. He was suddenly and terribly certainthat he had failed, in some final sense failed, failed this very night—The boy whirled and ran out to the curb of the Ravenclaw rooftop.“Come back!” His voice cracked, rising to a shriek. “Come back!”Final Aftermath:She came awake with a gasp of horror, she woke with an unvoicedscream on her lips and no words came forth, she could not understandwhat she had seen, she could not understand what she had seen—“What time is it?” she whispered.Her golden jeweled alarm clock whispered back, “Around eleven atnight. Go back to sleep.”Her sheets were soaked in sweat, her nightclothes soaked in sweat,she took her wand from beside the pillow and cleaned herself up beforeshe tried to go back to sleep and eventually succeeded.Sybill Trelawney went back to sleep.In the Forbidden Forest, a centaur woken by a nameless apprehension ceased scanning the night sky, having found only questions thereand no answers; and with a folding of his many legs, Firenze went backto sleep.In the distant lands of magical Asia, an ancient witch named FanTong, sleeping the tired days away, told her anxious great-greatgrandson that she was fine, it had only been a nightmare, and wentback to sleep.In a land where Muggleborns received no letters of any kind, a girlchild too young to have a name of her own was rocked in the arms of herannoyed but loving mother until she stopped crying and went back tosleep.None of them slept well.1391 *(International news headlines of April 7th, 1992:)Toronto Magical Tribune:Entire British WizengamotReports Seeing ‘Boy-Who-Lived’Frighten a DementorExpert on Magical Creatures:“Now You’re Just Lying”France, Germany Accuse Britainof Making the Whole Thing UpNew Zealand Spellcrafter’s Diurnal Notice:What Drove British Legislature Insane?Could Our Government Be Next?Experts List Top 28 ReasonsTo Believe It’s Already HappenedAmerican Mage:Werewolf Clan to BecomeFirst Inhabitants of WyomingThe Quibbler:Malfoy Flees HogwartsAs Veela Powers AwakenDaily Prophet:Legal Tricks Free“Mad Muggleborn”As Potter Threatens MinistryWith Attack on AzkabanHypothesis: Voldemort(April 8th, 1992, 7:22pm)The four of them gathered once more around the ancient desk of theHeadmaster of Hogwarts, with its drawers within drawers within drawers, wherein all the past paperwork of the Hogwarts School was stored;legend had it that Headmistress Shehla had once gotten lost in that desk,and was, in fact, still there, and wouldn’t be let out again until she gother files organized. Minerva didn’t particularly look forward to inheriting those drawers, when she inherited that desk someday—if any of themsurvived.Albus Dumbledore was seated behind his desk, looking grave andcomposed.Severus Snape was standing next to the dead Floo and its ashes, hovering ominously like the vampire that students sometimes accused himof pretending to be.Mad-Eye Moody had been meant to join them, but was yet to arrive.And Harry…A boy’s small, thin frame, perched on the arm of his chair, as thoughthe energies running through him were too great to allow ordinary seating. Set face, sweaty hair, intent green eyes, and within it all, the jaggedlightning-bolt of his never-healing scar. He seemed grimmer, now; evencompared to a single week earlier.For a moment Minerva flashed back to her trip to Diagon Alley withHarry, what seemed like ages and ages ago. There’d been this somberboy inside that Harry, somehow, even then. This wasn’t entirely her ownfault, or Albus’s fault. And yet there was something almost unbearablysad about the contrast between the young boy she’d first met, and whatmagical Britain had made of him. Harry had never had much of an ordinary childhood, she’d gathered; Harry’s adoptive parents had said toher that he’d spoken little and played less with Muggle children. It waspainful to think that Harry might have had only a few months of playing beside the other children in Hogwarts, before the war’s demands hadstripped it all away. Maybe there was another face that Harry showed tothe children his own age, when he wasn’t staring down the Wizengamot.But she couldn’t stop herself from imagining Harry Potter’s childhood asa heap of firewood, and herself and Albus feeding the wooden branches,piece by piece, into the flames.“Prophecies are strange things,” said Albus Dumbledore. The oldwizard’s eyes were half-lidded, as though in weariness. “Vague, unclear,meaning escaping like water held between loose fingers. Prophecy isever a burden, for there are no answers there, only questions.”Harry Potter was sitting tensely. “Headmaster Dumbledore,” said theboy with soft precision, “my friends are being targeted. Hermione Granger almost went to Azkaban. The war has begun, as you put it. ProfessorTrelawney’s prophecy is key information for weighing up the balance ofmy hypotheses about what’s going on. Not to mention how silly it is—and dangerous—that the Dark Lord knows the prophecy and I don’t.”Albus looked a grim question at her, and she shook her head in reply;in whatever unimaginable way Harry had discovered that Trelawney hadmade the prophecy and that the Dark Lord knew of it, he hadn’t learnedthat much from her.“Voldemort, seeking to avert that very prophecy, went to his defeat atyour hands,” the old wizard said then. “His knowledge brought him onlyharm. Ponder that carefully, Harry Potter.”“Yes, Headmaster, I do understand that. My home culture also hasa literary tradition of self-fulfilling and misinterpreted prophecies. I’llinterpret with caution, rest assured. But I’ve already guessed quite a bit.Is it safer for me to work from partial guesses?”Time passed.“Minerva,” said Albus. “If you would.”“The one…” she began. The words came falteringly to her throat; shewas no actress. She couldn’t imitate the deep, chilling tone of the original prophecy; and yet somehow that tone seemed to carry all the meaning.“The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches… born tothose who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies…”“And the Dark Lord shall mark him as his equal,” came Severus’s voice,making her jump within her chair. The Potions Master loomed tall by thefireplace. “But he shall have power the Dark Lord knows not… and either mustdestroy all but a remnant of the other, for those two different spirits cannot existin the same world.”That last line Severus spoke with so much foreboding that it chilledher bones; it was almost like listening to Sybill Trelawney.Harry was listening with a frown. “Can you repeat that?” said Harry.“The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches, born to thosewho have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month—”“Actually, hold on, can you write that down? I need to analyze thiscarefully—”This was done, with both Albus and Severus watching the parchmenthawklike, as though to make sure that no unseen hand reached in andsnatched the precious information away.“Let’s see…” Harry said. “I’m male and born on July 31st, check. I did infact vanquish the Dark Lord, check. Ambiguous pronoun in line two… butI wasn’t born yet so it’s hard to see how my parents could have thrice defied me. This scar is an obvious candidate for the mark…” Harry touchedhis forehead. “Then there’s the power the Dark Lord knows not, whichprobably refers to my scientific background—”“No,” said Severus.Harry looked at the Potions Master in surprise.Severus’s eyes were closed, his face tightened in concentration. “TheDark Lord could obtain that power by studying the same books as you,Potter. But the prophecy did not say, power the Dark Lord has not. Noreven, power the Dark Lord cannot have. She spoke of power the Dark Lordknows not… it will be something stranger to him than Muggle artifacts.Something perhaps that he cannot comprehend at all, even having seenit…”“Science is not a bag of technological tricks,” Harry said. “It’s not justthe Muggle version of a wand. It’s not even knowledge like memorizingthe periodic table. It’s a different way of thinking.”“Perhaps…” the Potions Master murmured, but his voice was skeptical.“It is hazardous,” Albus said, “to read too far into a prophecy, even ifyou have heard it yourself. They are things of exceeding frustration.”“So I see,” Harry said. His hand rose up, rubbed the scar on his forehead. “But… okay, if this is really all we know… look, I’ll just put it bluntly.How do you know that the Dark Lord actually survived?”“What?” she cried. Albus just sighed and leaned back in the vast Headmaster’s chair.“Well,” Harry said, “imagine how this prophecy sounded back whenit was made. You-Know-Who learns the prophecy, and it sounds like I’mdestined to grow up and overthrow him. That the two of us are meant tohave a final battle where either of us must destroy all but a remnant ofthe other. So You-Know-Who attacks Godric’s Hollow and immediatelygets vanquished, leaving behind some remnant which may or may notbe his disembodied soul. Maybe the Death Eaters are his remnant, orthe Dark Mark. This prophecy could already be fulfilled, is what I’m saying. Don’t get me wrong—I do realize that my interpretation soundsstretched. Trelawney’s phrasing doesn’t seem natural for describing onlythe events that historically happened on October 31st, 1981. Attacking ababy and having the spell bounce off, isn’t something you’d normally call‘the power to vanquish’. But if you think of the prophecy as being aboutseveral possible futures, only one of which was actually realized on Halloween, then the prophecy could already be complete.”“But—” Minerva blurted. “But the raid on Azkaban—”“If the Dark Lord survived, then sure, he’s the most likely suspect forthe Azkaban breakout,” Harry said reasonably. “You could even say thatthe Azkaban breakout is Bayesian evidence for the Dark Lord surviving,because an Azkaban breakout is more likely to happen in worlds wherehe’s alive than worlds where he’s dead. But it’s not strong Bayesian evidence. It’s not something that can’t possibly happen unless the Dark Lord isalive. Professor Quirrell, who didn’t start from the assumption that YouKnow-Who was still around, had no trouble thinking of his own explanation. To him, it was obvious that some powerful wizard might wantBellatrix Black because she knew a secret of the Dark Lord’s, like someof his magical knowledge that he’d told to only her. The priors againstanyone surviving their body’s death are very low, even if it’s magicallypossible. Most times it doesn’t happen. So if it’s just the Azkaban breakout… I’d have to say formally that it isn’t enough Bayesian evidence. Theimprobability of the evidence assuming that the hypothesis is false, is notcommensurate with the prior improbability of the hypothesis.”“No,” Severus said flatly. “The prophecy is not yet fulfilled. I wouldknow if it were.”“Are you sure of that?”“Yes, Potter. If the prophecy had already come true, I would understand it! I heard Trelawney’s words, I remember Trelawney’s voice, andif I knew the events that matched the prophecy, I would recognize them.What has already happened… does not fit.” The Potions Master spoke withcertainty.“I’m not really sure what to do with that statement,” Harry said. Hishand rose up, absently rubbed at his forehead. “Maybe it’s just what youthink happened that doesn’t fit, and the true history is different…”“Voldemort is alive,” Albus said. “There are other indications.”“Such as?” Harry’s reply was instant.Albus paused. “There are terrible rituals by which wizards have returned from death,” Albus said slowly. “That much, anyone can discernwithin history and legend. And yet those books are missing, I could notfind them; it was Voldemort who removed them, I am sure—”“So you can’t find any books on immortality, and that proves that YouKnow-Who has them?”“Indeed,” said Albus. “There is a certain book—I will not name italoud—missing from the Restricted Section of the Hogwarts library. Anancient scroll which should have been at Borgin and Burkes, with only anempty place on a shelf to show where it was—” The old wizard stopped.“But I suppose,” the old wizard said, as though to himself, “you will saythat even if Voldemort tried to make himself immortal, it does not provethat he succeeded…”Harry sighed. “Proof, Headmaster? There are only ever probabilities. If there are known, particular books on immortality rituals whichare missing, that increases the probability that someone attempted one.Which, in turn, raises the prior probability of the Dark Lord surviving hisdeath. This I concede, and thank you for contributing the fact. The question is whether the prior probability goes up enough.”“Surely,” Albus said quietly, “if you concede even a chance that Voldemort survived, that is worth guarding against?”Harry inclined his head. “As you say, Headmaster. Though once aprobability drops low enough, it’s also an error to go on obsessing aboutit… Given that books on immortality are missing, and that this prophecywould sound somewhat more natural if it refers to the Dark Lord and Ihaving a future battle, I agree that the Dark Lord being alive is a probability, not just possibility. But other probabilities must also be taken intoaccount—and in the probable worlds where You-Know-Who is not alive,someone else framed Hermione.”“Foolishness,” Severus said softly. “Utter foolishness. The Dark Markhas not faded, nor has its master.”“See, that’s what I mean by formally insufficient Bayesian evidence.Sure, it sounds all grim and foreboding and stuff, but is it that unlikely fora magical mark to stay around after the maker dies? Suppose the mark iscertain to continue while the Dark Lord’s sentience lives on, but a prioriwe’d only have guessed a twenty percent chance of the Dark Mark continuing to exist after the Dark Lord dies. Then the observation, ‘The DarkMark has not faded’ is five times as likely to occur in worlds where theDark Lord is alive as in worlds where the Dark Lord is dead. Is that really commensurate with the prior improbability of immortality? Let’s saythe prior odds were a hundred-to-one against the Dark Lord surviving.If a hypothesis is a hundred times as likely to be false versus true, andthen you see evidence five times more likely if the hypothesis is true versus false, you should update to believing the hypothesis is twenty timesas likely to be false as true. Odds of a hundred to one, times a likelihoodratio of one to five, equals odds of twenty to one that the Dark Lord isdead—”“Where are you getting all these numbers, Potter?”“That is the admitted weakness of the method,” Harry said readily.“But what I’m qualitatively getting at is why the observation, ‘The DarkMark has not faded’, is not adequate support for the hypothesis, ‘TheDark Lord is immortal.’ The evidence isn’t as extraordinary as the claim.”Harry paused. “Not to mention that even if the Dark Lord is alive, hedoesn’t have to be the one who framed Hermione. As a cunning manonce said, there could be more than one plotter and more than one plan.”“Such as the Defense Professor,” Severus said with a thin smile. “Isuppose I must agree that he is a suspect. It was the Defense Professorlast year, after all; and the year before that, and the year before that.”Harry’s eyes dropped back to the parchment in his lap. “Let’s moveon. Are we certain that this Prophecy is accurate? Nobody messed withProfessor McGonagall’s memory, maybe edited or subtracted a line?”Albus paused, then spoke slowly. “There is a great spell laid overBritain, recording every prophecy said within our borders. Far beneaththe Most Ancient Hall of the Wizengamot, in the Department of Mysteries, they are recorded.”“The Hall of Prophecy,” Minerva whispered. She’d read about thatplace, said to be a great room of shelves filled with glowing orbs, one afteranother appearing over the years. Merlin himself had wrought it, it wassaid; the greatest wizard’s final slap to the face of Fate. Not all propheciesconduced to the good; and Merlin had wished for at least those spoken ofin prophecy, to know what had been spoken of them. That was the respectMerlin had given to their free will, that Destiny might not control themfrom the outside, unwitting. Those mentioned within a prophecy wouldhave an glowing orb float to their hand, and then hear the prophet’s truevoice speaking. Others who tried to touch an orb, it was said, would bedriven mad—or possibly just have their heads explode, the legends wereunclear on this point. Whatever Merlin’s original intention, the Unspeakables hadn’t let anyone enter in centuries, so far as she’d heard. Works ofthe Ancient Wizards had stated that later Unspeakables had discovered thattipping off the subjects of prophecies could interfere with seers releasingwhatever temporal pressures they released; and so the heirs of Merlin hadsealed his Hall. It did occur to Minerva to wonder (now that she’d spenta few months around Mr. Potter) how anyone could possibly know that;but she also knew better than to ask Albus, in case Albus tried to tell her.Minerva firmly believed that you only ought to worry about Time if youwere a clock.“The Hall of Prophecy,” Albus confirmed lowly. “Those who are spoken of in a prophecy, may listen to that prophecy there. Do you see theimplication, Harry?”Harry frowned. “Well, I could listen to it, or the Dark Lord… oh, myparents. Those who had thrice defied him. They were also mentioned inthe prophecy, so they could hear the recording?”“If James and Lily heard anything different from what Minerva reported,” Albus said evenly, “they did not say so to me.”“You took James and Lily there?” Minerva said.“Fawkes can go to many places,” Albus said. “Do not mention the fact.”Harry was staring directly at Albus. “Can I go to this Department ofMysteries place and hear the recorded prophecy? The original tone ofvoice might be helpful, from what I’ve heard.”Light glinted from the reflection of Albus’s half-moon glasses as theold wizard slowly shook his head. “I think that would be unwise,” Albussaid. “For reasons beyond the obvious. It is dangerous, that place whichMerlin made; more dangerous to some people than others.”“I see,” Harry said tonelessly, and looked back down at the parchment.“I’ll take the prophecy as assumed accurate for now. The next part saysthat the Dark Lord has marked me as his equal. Any ideas on what thatmeans exactly?”“Surely not,” said Albus, “that you must imitate his ways, in any wise.”“I’m not dumb, Headmaster. Muggles have worked out a thing or twoabout temporal paradoxes, even if it’s all theoretical to them. I won’tthrow away my ethics just because a signal from the future claims it’sgoing to happen, because then that becomes the only reason why it happened in the first place. Still, what does it mean?”“I do not know,” said Severus.“Nor I,” she said.Harry took out his wand, turned it over in his hands, gazing meditatively at the wood. “Eleven inches, holly, with a core of phoenix feather,”Harry said. “And the phoenix whose tail feather is in this wand, only evergave one other, which Mr… what was his name, Olive-something… madeinto the core of the Dark Lord’s wand. And I’m a Parselmouth. It seemedlike a lot of coincidence even then. And now I find out there’s a prophecystating that I’ll be the Dark Lord’s equal.”Severus’s eyes were thoughtful; the Headmaster’s gaze, unreadable.“Could it be,” Minerva said falteringly, “that You-Know-Who—thatVoldemort—transferred some of his own powers to Mr. Potter, the nighthe gave him that scar? Not something he intended to do, surely. Still… Idon’t see how Mr. Potter could be his equal, if he had any less magic thanthe Dark Lord himself…”“Meh,” said Harry, still looking meditatively at his wand. “I’d fightthe Dark Lord without any magic at all, if I had to. Homo sapiens didn’tbecome the dominant species on this planet by having the sharpest clawsor hardest armor—though I suppose some of that point may be lost onwizards. Still, it’s beneath my dignity as a human being to be scared ofanything that isn’t smarter than I am; and from what I’ve heard, on thatparticular dimension the Dark Lord wasn’t very scary.”The Potions Master spoke, his voice taking on some of his customarycontemptuous drawl. “You imagine yourself more intelligent than theDark Lord, Potter?”“Yes, in fact,” said Harry, pulling back the left sleeve of his robes, androlling up the shirtsleeve beneath to expose the bare elbow. “Oh, that reminds me! Let’s make sure nobody here has the clearly visible tattoo inthe standard, easily checkable location which would mark them as a secret enemy spy.”Albus made a quieting gesture that halted the Potions Master beforehe could say anything scathing. “Tell me, Harry,” Albus said, “how wouldyou have crafted the Dark Mark?”“Nonstandard locations,” Harry said promptly, “not easily found without embarrassment and fuss, though of course any security-consciousperson would check anyway. Make it smaller, if possible. Overlay anothernon-magical tattoo to obscure the exact shape—better yet, cover it witha layer of fake skin—”“Cunning indeed,” Albus said. “But tell me, suppose you could craftany conditions you wished into the Mark, fading it or raising it as youwished. What would you do then?”“Make it completely invisible at all times,” Harry said in tones of stating the obvious. “You don’t want there to be any detectable differencebetween a spy and a non-spy.”“Suppose you are more cunning still,” Albus said. “You are a masterof trickery, a master of deception, and you employ your abilities to thefullest.”“Well—” The boy stopped, frowning. “It seems unnecessarily complicated, more like a tactic a villain would use in a role-playing game thansomething you’d try in a real-life war. But I suppose you could put fakeDark Marks on people who aren’t really Death Eaters, and keep the DarkMarks on the real Death Eaters invisible. But then there’s the questionof why people would start believing in the first place that the Dark Markidentified a Death Eater… I’d have to think about it for at least five minutes, if I were going to take the problem seriously.”“I ask you this,” Albus said, still in that mild tone, “because I did indeed, in the early days of the war, perform such tests as you suggested.The Order survived my folly only because Alastor did not trust in the barearms we saw. I had thought, afterward, that the bearers of the Markmight hide it or show it at their will. And yet when we hied Igor Karkaroffbefore the Wizengamot, that Mark showed clear on his arm, for all thatKarkaroff wished to protest his innocence. What true rule may governthe Dark Mark, I do not know. Even Severus is still bound by his Marknot to reveal its secrets to any who do not know them.”“Oh, well that makes it obvious,” Harry said promptly. “Wait, hold on—you were a Death Eater?” Harry transferred his stare to Severus.Severus returned a thin smile. “I still am, so far as they know.”“Harry,” said Albus, eyes only for the boy. “What do you mean, thatmakes it obvious?”“Information theory 101,” the boy said in a lecturing tone. “Observingvariable X conveys information about variable Y, if and only if the possible values of X have different probabilities given different states of Y.The instant you hear about anything whatsoever that varies between aspy and a nonspy, you should immediately think of exploiting it to distinguish spies from nonspies. Similarly, to distinguish reality from lies,you need a process which behaves differently in the presence of truth andfalsehood—that’s why ‘faith’ doesn’t work as a discriminant, while ‘makeexperimental predictions and test them’ does. You say someone with theDark Mark can’t reveal its secrets to anyone who doesn’t already knowthem. So to find out how the Dark Mark operates, write down every wayyou can imagine the Dark Mark might work, then watch Professor Snapetry to tell each of those things to a confederate—maybe one who doesn’tknow what the experiment is about—I’ll explain binary search later sothat you can play Twenty Questions to narrow things down—and whatever he can’t say out loud is true. His silence would be something thatbehaves differently in the presence of true statements about the Mark,versus false statements, you see.”Minerva’s mouth was hanging open, she realized; and she closed itabruptly. Even Albus looked surprised.“And after that, like I said, any behavioral difference between spiesand nonspies can be used to identify spies. Once you’ve identified at leastone magically censored secret of the Dark Mark, you can test someone forthe Dark Mark by seeing if they can reveal that secret to somebody whodoesn’t already know it—”“Thank you, Mr. Potter.”Everyone looked at Severus. The Potions Master was straightening,his teeth bared in a grimace of angry triumph. “Headmaster, I can nowspeak freely of the Mark. If we know we are caught for a Death Eater,before others who have not yet seen our bare arms, our Mark reveals itselfwhether we will it or no. But if they have already seen our arms bare, itdoes not reveal itself; nor if we are only being tested from suspicion. Thusthe Dark Mark seems to identify Death Eaters—but only those alreadyfound, you perceive.”“Ah…” Albus said. “Thank you, Severus.” He closed his eyes briefly.“That would indeed explain why Black escaped even Peter’s notice… ah,well. And Harry’s proposed test?”The Potions Master shook his head. “The Dark Lord was no fool, despite Potter’s delusions. The moment such a test is suspected, the Markceases to bind our tongues. Yet I could not hint at the possibility, butonly wait for another to deduce it.” Another thin smile. “I would awardyou a good many House points, Mr. Potter, if it would not compromisemy cover. But as you can see, the Dark Lord was quite cunning.” Hisgaze grew more distant. “Oh,” Severus breathed, “he was very cunningindeed…”Harry Potter sat still for a long moment.Then—“No,” Harry said. The boy shook his head. “No, that can’t actually betrue. First of all, we’re talking about the kind of logic puzzle that wouldappear in chapter one of a Raymond Smullyan book, nowhere near thelevel of what Muggle scientists do for a living. And second, for all I know,it took the Dark Lord five months of thinking to invent the puzzle I justsolved in five seconds—”“Is it that inconceivable to you, Potter, that anyone could be so intelligent as yourself?” The Potions Master’s voice held more curiosity thanscorn.“It’s called a base rate, Professor Snape. The evidence is equally compatible with the Dark Lord inventing that puzzle over the course of fivemonths or over the course of five seconds, but in any given populationthere’ll be many more people who can do it in five months than in fiveseconds…” Harry pasted a hand against his forehead. “Darn it, how canI explain this? I suppose, from your perspective, the Dark Lord came upwith a clever puzzle and I cleverly solved it and that makes us look equal.”“I remember your first day of Potions class,” the Potions Master saiddryly. “I think you have a ways still to go.”“Peace, Severus,” Albus said. “Harry has already accomplished morethan you know. Yet tell me, Harry—why do you believe the Dark Lord isless than you? Surely he is a damaged soul in many ways. But cunningfor cunning—you are not yet ready to face him, I would judge; and I knowthe full tally of your deeds.”The frustrating thing about this conversation was that Harry couldn’t sayhis actual reasons for disagreeing, which violated several basic principles ofcooperative discourse.He couldn’t explain how Bellatrix had really been removed fromAzkaban—not by You-Know-Who in any guise, but by the combined witsof Harry and Professor Quirrell.Harry didn’t want to say in front of Professor McGonagall that the existence of brain damage implied that there were no such things as souls.Which made a successful immortality ritual… well, not impossible, Harrycertainly intended to forge a road to magical immortality someday, but itwould be a lot harder and require much more ingenuity than just bindingan already-existent soul to a lich’s phylactery. Which no intelligent wizard would bother doing in the first place, if they knew their souls wereimmortal.And the true and honest reason Harry knew the Dark Lord couldn’thave been that smart… well… there wasn’t any tactful way to say it, but…Harry had been to a convocation of the Wizengamot. He’d seen thelaughable ‘security precautions’, if you could call them that, guardingthe deepest levels of the Ministry of Magic. They didn’t even have theThief’s Downfall which goblins used to wash away Polyjuice and Imperius Curses on people entering Gringotts. The obvious takeover routewould be to Imperius the Minister of Magic and a few department heads,and owl a hand grenade to anyone too powerful to Imperius. Or owlthem knockout gas, if you needed them alive and in a state of LivingDeath to take hairs for Polyjuice potions. Legilimency, False Memories,the Confundus Charm—it was ridiculous, the magical world was supersaturated with ways to cheat. Harry might not do any of those thingshimself, during his own takeover of Britain, since he was constrained byEthics… well, Harry might do some of the lesser ones, since Polyjuice or atemporary Confundus or read-only Legilimency all sounded better thanan extra day of Azkaban… but…If Harry hadn’t been constrained by Ethics, it was possible he could’vewiped out the eviller sections of the Wizengamot that day; all by himself,using only a first-year’s magical power, on account of being clever enoughto figure out Dementors. Though Harry might not have been in such agreat political position after that, the surviving Wizengamot membersmight’ve found it easy and cheap to disavow his actions for P.R. purposesand condemn him, even if the smarter ones realized it was for the greatergood… but still.If you were completely unrestrained by ethics, armed with the ancientsecrets of Salazar Slytherin, had dozens of powerful followers includingLucius Malfoy, and it took you more than ten years to fail to overthrowthe government of magical Britain, it meant you were stupid.“How can I put this…” Harry said. “Look, Headmaster, you’ve gotethics, there’s a lot of battle tactics you don’t use because you’re not evil.And you fought the Dark Lord, a tremendously powerful wizard whowasn’t so restrained, and you held him off anyway. If You-Know-Whohad been super-smart on top of that, you’d be dead. All of you. You’d havedied instantly—”“Harry,” Professor McGonagall said. Her voice was faltering. “Harry,we almost did all die. More than half the Order of the Phoenix died. Ifnot for Albus—Albus Dumbledore, the greatest wizard in two centuries,Harry—we surely would have perished.”Harry passed a hand across his forehead. “I’m sorry,” Harry said. “I’mnot trying to minimize what you went through. I know that You-KnowWho was a completely evil, incredibly powerful Dark Wizard with dozensof powerful followers, and that’s… bad, yes, definitely bad. It’s just…” Allthat isn’t on remotely the same threat scale as the enemy being smart, in whichcase they Transfigure botulinum toxin and sneak a millionth of a gram into yourteacup. Was there any safe way to convey that concept without citingspecifics? Harry couldn’t think of one.“Please, Harry,” said Professor McGonagall. “Please, Harry, I begyou—take the Dark Lord seriously! He is more dangerous than—” Thesenior witch seemed to be having trouble finding words. “He is far moredangerous than Transfiguration.”Harry’s eyebrows went up before he could stop himself. A darkchuckle came from Severus Snape’s direction.Um, said the voice of Ravenclaw within him. Um, honestly ProfessorMcGonagall is right, we’re not taking this as seriously as we’d take a scientificproblem. The difficult thing is to react at all to new information, instead of justflushing it out the window. Right now it looks like we didn’t shift belief at allafter encountering an unexpected, important argument. Our dismissal of LordVoldemort as a serious threat was originally based on the Dark Mark being blatantly stupid. It would require a focused effort to de-update and suspect the wholegarden-path of reasoning we went down based on that false assumption, and we’renot putting in that effort right now.“All right,” Harry said, just as Professor McGonagall seemed to beabout to speak again. “All right, to take this seriously, I need to stop andthink for five minutes.”“Please do,” said Albus Dumbledore.Harry closed his eyes.His Ravenclaw side divided into three.Probability estimate, said Ravenclaw One, who was acting as moderator. That the Dark Lord is alive, and as smart as we are, and hence a genuinethreat.Why aren’t all his enemies already dead? said Ravenclaw Two, who wasprosecuting.Note, said Ravenclaw One, we had already thought of that argument so wecan’t use it to shift belief again each time we rehearse it.But what’s the actual flaw in the logic? said Ravenclaw Two. In worlds witha smart Lord Voldemort, everyone in the Order of the Phoenix died in the first fiveminutes of the war. The world doesn’t look like that, so we don’t live in that world.Is that really certain? asked Ravenclaw Three, who’d been appointed asthe defender. Maybe there was some reason Lord Voldemort wasn’t fighting allout back then—Like what? demanded Ravenclaw Two. Furthermore, whatever your excuse, I demand that the probability of your hypothesis be penalized in accordancewith its added complexity—Let Three talk, said Ravenclaw One.Okay… look, said Ravenclaw Three. First of all, we don’t know that anyonecan take over the Ministry just with mind control. Maybe magical Britain is reallyan oligarchy and you need enough military power to intimidate the family headsinto submission—Imperius them too, interjected Ravenclaw Two.—and the oligarchs have Thief’s Downfall in the entrances to their homes—Complexity penalty! cried Ravenclaw Two. More epicycles!—oh, be reasonable, said Ravenclaw Three. We haven’t actually seen anyone taking over the Ministry with a couple of well-placed Imperius curses. Wedon’t know that it can actually be done that easily.But, said Ravenclaw Two, even taking that into account… it really seemslike there should’ve been some other way. Ten years of failure, really? Using onlyconventional terrorist tactics? That’s just… not even trying.Maybe Lord Voldemort did have more creative ideas, replied RavenclawThree, but he didn’t want to tip his hand to other countries’ governments, didn’twant them to know how vulnerable they were and install Thief’s Downfall intheir Ministries. Not until he had Britain as a base and enough servants to subvert all the other major governments simultaneously.You’re assuming he wants to conquer the whole world, noted RavenclawTwo.Trelawney prophesized that he would be our equal, intoned RavenclawThree solemnly. Therefore, he wanted to take over the world.And if he is your equal, and you do have to fight him—For an instant, Harry’s mind tried to imagine the specter of two creative wizards fighting an all-out-war against each other.Harry had noted all the Charms and Potions in his first-year booksthat could be creatively used to kill people. He hadn’t been able to helphimself. Literally. He’d tried to stop his brain from doing it each time,but it was like looking at a fish and trying to stop your brain from noticing it was a fish. What someone could creatively do with seventh-year,or Auror-level, or ancient lost magic such as Lord Voldemort had possessed… didn’t bear thinking about. A magically-superpowered creativegenius psychopath wasn’t a ‘threat’, it was an extinction event.Then Harry shook his head, dismissing the gloomy line his reasoninghad been going down. The question was whether there was a significantprobability of facing anything so terrible as a Dark Rationalist in the firstplace.Prior odds that someone attempting an immortality ritual would actuallyhave it work…Call it one to a thousand, at a generous overestimate; it was not thecase that roughly one wizard in a thousand survived their death. Though,admittedly Harry didn’t have data on how many had attempted immortality rituals first.What if the Dark Lord is as smart as us? said Ravenclaw Three. You know,the way Trelawney prophesied him being our equal. Then he would make hisimmortality ritual work. P.S., don’t forget that ‘destroy all but a remnant of theother’ line.Requiring that level of intelligence was an additional burdensome detail; prior odds of a random population member being that intelligentwere low…But Lord Voldemort wasn’t a randomly selected wizard, he was oneparticular wizard in the population who’d come to everyone’s attention.The puzzle of the Mark implied a certain minimum level of intelligence,even if (hypothetically) the Dark Lord had taken longer to think it through.Then again, in the Muggle world, all of the extremely intelligent peopleHarry knew about from history had not become evil dictators or terrorists.The closest thing to that in the Muggle world was hedge-fund managers,and none of them had tried to take over so much as a third-world country,a point which put upper bounds on both their possible evil and possiblegoodness.There were hypotheses where the Dark Lord was smart and the Orderof the Phoenix didn’t just instantly die, but those hypotheses were morecomplicated and ought to get complexity penalties. After the complexitypenalties of the further excuses were factored in, there would be a largelikelihood ratio from the hypotheses ‘The Dark Lord is smart’ versus ‘TheDark Lord was stupid’ to the observation, ‘The Dark Lord did not instantlywin the war’. That was probably worth a 10:1 likelihood ratio in favor ofthe Dark Lord being stupid… but maybe not 100:1. You couldn’t actuallysay that ‘The Dark Lord instantly wins’ had a probability of more than 99percent, assuming the Dark Lord started out smart; the sum over all possible excuses would be more than .01.And then there was the Prophecy… which might or might not haveoriginally included a line about how Lord Voldemort would immediatelydie if he confronted the Potters. Which Albus Dumbledore had thenedited in Professor McGonagall’s memory, in order to lure Lord Voldemort to his doom. If there was no such line, the Prophecy did soundsomewhat more like You-Know-Who and the Boy-Who-Lived were destined to have some later confrontation. But in that case, it was less likelythat Dumbledore would’ve come up with a plausible-sounding excusenot to take Harry to the Hall of Prophecy…Harry was wondering if he could even get a Bayesian calculation out ofthis. Of course, the point of a subjective Bayesian calculation wasn’t that,after you made up a bunch of numbers, multiplying them out would giveyou an exactly right answer. The real point was that the process of makingup numbers would force you to tally all the relevant facts and weigh allthe relative probabilities. Like realizing, as soon as you actually thoughtabout the probability of the Dark Mark not-fading if You-Know-Who wasdead, that the probability wasn’t low enough for the observation to countas strong evidence. One version of the process was to tally hypothesesand list out evidence, make up all the numbers, do the calculation, andthen throw out the final answer and go with your brain’s gut feeling afteryou’d forced it to really weigh everything. The trouble was that the itemsof evidence weren’t conditionally independent, and there were multipleinteracting background facts of interest……well, one thing at least was certain.If the calculation could be done at all, it was going to take a piece ofpaper and a pencil.In the fireplace at one side of the Headmaster’s office, the flames suddenly flared up, turning from orange to bright billious green.“Ah!” said Professor McGonagall into the uncomfortable non-silence.“That would be Mad-Eye Moody, I suppose.”“Let this matter bide for now,” the Headmaster said in some relief, ashe too turned to regard the Floo. “I believe we are about to receive somenews regarding it, as well.”Hypothesis: Hermione Granger(April 8th, 1992, 6:53pm)Meanwhile in the Great Hall of Hogwarts, as the students who didn’thave secret meetings with the Headmaster bustled about their dinneraround four huge tables—“It’s funny,” Dean Thomas said thoughtfully. “I didn’t believe the General when he said that what we learned would change us forever, and we’dnever be able to return to a normal life afterward. Once we knew. Oncewe saw what he could see.”“I know!” said Seamus Finnigan. “I thought it was just a joke too!Like, you know, everything else General Chaos ever said ever.”“But now—” Dean said sadly. “We can’t go back, can we? It’d be like going back to a Muggle school after having been to Hogwarts. We’ve just…we’ve just got to stay around each other. That’s all we can do, or we’ll gocrazy.”Seamus Finnigan, next to him, just nodded wordlessly and ate another bite of veldbeest.Around them, the conversation at the Gryffindor table continued. Itwasn’t as relentless as it’d been yesterday, but now and then the topic wandered back.“Well, there must’ve been some sort of love triangle,” said a secondyear witch named Samantha Crowley (she never answered when askedif there was any relation). “The question is, which ways was it going before it all went wrong? Who was in love with who—and whether or notthat person loved them back—I don’t know how many possibilities thereare—”“Sixty-four,” said Sarah Varyabil, a blossoming beauty who probablyshould’ve been Sorted into Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff instead. “No, wait,that’s wrong. I mean, if nobody loved Malfoy and Malfoy didn’t love anyone then he wouldn’t really be part of the love triangle… this is going totake Arithmancy, could you all wait two minutes?”“I, for one, think it perfectly clear that Granger is Potter’s moirail, andthat Potter was auspisticing between Malfoy and Granger.” The witch1412 *who’d spoken nodded with the self-satisfaction of someone who has justprecisely nailed down a complicated issue.“Those aren’t even words,” objected a young wizard. “You’re just making them up as you go.”“Sometimes you can’t describe a thing using real words.”“It’s so sad,” said Sherice Ngaserin, who actually had tears in her eyes.“They were just—they were just so obviously meant to be together!”“You mean Potter and Malfoy?” said a second-year named ColleenJohnson. “I know—their families hated each other so much, there’s noway they couldn’t fall in love—”“No, I mean all three of them,” said Sherice.This produced a brief pause in the huddled conversation. DeanThomas was quietly choking on his lemonade, trying not to make anysounds as it trickled out of his mouth and soaked into his shirt.“Wow,” said a dark-haired witch by the name of Nancy Hua. “That’sreally… sophisticated of you, Sherice.”“Look, you all, we need to keep this realistic,” said Eloise Rosen, a tallwitch who’d been General of an army and hence spoke with an air of authority. “We know—because she kissed him—that Granger was in lovewith Potter. So the only reason she’d try to kill Malfoy is if she knew thatshe was losing Potter to him. There’s no need to make it all sound socomplicated—you’re all acting like this is a play instead of real life!”“But even if Granger was in love, it’s still funny that she’d just snaplike that,” said Chloe, whose black robes combined with her night-blackskin to make her look like a darkened silhouette. “I don’t know… I thinkmaybe there’s more to this than just a romance novel gone wrong. I thinkmaybe most people haven’t got any idea at all what’s going on.”“Yes! Thank you!” burst out Dean Thomas. “Look—don’t you realize—like Harry Potter told us all—if you didn’t predict that something wouldhappen, if it took you completely by surprise, then what you believedabout the world when you didn’t see it coming, isn’t enough to explain…”Dean’s voice trailed off, as he saw that nobody was listening. “It’s completely hopeless, isn’t it?”“You hadn’t figured that out yet?” said Lavender Brown, who was sitting across the table from her two fellow former Chaotics. “How’d you1413 *ever make Lieutenant?”“Oh, you two be quiet!” Sherice snapped at them. “It’s obvious youboth want the three of them for yourselves!”“I mean it!” Chloe said. “What if what’s really going on is differentfrom all the, you know, normal things that all the ordinary people are talking about? What if somebody—made Granger do what she did, just likePotter was trying to tell everyone?”“I think Chloe’s right,” said a foreign-looking boy wizard who alwaysintroduced himself as ‘Adrian Turnipseed’, though his parents had actually named him Mad Drongo. “I think this whole time there’s been…”Adrian lowered his voice ominously, “…a hidden hand…” Adrian raised hisvoice again, “shaping all that’s happened. One person who’s been behindeverything, from the beginning. And I don’t mean Professor Snape, either.”“You don’t mean—” gasped Sarah.“Yes,” Adrian said. “The real one behind it all is—Tracey Davis!”“That’s what I think too,” Chloe said. “After all—” She glanced aroundrapidly. “Ever since that thing with the bullies and the ceiling—even thetrees in the forests around Hogwarts look like they’re shaking, like they’reafraid—”Seamus Finnigan was frowning thoughtfully. “I think I see whereHarry gets his… you know… from,” Seamus said, lowering his voice so thatonly Lavender and Dean could hear.“Oh, I totally know what you mean,” Lavender said. She didn’t botherto lower her own voice. “It’s a wonder he didn’t crack and just start killingeveryone ages ago.”“Personally,” Dean said, also in a quieter voice, “I’d say the really scarypart is—that could’ve been us.”“Yeah,” said Lavender. “It’s a good thing we’re all perfectly sane now.”Dean and Seamus nodded solemnly.1414 *Hypothesis: G. L.(April 8th, 1992, 8:08pm)The Floo-Fire of the Headmaster’s office blazed a bright pale-green,the fire concentrating in on itself into a spinning emeraldine whirlwind,and then flared even brighter and spit a human figure into the air—There was a blur of motion as the resolving figure snapped up a wand,smoothly spinning with the Floo’s momentum like a ballet dance step, sothat his firing arc covered the entire 360-degree arc of the room; and thenjust as abruptly, the figure stopped in place.In the first instant that Harry saw that man, before Harry even tookin the eye, he noticed the scars on the hands, the scars on the face, likethe man had been burned and cut over his entire body; though only theman’s hands and face were visible, of all his flesh. The rest of the man’sbody was hidden, encased not in robes, but in leather that looked morelike armor than clothing; dark gray leather, matching the man’s mess ofgrayed hair.The next thing that Harry’s vision comprehended was the brilliantblue eye occupying the right side of the man’s face.One part of Harry’s mind realized that the person whom ProfessorMcGonagall had named ‘Mad-Eye Moody’ was the same as the one Dumbledore had called ‘Alastor’, within the memory Dumbledore had shownHarry; an image from before whatever event had scarred every inch ofthe man’s body and taken a chunk out of his nose—And another part of his mind noticed the jolt of adrenaline. Harry haddrawn his wand in sheer reflex when the man had spun out of the Floo likethat, there’d been something about it that felt like ambush, Harry’s handhad already started to level his wand for a Somnium before he’d managedto stop himself. Even now the armored man was holding his wand level,not pointed at any particular person but covering the whole room, andthat wand was already in perfect line with his eyes, like a soldier sightingdown a gun. There was danger in the man’s stance and the set of his boots,danger in the leather armor he wore and danger in that brilliant blue eye.When the scarred man spoke, addressing the Headmaster, his voicewas edged. “I suppose you think this room is secure?”1415 *“There are only friends here,” Dumbledore said.The man’s head jerked toward Harry. “That include him?”“If Harry Potter is not our friend,” Dumbledore said gravely, “then weare all certainly doomed; so we may as well assume that he is.”The man’s wand stayed level, not quite pointing at Harry. “Boy almostdrew on me just then.”“Er…” Harry said. He noticed that his hand was still tightly holdingthe wand, and consciously relaxed his hand and dropped it back to hisside. “Sorry about that, you looked a bit… combat-ready.”The scarred man’s wand moved slightly away from where it had almost pointed at Harry, though it didn’t lower, and the man let out a shortbark of laughter. “Constant vigilance, eh, lad?” said the man.“It’s not paranoia if they really are out to get you,” Harry recited theproverb.The man turned fully toward Harry; and insofar as Harry could readany expression on the scarred face, the man now looked interested.Dumbledore’s eyes had regained some of the brilliant twinkle thatthey’d had before the Azkaban breakout, a smile beneath his silver mustache as though that smile had never left. “Harry, this is Alastor Moody,called also Mad-Eye, who will command the Order of the Phoenix afterme—if anything should happen to me, that is. Alastor, this is Harry Potter. I have every hope the two of you shall get along fantastically.”“I’ve heard a good deal about you, boy,” said Mad-Eye Moody. His onedark natural eye stayed fixed on Harry, while the point of brilliant bluespun frantically, seeming to rotate all the way around within its socket.“Not all of it good. Heard they’re calling you the Dementor Spooker, inthe Department.”After some consideration, Harry decided to reply with a knowingsmile.“How’d you pull off that one, boy?” the man said softly. Now his blueeye was fixed on Harry as well. “I had a little chat with one of the Aurors who escorted the Dementor there from Azkaban. Beth Martin saidit came straight from the pit, and no-one gave it any special instructionsalong the way. Of course, she could be lying.”1416 *“There wasn’t any sneaky trick to that one,” Harry said. “I just did itthe hard way. Of course, I could also be lying.”Dumbledore was leaning back in his chair, chuckling in the background, like he was just another device in the Headmaster’s Office andthat was the sound he made.The scarred man turned back to face the Headmaster, though hiswand stayed pointed low and in Harry’s general direction. When hespoke his voice was gruff and businesslike. “I have a lead on a recent hostof Voldie’s. You’re certain his shade is in Hogwarts now?”“Not certain—” Dumbledore began.“Say what?” Harry interrupted. After having nearly concluded thatthe Dark Lord didn’t exist, it was a shock to hear it being discussed thatmatter-of-factly.“Voldie’s host,” Moody said shortly. “The one he possessed before hetook over Granger.”“If the tales speak true,” Dumbledore said, “there is some device ofpower which binds Voldemort’s shade to this world; and by that meanshe may bargain with a host for possession of their body, conferring onthem some portion of his power and his pride—”“So the obvious question is who’s gained too much power too quickly,”Moody said abruptly. “And it turns out that there’s a fellow who’s goneand banished the Bandon Banshee, staked an entire rogue vampire clanin Asia, tracked down the Wagga-Wagga Werewolf, and exterminated apack of ghouls using a tea-strainer. And he’s milking it for all it’s worth;there’s been talk of the Order of Merlin. Seems to have turned into acharmer and a politician, not just a powerful wizard.”“Dear me,” murmured Dumbledore. “Are you certain that he is notrelying on his own skills?”“Checked his grades,” Moody said. “Record shows Gilderoy Lockhartreceived a Troll in his Defense O.W.L.S., didn’t bother with the N.E.W.T.Just the sort of sucker to take the deal Voldie was offering.” The blue eyewhirled crazily within its socket. “Unless you remember Lockhart as astudent, and think he had enough potential to do all that by himself?”“No,” said Professor McGonagall. She frowned. “Not a chance, Ishould say.”1417 *“I fear I must agree,” Dumbledore said with an undertone of pain. “Ah,Gilderoy, you poor fool…”Moody’s grin was more like a snarl. “Three in the morning work foryou, Albus? Lockhart should be at his home tonight.”Harry listened to this with increasing alarm, wondering if even theMinistry had any rules about magistrates needing to issue warrants—never mind the illegal vigilante organization Harry now seemed to havejoined. “Excuse me,” Harry said. “What exactly happens at three in themorning?”There must have been something in Harry’s voice that gave him away,because the scarred man whirled on him. “You have a problem with that,boy?”Harry paused, trying to figure out how to phrase this to the stranger—“You want to take him down yourself?” pressed the scarred man. “Getrevenge for your parents, eh?”“No,” Harry said as politely he could. “Honestly—look, if we knew forcertain he was a willing host for You-Know-Who, that’s one thing, but ifwe’re not sure and you’re heading off to kill him—”“Kill?” Mad-Eye Moody snorted. “It’s what’s locked up in his head,”Moody tapped his forehead, “that we need from him, boy. If we’re lucky,Voldie can’t wipe the sucker’s memories as easy as in his living days, andLockhart will remember what the horcrux looked like.”Harry mentally noted down the word horcrux for future research, andsaid, “I’m just worried that someone innocent—what sounds like a prettydecent person, if he did do all that himself—might be about to get hurt.”“Aurors hurt people,” the scarred man said shortly. “Bad people, ifyou’re lucky. Some days you won’t be lucky, and that’s all there is to it.Just remember, Dark Wizards hurt a lot more people than we do.”Harry took a deep breath. “Can you at least try not to hurt this person,in case he’s not—”“What is a first-year doing in this room, Albus?” demanded thescarred man, now whirling to face the Headmaster. “And don’t tell meit’s for what he did when he was a baby.”“Harry Potter is not an ordinary first-year,” the Headmaster said quietly. “He has already accomplished feats impossible enough to shock even1418 *me, Alastor. His is the only intellect in the Order which might somedaymatch that of Voldemort himself, as you or I never could.”The scarred man leaned over the Headmaster’s desk. “He’s a liability.Naive. Doesn’t know a bloody thing about what war’s like. I want himout of here and all his memories of the Order wiped before one of Voldie’sservants plucks them straight out of his mind—”“I’m an Occlumens, actually.”Mad-Eye Moody directed a narrow look at the Headmaster, who nodded.And then the scarred man turned to face Harry, their gazes meeting.The sudden fury of the Legilimency attack almost made Harry fall offhis chair, as a blade of white-hot steel cut into the imaginary person atthe forefront of his mind. Harry hadn’t had a chance to practice sinceMr. Bester’s training, and Harry very nearly lost his grip on the imaginary person the back-of-his-mind was pretending to be, as that person’sworld turned into searing lava and a furious probe of questions. Harryalmost lost his grip on only pretending to hallucinate, only pretending to bethe imaginary person that was screaming in shock and pain as the Legilimency tore apart his sanity and reshaped him to believe that he was onfire—Harry managed to break eye contact, dropping his eyes to Moody’schin.“You’re out of practice, boy,” Moody said. Harry wasn’t looking atthe man’s face, but his voice was deadly grim. “And I’ll warn you of thisbut once. Voldie isn’t like any other Legilimens in recorded history. Hedoesn’t need to look you in the eyes, and if your shields are that rusty he’dcreep in so softly you’d never notice a thing.”“Duly noted,” Harry said to the scarred chin. Harry was more shakenthan he’d have admitted; Mr. Bester hadn’t been anywhere near that powerful, and had never tested Harry like that. Pretending to be someonehurting that much had… Harry couldn’t find words for describing whatit felt like to contain an imaginary person in that much pain, but it hadn’tbeen normal. “Do I get any credit for being an Occlumens in the firstplace?”“So you’re think you’re all grown up already, eh? Look me in the eyes!”1419 *Harry strengthened his shields, and looked once more into the darkgrey eye and the brilliant blue.“Ever watched someone die?” asked Mad-Eye Moody.“My parents,” Harry said evenly. “I recovered the memory in Januarywhen I went in front of a Dementor to learn the Patronus Charm. Iremember You-Know-Who’s voice—” A chill went through Harry’s body,his wand twitching in his hand. “My main tactical report is that YouKnow-Who could speak the Killing Curse in less than half a second, butyou probably already knew that.”There was a gasp from Professor McGonagall’s direction, andSeverus’s face had tightened.“All right,” Mad-Eye Moody said softly. A strange, thin grin twistedup the lips within the scarred face. “I’ll make you the same offer I’d maketo any trainee Auror. Land one touch on me, boy—one hit, one spell—and I’ll concede your right to talk back to me.”“Alastor!” exclaimed Professor McGonagall’s voice. “Surely that’s anunreasonable test! Mr. Potter, whatever his other merits, does not havea hundred years of fighting experience!”Harry’s eyes made a lightning dart around the room, passing over thepeculiar devices, glancing past Dumbledore and Severus and the SortingHat, settling briefly here and there. Harry couldn’t see Professor McGonagall from where he was, but that didn’t matter. There was only onedevice he’d really wanted to look at, and the point of all the other glanceshad just been to conceal which one.“All righty,” Harry said, and hopped off his chair, ignoring Professor McGonagall’s inhalation and the Potions Master’s snort of disbelief.Dumbledore’s eyebrows had lifted, and Moody was grinning like a tiger.“Be sure to wake me up in forty minutes if he does get me.” Harry settledinto a duelist’s starting stance, his wand held low. “Let’s go, then—”Harry opened his eyes, his head feeling like it had been stuffed with cotton wool.Everyone else was gone from the Headmaster’s office, the Floo-Firedimmed; only Dumbledore still waited behind the desk.“Hello, Harry,” the Headmaster said quietly.“I didn’t even see him move,” Harry marvelled, muscles creaking as hesat up.“You were standing two paces away from Alastor Moody,” said Dumbledore, “and you took your eye off his wand.”Harry nodded, as he took the Cloak of Invisibility out of his pouch. “Imean—I was taking the dueling stance so that he’d think I was a standardidiot and underestimate me—but I have to admit, that was impressive.”“So you planned it all along, Harry?” Dumbledore said.“Of course,” Harry said. “Note how I’m doing this as soon as I wakeup, rather than pausing to think of it.”Harry drew the hood of the Cloak over his head, and glanced back upat the wall clock he’d surreptitiously glanced at earlier.It had then shown around twenty-three minutes after eight, and nowit was five minutes after nine.Minerva stared as the boy put himself into the dueling stance, his wandheld low. For a second Minerva wondered if Harry might possibly—no,that was completely ridiculous, it was Mad-Eye Moody and that was beyond impossible. Of course that was what she’d thought about his partialTransfiguration, too…“Let’s go, then,” Harry said and fell over.Severus gave a single chuckle. “Mr. Potter has his points, I must confess,” the Potions Master said. “Though I would never say it while he wasawake, and if you repeat the words I shall deny them, for the boy’s egois quite large enough already. Mr. Potter does have his points, Mad-Eye,but duelling is not among them.”Mad-Eye’s own chuckle was lower and grimmer. “Oh, yes,” said MadEye. “Only fools duel. Standing like that and waiting for me to attack,1421 *what was the boy thinking? Why, I ought to give him a scar, to rememberthis occasion—”“Alastor!” barked Albus, just as she cried “Stop!”, Severus dashed forward, and Mad-Eye Moody deliberately leveled his wand on Harry Potter’s body.“Stupefy!”Mad-Eye’s body seemed to almost flicker as he spun on his woodenfoot like lightning, faster than she’d ever seen anyone move withoutmagic, the red Stunning Hex passing through the suddenly empty airand barely missing Severus to crash into the opposite wall, and by thetime her eyes jerked back to Moody there were seventeen radiant orbsin the pattern of a Sagitta Magica, visible for only an instant before theystreaked brilliance and struck something that fell to the floor with a thud—“Hello again, Harry,” said Dumbledore.“I cannot believe that guy’s reaction time,” Harry said, brushing offhis Cloak as he stood up from where he’d been lying invisible on the floor,unseen by his previous self. “I can’t believe his movement speed either.I’m going to have to figure out some way to zap him without speaking anincantation that gives it away…”—and then Mad-Eye ducked hard and fast, his hands hitting flat on thefloor. She almost didn’t see the two tiny white threads passing throughthe space he’d been, but her eyes went to the blue spark when the threadsimpacted on one of the Headmaster’s devices, and by the time she managed to turn her eyes back, Mad-Eye had spun smoothly up to his feet,his wand was dancing unseeably fast and there was another thuddingsound—“Hello again, Harry.”“Pardon me, Headmaster, but could you let me go down your stairs,and then come back up again, before I make the final jump backward?This is going to take longer than one hour of preparation—”Minerva gaped at Mad-Eye Moody, who hadn’t lowered his wand in theslightest; and Severus had a look on his face that was almost like shock.“Well, boy?” said Mad-Eye Moody. “What else have you got?”Harry Potter’s head appeared, floating in midair as an invisible handdrew back the hood of his invisibility cloak.“That eye,” said Harry Potter. There was a strange fierce light in theboy’s eyes. “That isn’t any ordinary device. It can see right through myinvisibility cloak. You dodged my Transfigured taser as soon as I startedraising it, even though I didn’t speak any incantations. And now that I’vewatched it again—you spotted all my Time-Turned selves the momentyou Flooed into this room, didn’t you?”Mad-Eye Moody was smiling, the same teeth-bared grin she’d seenhim wear as they’d faced off against Voldemort himself. “Spend a hundred years hunting Dark wizards, and you see everything,” said Moody.“I once arrested a young Japanese who tried a similar trick. He found outthe hard way that his shadow replica technique was no match for this eyeof mine.”“You see in all directions,” Harry Potter said, that strange fierce lightstill in his gaze. “No matter where that eye is pointing, it sees everythingaround you.”Moody’s tiger-grin grew wider. “There’s no more of you in this room,now,” Mad-Eye said. “Think that’s because you’ll give up after this time,or because you’ll win? Any bets, boy?”“It’s my final attempt because I decided to stake my last three hourson one shot,” said Harry Potter. “As for whether I win—”There was a blur filling the whole air of the Headmaster’s office. MadEye Moody leapt to one side with blinding speed and an instant laterHarry’s head darted backward as he cried “Stuporfy!”Three shimmers in the air went past Harry’s moving head, just as ared bolt erupted from Harry’s location, shooting past Moody as he dodgedin yet another direction—If she’d blinked, she would have missed it, the red bolt making an angled turn in midair and slamming into Moody’s ear.Moody fell.Harry Potter’s floating head dropped to the height of a first-year ontheir hands and knees, then dropped further to the ground, his face showing sudden exhaustion.Minerva McGonagall said, “What in Merlin’s name just—”“So you went to Flitwick, then,” Moody said. The retired Auror was nowsitting in a chair, drinking long draughts from a restorative in a bottlehe’d taken off his belt.Harry Potter nodded, now sitting in his own chair instead of perchedon an armrest. “I tried the Defense Professor first, but—” The boy grimaced. “He… wasn’t available. Well, I’d decided it was worth risking fiveHouse points, and if you say a risk is worth it, you can’t complain whenyou have to pay up. Anyway, I figured that if you had an eye that sawthings other people couldn’t see, then as Isaac Asimov pointed out in Second Foundation, the weapon to use is a brilliant light. Read enough sciencefiction, you know, and you’ll read everything at least once. Anyway, I toldProfessor Flitwick that I needed a Charm that would make a huge number of shapes, bright and flickering and filling the whole office, but invisible, so only your eye could see them. I had no idea what it would evenmean to cast an illusion and then make it invisible, but I figured if I didn’tmention that out loud, Professor Flitwick would just do it anyway, and hedid. Turns out there was no spell like that I could cast myself, but FlitwickCharmed me a one-time device for it—though I had to persuade him thatit wasn’t cheating, since nothing could possibly be cheating against an Auror who’d lived long enough to retire. And then I still didn’t see how Icould hit you, when you were moving that fast. So I asked about targetedspells, and that was when Flitwick showed me that hex I cast at the end,the Swerving Stunner. It’s one of Professor Flitwick’s own inventions—he’s a champion duellist as well as a Charms Master—”“I know that, son.”“Sorry. Anyway, the Professor says he left the duelling circuit beforehe got a chance to use that spell, since it only works as a finishing moveon an unshielded opponent. The hex gets as close to the target as possiblealong its original trajectory, and then once it detects that the target isgetting more distant again, the hex turns in midair and heads straight forthe target. It can only swerve once—but the incantation sounds very closeto ‘Stupefy’ and the hex is the same red color, so if the enemy thinks it’s aregular Stunning Hex and tries a normal dodge, that midair retargetingwill finish them off. Oh, and the Professor requested that none of us talkabout his special move, just in case he does get a chance to use it duringcompetition someday.”“But—” said Professor McGonagall. She glanced at Mad-Eye Moody,who was nodding his approval, and at Severus, who was keeping hisface decidedly blank. “Mr. Potter, you just stunned Mad-Eye Moody! Themost famous Dark wizard hunter in the history of the Auror Office! Thatshould’ve been impossible!”Moody let out a dark chuckle. “What’s your answer to that one, kid?I’m curious.”“Well…” Harry said. “First of all, Professor McGonagall, neither of uswere fighting seriously.”“Neither of you?”“Of course,” Harry said. “In a serious fight, Mr. Moody would’vedropped all my copies immediately without waiting for them to attack.And on my side, if it was actually necessary to take down the most famousAuror in the history of the office, I’d get Headmaster Dumbledore to doit for me. And beyond that… since that wasn’t a real fight…” Harry paused.“How can I put this? Wizards are used to duels where people fight backand forth with spells for a while. But if two Muggles with guns stand in asmall room and fire bullets at each other… then whoever hits first, wins.And if one of them is deliberately missing his shots, giving the otherperson one chance after another—like Mr. Moody gave me one chanceafter another—well, you’d have to be pretty pathetic to lose.”“Oh, not that pathetic,” Moody said with a slightly threatening grin.Harry didn’t seem to notice. “You might say that Mr. Moody was testing me to see if I would try to fight him, or try to win. That is, whetherI’d carry out the role of somebody fighting—use standard spells I alreadyknew, even though I didn’t expect the consequences of that action to bevictory—or if I’d search through unusual plans until I found somethingthat could win. Like the difference between a student who sits in class because that’s what students do, versus a student who cares enough to askthemselves what it takes to actually learn a piece of material, and practiceshowever necessary—you see, Professor McGonagall? When you look atit that way—realize that Mr. Moody was giving me chances, and that Ishouldn’t attack in the first place unless I think I can win—then I don’tcome out looking so well, since it actually took me three tries to get him.Plus, like I said, in a real fight Mr. Moody could’ve turned himself invisible,or put up shields—”“Don’t go relying too much on shields, boy,” Mad-Eye said. Theleather-clad Auror took another sip from his restorative flask. “Whatyou learn in your first year at the academy doesn’t stay true forever, notagainst the strongest Dark Wizards. Every shield ever made, there’ssome curse that goes straight through it, if you’re not quick enough tocast the counter. And there’s one curse that goes through everything,and it’s a curse any Death Eater will use.”Harry Potter nodded gravely. “Right, some spells are impossible toblock. I’ll remember that, in case anyone casts the Killing Curse at me.Again.”“That kind of cleverness gets people killed, boy, and don’t you forgetit.”A sad-sounding sigh from the Boy-Who-Lived. “I know. Sorry.”“So, son. You had something to say about when Albus and I go afterLockhart?”Harry opened his mouth, then paused. “I won’t tell you how to runa war,” the Boy-Who-Lived said eventually. “I don’t have any experienceat that. All I know is that there are consequences. Please be advised thatmy own assessment is that Lockhart is probably innocent, so if you canavoid hurting him without too much risk—” The boy shrugged. “I don’tknow the cost. Just please, if you can, be careful not to hurt him if he’sinnocent.”“If I can,” said Moody.“And—you’re aiming to look through his mind for evidence about theDark Lord, aren’t you? I don’t know what the rules are in magical Britainabout admissible evidence—but everyone’s always guilty of breakingsome law or another, there’s just too many laws. So if it’s not about theDark Lord, don’t turn him in to the Ministry, just Obliviate him and go,okay?”Moody frowned. “Son, nobody gains power that fast without beingup to something.”“Then leave it for the ordinary Aurors, if and when they find evidencethe ordinary way. Please, Mr. Moody. Call it a quirk of my Muggle upbringing, but if it’s not about the war I don’t want us to be the evil police who break into people’s houses in the middle of the night, rummagethrough their minds and send them off to Azkaban.”“I don’t see the sense of it, son, but I suppose I could do you the favor.”“Is there aught else, Alastor?” inquired Albus.“Yes,” said Moody. “About that Defense Professor of yours—”Hypothesis: Gilderoy Lockhart: ENDHypothesis: Dumbledore(April 9th, 1992, 5:32pm)As Professor Quirrell slowly raised up his tea, the teacup jerked inmidair, sending the dark translucent liquid just barely slopping over theside, so that only three single drops crawled down the side of the teacup.Harry would have missed it, if he hadn’t happened to be watching closely;for Professor Quirrell’s hand was perfectly steady on the cup before andafter.If that small jerky motion advanced to a constant tremor, it wouldbe the end of any non-wandless magic for the Defense Professor. Wandwork had no room for trembling fingers. How much that would actuallyhandicap Professor Quirrell, if at all, Harry couldn’t guess. The DefenseProfessor was certainly capable of wandless magic, yet still tended to usea wand for larger things—but for him that might only be a convenience…“Insanity,” said Professor Quirrell, as he carefully sipped from histea—he was looking at the teacup, not at Harry, which was unusual forhim—“can be a signature all its own.”The Defense Professor’s small office was silent, the sound-wardedroom quiet in a way the Headmaster’s office never could be. Sometimesthe two of them both happened to finish exhaling or inhaling at the sametime; and then there was an auditory emptiness that was almost a soundin itself.“I’ll agree with that in one sense,” Harry said. “If somebody tells methat everyone is staring at them and that their underwear is being dustedwith thought-controlling powder, I know they’re psychotic, becausethat’s the standard signature of psychosis. But if you tell me that anything confusing points to Albus Dumbledore as a suspect, that seems…overreaching. Just because I can’t see a purpose doesn’t mean there is nopurpose.”“Purposeless?” said Professor Quirrell. “Oh, but the madness of Dumbledore is not that he is purposeless, but that he has too many purposes.The Headmaster might have planned this to make Lucius Malfoy throwaway his game for vengeance on you—or it might be a dozen other plots.Who knows what the Headmaster thinks he has reason to do, when hehas found reason to do so many strange things already?”Harry had politely declined tea, even knowing that Professor Quirrell would know what it meant. He’d considered bringing his own canof soda—but had decided against that as well, after realizing how easy itwould be for the Defense Professor to teleport in a bit of potion, even ifthe two of them couldn’t touch each other with direct magic.“I have seen a little now of Dumbledore,” Harry said. “Unless everything I have seen is a lie, I find it difficult to believe that he would plot tosend any Hogwarts student to Azkaban. Ever.”“Ah,” the Defense Professor said softly, the tiny reflection of theteacup gleaming in his pale eyes. “But perhaps that is another signature,Mr. Potter. You have not yet comprehended the perspective of a manlike Dumbledore. If he must, in some sufficiently noble cause, sacrificea student—why, who would he choose, but she who declared herself aheroine?”That gave Harry some pause. It might just be hindsight bias, but thatdid seem to concentrate some of that hypotheses’s probability mass ontoframing Hermione in particular. Similarly, Professor Quirrell had predicted in advance that Dumbledore might target Draco…But if it’s you behind all of this, Professor, you might have shaped your plansto frame the Headmaster, and taken care to cast suspicion on him in advance.The concept of ‘evidence’ had something of a different meaning,when you were dealing with someone who had declared themselves toplay the game at ‘one level higher than you’.“I see your point, Professor,” Harry said evenly, giving no hint of hisother thoughts. “So you think it most probable that it was the Headmaster who framed Hermione?”“Not necessarily, Mr. Potter.” Professor Quirrell drained his teacupin one swallow and then set it down, the cup making a sharp rap as itdescended. “There is also Severus Snape—though what he might thinkto gain from this, I could not guess. Thus he is not my prime suspecteither.”“Then who is?” Harry said, somewhat puzzled. Professor Quirrellsurely wasn’t about to reply ‘You-Know-Who’—“The Aurors have a rule,” said Professor Quirrell. “Investigate the victim. Many would-be criminals imagine that if they are the apparent victims of a crime, they shall not be suspected. So many criminals imagineit, indeed, that every senior Auror has seen it a dozen times over.”“You’re not seriously trying to convince me that Hermione—”The Defense Professor was giving Harry one of those slit-eyed looksthat meant he was being stupid.Draco? Draco had been interrogated under Veritaserum—but Luciusmight have had enough control to subvert Aurors to… oh.“You think Lucius Malfoy set up his own son?” Harry said.“Why not?” Professor Quirrell said softly. “From Mr. Malfoy’srecorded testimony, Mr. Potter, I gather that you enjoyed some success in changing Mr. Malfoy’s political views. If Lucius Malfoy learnedof that earlier… he might have decided that his former heir had become aliability.”“I don’t buy it,” Harry said flatly.“You are being wantonly naive, Mr. Potter. The history books are fullof family disputes turned murderous, for inconveniences and threats farless than those which Mr. Malfoy posed to his father. I suppose next youwill tell me that Lord Malfoy of the Death Eaters is far too gentle to wishhis son such harm.” A tinge of heavy sarcasm.“Well, yes, frankly,” Harry said. “Love is real, Professor, a phenomenon with observable effects. Brains are real, emotions are real, andlove is as much a part of the real world as apples and trees. If you made experimental predictions without taking parental love into account, you’dhave a heck of a time explaining why my own parents didn’t abandon meat an orphanage after the Incident with the Science Project.”The Defense Professor did not react to this at all.Harry continued. “From what Draco says, Lucius prioritized him overimportant Wizengamot votes. That’s significant evidence, since there’sless expensive ways to fake love, if you just want to fake it. And it’s notlike the prior probability of a parent loving their child is low. I suppose it’spossible that Lucius was just taking on the role of a loving father, and herenounced that role after he learned Draco was consorting with Muggle* 1430 *borns. But as the saying goes, Professor, one must distinguish possibilityfrom probability.”“All the better the crime,” the Defense Professor said, still in that softtone, “if no one would believe it of him.”“And how would Lucius even Memory-Charm Hermione in the firstplace, without setting off the wards? He’s not a Professor—oh, right, youthink it’s Professor Snape.”“Wrong,” said the Defense Professor. “Lucius Malfoy would trust noservant with that mission. But suppose some Hogwarts Professor, intelligent enough to cast a well-formed Memory Charm but of no great fighting ability, is visiting Hogsmeade. From a dark alley the black-clad formof Malfoy steps forth—he would go in person, for this—and speaks to hera single word.”“Imperio.”“Legilimens, rather,” said Professor Quirrell. “I do not know if the Hogwarts wards would trigger for a returning Professor under the ImperiusCurse. And if I do not know, Malfoy probably does not know either. ButMalfoy is a perfect Occlumens at least; he might be able to use Legilimency. And for the target…perhaps Aurora Sinistra; none would question the Astronomy Professor moving about at night.”“Or even more obviously, Professor Sprout,” said Harry. “Since she’sthe last person anyone would suspect.”The Defense Professor hesitated minutely. “Perhaps.”“Actually,” Harry said then, putting a thoughtful frown on his face, “Idon’t suppose you know offhand if any of the current Professors at Hogwarts were around back when Mr. Hagrid got framed in 1943?”“Dumbledore taught Transfiguration, Kettleburn taught MagicalCreatures, and Vector taught Arithmancy,” Professor Quirrell said atonce. “And I believe that Bathsheda Babbling, now of Ancient Runes,was then a Ravenclaw prefect. But Mr. Potter, there is no reason to suppose that anyone besides You-Know-Who was involved in that affair.”Harry shrugged artfully. “Seemed worth asking the question, just tocheck. Anyway, Professor, I agree it’s possible that some outsider Legilimized a member of Hogwarts staff—and then Obliviated them afterward,there’s no way anyone would forget that part. But I don’t think Lucius1431 *Malfoy is a probable candidate for the mastermind. It’s possible but notprobable that all of Lucius’s apparent love for Draco was just a sense ofduty, and that it all went up in a puff of smoke. It’s possible though notprobable that everything Lucius did in front of the Wizengamot was justan act. People’s outsides do not always resemble their insides, like yousaid. But there’s one piece of evidence that doesn’t fit at all.”“And that would be?” said the Defense Professor, his eyes half-lidded.“Lucius tried to reject a hundred thousand Galleons for Hermione’slife. I saw how surprised the Wizengamot was, when Lucius said he wasrefusing it despite the rules of honor. The Wizengamot didn’t expect thatof him. Why wouldn’t he just take the money while acting all indignantand pretending to grit his teeth? He wouldn’t actually care that muchabout throwing Hermione into Azkaban.”There was a pause. “Perhaps the role he was playing ran away withhim,” said Professor Quirrell. “It does happen, Mr. Potter, in the heat ofthe moment.”“Perhaps,” Harry said. “But it’s still one more improbability to bepostulated—and by the time you have to add up that many excuses ina theory, it can’t be at the top of the list anymore. Anything else in particular you think I ought to think about, within the range of all otherpossibilities?”There was a long silence. The Defense Professor’s eyes dropped downto look at the empty teacup before them, seeming unusually distant.“I suppose I can think of one final suspect,” the Defense Professor saidat last.Harry nodded.The Defense Professor didn’t seem to notice, but only spoke on. “Hasthe Headmaster has told you anything—even a hint—about ProfessorTrelawney’s prophecy?”“Huh?” Harry said automatically, converting his own sudden shockinto the best dissembling he could manage. It probably was at the wronglevel to fool Professor Quirrell but Harry certainly couldn’t take time tothink before replying—wait, but how on Earth would Professor Quirrell knowabout that— “Professor Trelawney made a prophecy?”“You were there to hear its beginning,” Professor Quirrell said, frowning. “You called out to the entire school that the prophecy could not beabout you, since you were not coming here, you were already here.”He is coming. The one who will tear apart the very—And that was as far as Professor Trelawney had gotten before Dumbledore had grabbed her and vanished.“Oh, that prophecy,” Harry said. “Sorry! It went clear out of my mind.”Harry thought he’d put too much force into the end statement, andwas 80%-expecting Professor Quirrell to say, Aha, now Mr. Potter, what isthis mysterious other prophecy you went to such lengths to deny—“That is foolish,” the Defense Professor said sharply, “if indeed youare telling me the truth. Prophecies are not trivial things. I have rackedmy brain much over the little that I heard, but such a small fragment issimply too little.”“You think the one who’s coming is the one who might’ve framed Hermione?” said Harry. As his mind allocated yet another hypothesis, uncertain predicate referent, he-who-is-coming.“With no offense meant to Miss Granger,” the Defense Professorsaid with another frown, “her life or death does not seem that important.But someone was to come—one who, in your interpretation, was notalready there—and someone so significant, and unknown as a player…who knows what else they may have done?”Harry nodded, and mentally sighed because he was going to have toredo his Lord-Voldemort odds calculation with yet another piece of evidence in the mix.Professor Quirrell spoke with eyes half-lidded, looking out likethrough slits. “More than the question of whom the prophecy spoke—who was meant to hear it? It is said that fates are spoken to those withthe power to cause them or avert them. Dumbledore. Myself. You. Asa distant fourth, Severus Snape. But of those four, Dumbledore andSnape would often be in Trelawney’s presence. You and I are the oneswho would not have spent much time around her before that Sunday. Ithink it quite likely that the prophecy was meant for one of us—beforeDumbledore took the prophetess away. Did the Headmaster say nothingmore to you?” Professor Quirrell’s voice was demanding now. “I thoughtI heard too much force in that denial, Mr. Potter.”“Honestly, no,” Harry said. “It had honestly slipped clear out of mymind.”“Then I am rather put out with him,” Professor Quirrell said softly. “Infact, I think that I am angry.”Harry said nothing. He didn’t even sweat. It might’ve been a poorreason for confidence, but on this particular score, Harry did happen tobe innocent.Professor Quirrell nodded once, sharply, as though in acknowledgment. “If there is nothing more to say between us, Mr. Potter, you maygo.”“I can think of one other suspect,” Harry said. “Someone you didn’tput on your list at all. Would you analyze him to me, Professor?”There was another of those moments of silence that was almost asound in itself.“As for that suspect,” the Defense Professor said softly, “I think youshall prosecute him on your own, Mr. Potter, without help from me. Ihave heard such requests before, and experience leads me to refuse. Either I will do too good a job of prosecuting myself, and convince you thatI am guilty—or else you will decide that my prosecution was too halfhearted, and that I am guilty. I will remark only this in my defense—thatI would have needed a very good reason indeed to jeopardize your fragilealliance with the heir to House Malfoy.”Hypothesis: The Defense Professor(April 8th, 1992, 8:37pm)“…so I fear I must take my leave,” Dumbledore was saying gravely. “Ipromised Quirinus… that is to say, I promised the Defense Professor…that I would not make any attempt to uncover his true identity, in myown person or any other.”“And why’d you make a fool promise like that, then?” snapped MadEye Moody.“It was an unalterable condition of his employment, or so he said.”Dumbledore glanced at Professor McGonagall, a wry smile briefly flittingover his face. “And Minerva made it clear to me that Hogwarts required acompetent Defense Professor this year, even if I had to haul Grindelwaldout of Nurmengard and prevail on old affections to persuade him to takethe position.”“I did not quite phrase it in that fashion—”“Your expression said it for you, my dear.”And so soon the four of them—Harry, Professor McGonagall, the Potions Master, and Alastor Moody aka ‘Mad-Eye’—were ensconced all bythemselves in the Headmaster’s office.It was strange how the Headmaster’s office seemed… unbalanced…without the Headmaster in it. If you didn’t have the ancient wizenedmaster to make it all seem solemn, you were just four people trying to havea serious meeting while surrounded by bizarre, noisy gidgets. Clearlyvisible from where Harry had perched himself on his chair’s arm wasa truncated-conical object, like a cone with its top snipped off, slowlyspinning around a pulsating central light which it shaded but did notobscure; and each time the inner light pulsated, the assembly made avroop-vroop-vroop sound that sounded oddly distant, muffled like it wascoming from behind four solid walls, even though the spinning-conicalsection thingy was only a meter or two away.Vroop… vroop… vroop…And then there were the various still-breathing bodies of Harry Potterhe’d stashed in one quiet corner, cleaning up a mess that was his own inmore ways than one. (Only one body wasn’t inside a copy of the Invisibil* 1435 *ity Cloak; but then it merely took a small effort of concentration for Harryto perceive his other selves beneath the Cloak of which he was master—an effort which Harry had carefully not put forth earlier, to avoid gettingadvance temporal information he wanted to determine by his own decision.) The sad thing was that by this point, having his own body visiblylying in a corner didn’t seem all that crazy. It was just… Hogwarts.“All right, then,” Moody said, looking rather sour about it. Fromwithin his leather armor, the scarred man took out a black folder. “This isa copy of what Amelia’s people put together. She almost certainly knowswe’ve got it, but it’s all off the books, that clear? Anyway—”And Moody told them who the Department of Magical Law Enforcement thought ‘Quirinus Quirrell’ really was. A seemingly ordinaryHogwarts student (though talented enough that he’d been only narrowlybeaten out for the Head Boy position) who’d gone vacationing in Albaniaafter his graduation, disappeared, returned after 25 years, and then beencaught up in the Wizarding War—“It was murdering the House of Monroe that made Voldie’s name,”Moody said. “Until then, he was just another Dark Wizard with delusionsof grandeur and Bellatrix Black. But after that—” Moody snorted. “Everyfool in the country flocked to serve him. You would’ve hoped the Wizengamot would turn serious, once they realized Voldie was willing to killtheir own sacred selves. And that’s just what the bastards did—hope thatsome other bastard would turn serious. None of the cowards wanted tostep in front. It was Monroe, Crouch, Bones, and Longbottom. That wasnearly everyone in the Ministry who’d dare say a word that might giveVoldie offense.”“That was how your House came to be ennobled, Mr. Potter,” injectedthe solemn voice of Professor McGonagall. “There is an ancient law thatif anyone ends a Most Ancient House, whoever avenges that blood will bemade Noble. To be sure, the House of Potter was already older than somelines called Ancient. But yours was titled a Noble House of Britain afterthe end of the war, in recognition that you had avenged the Most AncientHouse of Monroe.”“Flush of gratitude and all that,” Mad-Eye Moody said sourly. “Itdidn’t last, but at least James and Lily got a fancy title and a useless medalto take to their graves. But that’s leaving out eight years of completehorror after Monroe disappeared and Regulus Black—he was Monroe’sprivate source in the Death Eaters, we’re pretty sure—was executed byVoldie. Like a dam breaking and gore flooding out, drowning the wholecountry. Albus bloody Dumbledore himself had to step into Monroe’sshoes, and that was barely enough for us to survive.”Harry listened with an odd sense of unreality. Some of it felt right,matched up with observation—especially with the speech Professor Quirrell had made before Christmas—and yet…This was Professor Quirrell they were talking about.“So that’s who the Department thinks is your Defense Professor,”Mad-Eye Moody finished up his account. “Now what do you think, son?”“Well…” Harry said slowly. It is also possible to have a mask behind themask. “The obvious next thought is that this ‘David Monroe’ person diedin the war after all, and this is just someone else pretending to be DavidMonroe pretending to be Quirinus Quirrell.”“That’s obvious?” said Professor McGonagall. “Dear Merlin…”“Really, boy?” said Mad-Eye Moody, his blue eye spinning rapidly. “I’dsay that’s a little… paranoid.”You don’t know Professor Quirrell, Harry did not say. “It’s an easy theory to test,” Harry said out loud. “Just check whether the Defense Professor remembers something about the war that the real David Monroewould’ve known. Though I suppose, if he’s playing the part of David Monroe pretending to be someone else, he has a good excuse to pretend he’s pretending he doesn’t know what you’re talking about—”“A little paranoid,” said the scarred man, his voice rising. “Not paranoid enough! CONSTANT VIGILANCE! Think about it, lad—what if the realDavid Monroe never came back from Albania?”There was a pause.“I see…” Harry said.“Of course you do,” Professor McGonagall said. “Don’t mind me,please. I’ll just sit here quietly going mad.”“In this line of work, if you survive, you learn that there’s three kindsof Dark Wizards,” Moody said grimly; his wand wasn’t pointed at anyone, it was angled slightly downward, but it was in his hand. It hadnever left his hand since the moment he’d entered the room. “There’sDark Wizards that have one name. There’s Dark Wizards that have twonames. And there’s Dark Wizards that change names like you and Ichange clothes. I saw ‘Monroe’ go through three Death Eaters like he wassnapping twigs. There’s not many wizards that good at age forty-five.Dumbledore, maybe, but not many others.”“Perhaps that is true,” said the Potions Master from where he was lurking. “But what of it, Mad-Eye? Whatever his identity, Monroe was surelythe Dark Lord’s enemy. I’ve heard Death Eaters curse his name even afterthey thought him dead. They feared him well.”“So far as Defense Professors are concerned,” Professor McGonagallsaid primly, “I shall take it and be grateful.”Moody swung around to glare at her. “Just where the devil was ‘Monroe’ all those years he was gone, eh? Maybe he thought he could make aname for himself in Britain by opposing Voldie, and vanished away whenhe found out he was wrong. Then why’d he come back now, hah? What’shis new plan?”“He, ah…” Harry ventured tentatively. “He says he always wanted tobe a great Defense Professor because all the best fighting wizards havetaught at Hogwarts. And he kind of is being an incredibly good DefenseProfessor, actually… I mean, if he just wanted to keep up a disguise, hecould get away with much sloppier work…”Professor McGonagall was nodding firmly.“Naive,” Moody said flatly. “I suppose you all haven’t wondered if yourDefense Professor set up the whole House of Monroe to be wiped out?”“What?” cried Professor McGonagall.“Our mystery wizard hears about a missing kid from a Most AncientHouse of Britain,” Moody said. “Steps into the shoes of ‘David Monroe’,but stays away from the real Monroe family. But eventually the Houseis bound to notice something wrong. So this imposter somehow prodsVoldie into wiping them all out—maybe leaked a password they’d givenhim for their wards—and then he was a Lord of the Wizengamot!”There seemed to be a fight going on inside Harry’s mind between Hufflepuff One, who’d never trusted the Defense Professor in the first place;and Hufflepuff Two, who was far too loyal to Harry’s friend, ProfessorQuirrell, to believe something like that just because Moody said so.It is kind of obvious, though, observed his Slytherin part. I mean, do youactually believe that under natural circumstances, anyone would end up as thelast heir to a Most Ancient House AND Lord Voldemort killed his family ANDhe has to avenge his martial arts sensei? If anything I’d say he went too far overthe top in setting up his new identity as the ideal literary hero. That sort of thingdoesn’t happen in real life.This from an orphan who was raised unaware of his heritage, commentedHarry’s Inner Critic. With a prophecy about him. You know, I don’t think we’veever read a story about two equally destined heroes competing to see who’s clichedenough to take down the villain—Yes, replied the central Harry over the distant vroop-ing noise in thebackground, it’s a very sad life we lead and YOU’RE NOT HELPING.There’s only one thing to do at this point, said Ravenclaw. And we all knowwhat it is, so why argue?But, Harry replied, how do we test experimentally whether or not ProfessorQuirrell is the original David Monroe? I mean, what sort of observable behavesdifferently, depending on whether he’s the real David Monroe or an impostor?“What do you want me to do about it, Mad-Eye?” Professor McGonagall was demanding. “I can’t—”“You can,” the scarred man said, glaring at her fiercely. “Just fire thebloody Defense Professor.”“You say that every year,” said Professor McGonagall.“Yes, and I’m always right!”“Constant vigilance or no, Alastor, the students must be taught!”Moody snorted. “Pfah! I swear the curse gets worse every year, as youlot get more and more reluctant to let them go. Your precious ProfessorQuirrell would have to be Grindelwald in disguise, to get himself sent off!”“Is he?” Harry couldn’t help asking. “I mean, could he actually be—”“I check Grindie’s cell every two months,” Moody said. “He was therein March.”“Could the person in the cell be a ringer?”“I administer a blood test for his identity, son.”“Where do you keep the blood you use as a reference?”“In a safe place.” Something like a smile was stretching the scarredlips. “Have you considered the Auror Office after you graduate?”“Alastor,” Professor McGonagall said reluctantly. “The Defense Professor does have a… health condition. I suppose you will call it suspiciousin itself—but it is by no means certain that it will be any ill-doing on hispart which prevents us from renewing his employment.”“Yes, his little naptimes,” Moody said darkly. “Amelia thinks hestepped into the path of a high-level curse. Sounds to me more like aDark ritual gone wrong!”“You’ve no proof of that!” Professor McGonagall said.“That man might as well be wearing a sign saying ‘Dark Wizard’ inglowing green letters over his head.”“Ah…” Harry said. It didn’t seem like an especially good time to askwhat Mr. Moody thought of the ‘not all sacrificial rituals are evil’ standpoint. “Excuse me, but you said earlier that Professor Quirrell—I meanthe old David Monroe—I mean the Monroe from the seventies—anyway,you said that person used the Killing Curse. What does that imply? Doessomebody have to be a Dark Wizard to use it?”Moody shook his head. “I’ve used it myself. All it takes is power anda certain mood.” The grimacing lips were showing teeth. “The first timeI cast it was against a wizard named Gerald Grice, and you can ask mewhat he did after you graduate Hogwarts.”“But why is it Unforgiveable, then?” Harry said. “I mean, a CuttingHex can kill someone too. So why’s it any better to use a Reducto insteadof Avada Kedav—”“Shut your mouth!” Moody said sharply. “Someone might take it thewrong way, your saying that incantation. You look too young to cast it,but there’s such a thing as Polyjuice. And to answer your question, boy,there’s two reasons why that spell’s in the blackest book. The first is thatthe Killing Curse strikes directly at the soul, and it’ll just keep going untilit hits one. Straight through shields. Straight through walls. There’s areason why even Aurors fighting Death Eaters weren’t allowed to use itbefore the Monroe Act.”“Ah,” said Harry. “That does seem like an excellent reason to ban—”“I’m not finished, son. The second reason is that the Killing Cursedoesn’t just take a powerful bit of magic. You’ve got to mean it. You’vegot to want someone dead, and not for the greater good, either. KillingGrice didn’t bring back Blair Roche, or Nathan Rehfuss, or David Capito.It wasn’t for justice, or to stop him doing it again. I wanted him dead. Youunderstand now, lad? You don’t have to be a Dark Wizard to use thatspell—but you can’t be Albus Dumbledore, either. And if you’re arrestedfor killing with it, there’s no possible defense.”“I… see,” murmured the Boy-Who-Lived. You can’t want the person deadas an instrumental value on the way to some positive future consequence, you can’tcast it if you believe it’s a necessary evil, you have to actually want them dead forthe sake of being dead, as a terminal value in your utility function. “A magicallyembodied preference for death over life, striking within the plane of purelife force… that does sound like a difficult spell to block.”“Not difficult,” Moody snapped. “Impossible.”Harry nodded gravely. “But David Monroe—or whoever—used theKilling Curse against a couple of Death Eaters even before they wiped outhis family. Does that mean he already had to hate them? Like, the martialarts story was probably true?”Moody shook his head slightly. “One of the dark truths of the KillingCurse, son, is that once you’ve cast it the first time, it doesn’t take muchhate to do it again.”“It damages the mind?”Again Moody shook his head. “No. It’s the killing that does that. Murder tears the soul—but that’s just the same if it’s a Cutting Hex. TheKilling Curse doesn’t crack your soul. It just takes a cracked soul to cast.”If there was a sad expression on the scarred face, it could not be read. “Butthat doesn’t tell us much about Monroe. The ones like Dumbledore who’llnever be able to cast the Curse all their lives, because they never crack nomatter what—they’re the rare ones, very rare. It only takes a little cracking.”There was a strange heavy feeling in Harry’s chest. He’d wonderedwhat exactly it had meant, that Lily Potter had tried to cast the KillingCurse at Lord Voldemort with her last breath. But surely it was forgiveable, it was right and proper for a mother to hate the Dark Wizard who was1441 *coming to kill her baby, mocking her for how she couldn’t stop him. Therewas something wrong with you as a parent if you couldn’t cast Avada Kedavra, in that situation. And no other spell could’ve gone past the DarkLord’s shields; you’d have to at least try to hate the Dark Lord enough towant him dead for the sake of dead, if that was the only way to save yourbaby.It only takes a little cracking…“Enough,” said Professor McGonagall. “What would you have us do?”Moody’s smile twisted. “Get rid of the Defense Professor and see if allyour troubles mysteriously clear up. Bet you a Galleon they do.”Professor McGonagall looked like she was in pain. “Alastor—but—will you teach the classes, if—”“Ha!” said Moody. “If I ever say yes to that question, check me forPolyjuice, because it’s not me.”“I’ll test it experimentally,” Harry said. And then, as everyone lookedat him, “I’ll ask Professor Quirrell a question that the real David Monroewould know—like who else was in the Slytherin class of 1945, or something like that—hopefully without making it obvious. It won’t be definitive proof, he could’ve studied the role, but it would be evidence. Still,Mr. Moody, even if Professor Quirrell isn’t the original Monroe, I’m notsure that getting rid of him is a free action. He saved my life twice—”“What?” demanded Moody. “When? How?”“Once when he knocked down a bunch of witches who were summoning me toward the ground, once when he figured out that the Dementorwas draining me through my wand. And if Professor Quirrell wasn’t theone who set up Draco Malfoy in the first place, then he saved Draco Malfoy’s life, and things would be a lot worse if he hadn’t. If the DefenseProfessor isn’t behind it all—he’s not someone we can afford to just getrid of.”Professor McGonagall nodded firmly.Hypothesis: Severus Snape(April 8th, 1992, 9:03pm)Harry and Professor McGonagall now stood on the slowly turningstairs, turning without descending; or at least one Harry stood upon thosestairs—his other three selves had been left behind in the Headmaster’s office.“Can I ask you a private question?” Harry said, when he thought theywere far enough away not to be heard. “And in particular, private fromthe Headmaster.”“Yes,” Professor McGonagall said, not quite sighing. “Though I hopeyou realize that I cannot do anything which conflicts with my duties to—”“Yes,” Harry said, “that’s exactly what I need to ask you about. In frontof the Wizengamot, when Lucius Malfoy was saying that Hermione wasno part of House Potter and that he wouldn’t take the money, you toldHermione how to swear that oath. I want to know, if something like thatcomes up again, if your first duty is to the Hogwarts student HermioneGranger, or to the head of the Order of the Phoenix, Albus Dumbledore.”Professor McGonagall looked like someone had hit her in the facewith a cast-iron frying-pan, a few minutes earlier, and now she’d beentold that somebody was about to do it again, and not to flinch.Harry flinched a little himself. Somewhere along the line he neededto pick up the knack of not phrasing things to hit as hard as he possiblycould.The walls rotated around them, behind them, and somehow, they descended.“Oh, Mr. Potter,” Professor McGonagall said with a low exhalation.“I… wish you wouldn’t ask me such questions… oh, Harry, I wasn’t thinking then, not at all. I only saw a chance to help Miss Granger and… I wasSorted into Gryffindor, after all.”“You’ve got a chance to think now,” Harry said. It was all coming outwrong, but he had to say it anyway, because—“I’m not asking you to beloyal to me. But if you do know—if you are sure—what you’ll do if it comesdown to an innocent Hogwarts student versus the Order of the Phoenixa second time…”But Professor McGonagall shook her head. “I’m not sure,” the Transfiguration Professor whispered. “I don’t know if it was the right choiceeven then. I’m sorry. I can’t decide such awful things!”“But you’ll do something if it happens again,” Harry said. “Indecisionis also a choice. You can’t just imagine having to make an immediate decision?”“No,” Professor McGonagall said, sounding a little stronger; andHarry realized that he’d accidentally offered a way out. The Professor’snext words confirmed Harry’s fears. “Such a dreadful choice as that,Mr. Potter—I think I should not make it until I must.”Harry gave an internal sigh. He supposed he had no right to expectProfessor McGonagall to say anything else. In a moral dilemma whereyou lost something either way, making the choice would feel bad eitherway, so you could temporarily save yourself a little mental pain by refusing to decide. At the cost of not being able to plan anything in advance,and at the cost of incurring a huge bias toward inaction or waiting until too late… but you couldn’t expect a witch to know all that. “All right,”Harry said.Though it wasn’t right at all, not really. Dumbledore might want thatdebt removed, Professor Quirrell would also want Harry out of that debt.And if the Defense Professor was David Monroe, or could convincinglyappear to be David Monroe, then Lord Voldemort technically hadn’t exterminated the House of Monroe. In which case somebody might be able topass a Wizengamot resolution revoking the Noble status of House Potter,which had been granted for avenging the Most Ancient House of Monroe.In which case Hermione’s vow of service to a Noble House might benull and void.Or maybe not. Harry didn’t know anything about the legalities, especially not whether House Potter got the money back if someone managedto send Hermione to Azkaban. Just because you lost something mightnot mean the payment was returned, legally speaking. Harry wasn’t sureand he didn’t dare ask a magical solicitor……it would have been nice to be able to trust at least one adult to takeHermione’s side instead of Dumbledore’s, if an issue like that threatenedto come up.The stairs they were upon ceased rotating, and they were before thebacks of the great stone gargoyles, which rumbled aside, revealing thehallway.Harry stepped out—A hand caught at Harry’s shoulder.“Mr. Potter,” Professor McGonagall said in a low voice, “why did youto tell me to keep watch over Professor Snape?”Harry turned around again.“You told me to keep watch, and see if he’d changed,” Professor McGonagall went on, her tone urgent. “Why did you say that, Mr. Potter?”It took a moment, at this point, for Harry to think back and rememberwhy he had said that. Harry and Neville had rescued Lesath Lestrangefrom bullies, and then Harry had confronted Severus in the hallway and,at least according to the Potions Master’s own words, ‘almost died’—“I learned something that made me worry,” Harry said after a moment. “From someone who made me promise not to tell anyone else.”Severus had made Harry swear that their conversations wouldn’t beshared with anyone, and Harry was still bound by it.“Mr. Potter—” began Professor McGonagall, and then exhaled, theflash of sharpness disappearing as quickly as it had come. “Never mind.If you cannot say, you cannot say.”“Why do you ask?” Harry said.Professor McGonagall seemed to hesitate—“All right, let me be more specific,” Harry said. After Professor Quirrell had done it to him several times, Harry was starting to get the hangof it. “What change have you already observed in Professor Snape thatyou’re trying to decide whether to tell me about?”“Harry—” the Transfiguration Professor said, and then closed hermouth.“I obviously know something you don’t,” Harry said helpfully. “See, thisis why we can’t always put off trying to decide our awful moral dilemmas.”Professor McGonagall closed her eyes, drew in a deep breath, pinchedthe bridge of her nose and squeezed it several times. “All right,” she said.“It’s a subtle thing… but worrying. How can I put this… Mr. Potter, haveyou read many books that young children are not meant to read?”“I’ve read all of them.”“Of course you have. Well… I don’t quite understand it myself, butfor so long as Severus has been employed in this school, stalking about inthat awful stained cloak, there has been a certain sort of girl that stares athim with longing eyes—”“You say that like it’s a bad thing?” Harry said. “I mean, if there’s onething I did understand from those books, it’s that you’re not supposed toquestion people’s preferences.”Professor McGonagall gave Harry a very strange look.“I mean,” Harry said again, “from what I’ve read, when I’m a bit olderthere’s something like a 10% chance that I’ll find Professor Snape attractive, and the important thing is for me to just accept whatever I—”“In any case, Mr. Potter, Severus has always been entirely indifferentto the stares of those young girls. But now—” Professor McGonagallseemed to realize something, and hastily said, her hands rising in warding, “Please don’t mistake me, Professor Snape certainly has not takenadvantage of any young witches! Absolutely not! He has never even somuch as smiled at one, not that I ever heard. He has told the young girlsto stop gaping at him. And if they stare at him regardless, he looks away.That I have seen with my own eyes.”“Er…” Harry said. “Sorry, but just because I’ve read those books doesn’tmean I understood them. What does all that mean?”“That he is noticing,” Professor McGonagall said in a low voice. “It is asubtle thing, but now that I have seen it, I am certain. And that means… Iam very much afraid… that the bond which held Severus to Albus’s cause…may have weakened, or even broken.”2 + 2 =…“Snape and Dumbledore?” Then Harry heard the words that had justcome out of his mouth, and hastily added, “Not that there’s anythingwrong with that—”“No!” said Professor McGonagall. “Oh, for pity’s sake—I can’t explainit to you, Mr. Potter!”The other shoe finally dropped.He was still in love with my mother?This seemed somewhere between beautifully sad, and pathetic, foraround five seconds before the third shoe dropped.Of course, that was before I gave him my helpful relationship advice.“I see,” Harry said carefully after a few moments. There were timeswhen saying ‘Oops’ didn’t fully cover it. “You’re right, that’s not a goodsign.”Professor McGonagall put both hands over her face. “Whatever you’rethinking right now,” she said in a slightly muffled voice, “which I assureyou is also wrong, I don’t want to hear about it, ever.”“So…” Harry said. “If, like you said, the bond that held ProfessorSnape to the Headmaster has broken… what would he do then?”There was a long silence.What would he do then?Minerva lowered her hands, gazing down at the upturned face of theBoy-Who-Lived. One simple question shouldn’t have caused her so muchdismay. She’d known Severus for years; the two of them bound, in somestrange way, by the prophecy they’d both heard. Though Minerva suspected, from what she knew of the rules of prophecy, that she had onlyoverheard it herself. It had been Severus’s acts which had brought aboutthe prophecy’s fulfillment. And the guilt, the heartbreak which had comeof that choice, had been tormenting the Potions Master for years. Shecouldn’t imagine who Severus would be without it. Her mind went blank,trying to imagine; her thoughts an empty parchment.Surely Severus was no longer the man he’d once been, that angry andterribly foolish young man who’d brought the prophecy before Voldemortin exchange for being admitted into the Death Eaters. She’d known himfor years, and surely Severus was no longer that man…Did she really know him at all?Had anyone ever seen the real Severus Snape?“I don’t know,” Professor McGonagall finally said. “I truly don’t know atall. I can’t even imagine. Do you know anything of this, Mr. Potter?”“Er…” Harry said. “I think I can say that my own evidence points inthe same direction as yours. I mean, it increases the probability that Professor Snape isn’t in love with my mother anymore.”Professor McGonagall closed her eyes. “I give up.”“I don’t know of anything wrong he’s done apart from that, though,”Harry added. “I assume the Headmaster cleared you to ask me aboutthis?”Professor McGonagall looked away from him, staring at the wall.“Please don’t, Harry.”“All right,” Harry said, and turned and hurried out into the hallways,hearing Professor McGonagall more slowly walking after, and the rumbling sound of the gargoyles moving into place.It was the morning after next, during Potions class, that Harry’s potion ofcold resistance boiled over his cauldron with a green froth and mildly nauseating smell, and Professor Snape, looking more resigned than disgusted,told Harry to stay after class. Harry had his own suspicions about this affair, and as soon as class let out—Hermione, as usual for the last few days,being the first to flee out the door—the door swung shut and locked behind the departing students.“I apologize for ruining your potion, Mr. Potter,” Severus Snape saidquietly. There was upon his face the strange sad look that Harry had seenonly once before, in a hallway some time ago. “It will not be reflected inyour grades. Please, sit down.”Harry sat back down at his desk, filling up the time by scrubbing abit more at the green stain on the wooden surface, as the Potions Masterincanted a few privacy spells.When the Potions Master was done, he spoke again. “I… do not knowhow to broach this topic, Mr. Potter, so I will simply say it… before theDementor, you recovered your memory of the night your parents died?”Harry silently nodded.“If… I know it must not be a pleasant memory, but… if you could tellme what happened…?”“Why?” Harry said. His voice was solemn, definitely not mocking thepleading look that Harry had never expected to see from that person.“I wouldn’t think that would be a pleasant thing for you to hear either,Professor—”The Potions Master’s voice was almost a whisper. “I have imagined itevery night these last ten years.”You know, said Harry’s Slytherin side, it might not be such a good idea togive him closure, if his guilt-based loyalties are already wavering—Shut up. Overruled.It wasn’t something that Harry could actually bring himself to deny.He took one suggestion from his Slytherin side, and that was it.“Will you tell me exactly how you came to learn about the Prophecy?”Harry said. “I’m sorry to make this a trade, I will tell you afterward, only,it could be really important—”“There is little to say. I had come to be interviewed by the DeputyHeadmistress for the position of Potions Master, and so I was waitingoutside the room of the Hog’s Head Inn when the applicant before me,Sybill Trelawney, came to seek the position of Professor of Divination.As soon as Trelawney finished speaking her words, I fled, forsaking mychance at Hogwarts’s Mastery, and went to the Dark Lord.” The PotionsMaster’s face was drawn and tight. “I did not even pause to consider whythat riddle might have come to me, before I sold it to another.”“A job interview?” Harry said. “Where you and Professor Trelawneyboth happened to be applying, and Professor McGonagall was interviewing? That seems… like rather a large coincidence…”“Seers are the pawns of time, Mr. Potter. Coincidence is beneaththem, and they are above it. I was the one meant to hear that prophecyand become its fool. Minerva’s presence made no final difference to howit came about. There was no Memory Charm as you supposed, I do notknow why you thought that, but there was no Memory-Charm, therecould have been no Memory-Charm. The voice of a seer has a quality, anenigma which even Legilimency cannot share, how could that be imbuedin a false memory? Do you think the Dark Lord would believe my merewords? The Dark Lord seized my mind and saw the mystification there,even if he could not seize the mystery, and so he knew the prophecy hadbeen true. The Dark Lord could have killed me then, having taken whathe wanted—I was a fool indeed to go to him—but he saw something inme I do not know, and took me into the Death Eaters, though on histerms rather than mine. That is how I brought it about, brought it allabout, from beginning to end, always my own doing.” Severus’s voicehad gone rather hoarse, and his face was filled with naked pain. “Nowtell me, please, how did Lily die?”Harry swallowed twice, and began his recounting.“James Potter shouted for Lily to run away with me, that he wouldhold off You-Know-Who.”“You-Know-Who said—” Harry stopped, the chills going all over hisown skin, his own muscles tightening as if in preparing for a seizure. Thememory was returning strongly, now, accompanied by cold and darknessin association. “He used… the Killing Curse… and then he came upstairssomehow, I think he must have flown, I don’t remember any footstepson stairs or anything like that… and then my mother said, ‘No, not Harry,please not Harry!’ or something like that. And the Dark Lord—his voicewas so high, like water whistling out of a teakettle only cold—the DarkLord said—”Stand aside, woman! For you I am not come, only the boy.The words were very clear in Harry’s memory.“—he told my mother to get out of his way, that he was only there forme, and my mother begged him to have mercy, and the Dark Lord said—”I give you this rare chance to flee.“—that he was being generous and giving her a chance to run, buthe wouldn’t bother fighting her, and even if she died, she couldn’t saveme—” Harry’s voice was unsteady, “—and so she ought to get out of hisway. And that was when my mother begged the Dark Lord to take her lifeinstead of mine—and the Dark Lord—the Dark Lord said to her—and hisvoice was lower this time, like he was dropping a pose—”Very well, I accept the bargain.“—he said that he accepted her offer, and that she should drop herwand so he could kill her. And then the Dark Lord waited, just waited. I,I don’t know what Lily Potter was thinking, it hadn’t even made sense inthe first place, what she said, it wasn’t like the Dark Lord would kill herand then just leave, when he’d come there for me. Lily Potter didn’t sayanything, and then the Dark Lord started laughing at her and it was horrible and—and she finally tried the only thing left that wasn’t abandoningme or just giving up and dying. I don’t know if she even could’ve, if thespell would’ve worked for her, but when you think about, she had to try.The last thing my mother said was ‘Avada Ke-’ but the Dark Lord startedhis own curse as soon as she said ‘Av’ and he said it in less than half a second and there was a flash of green light and then—and then—and then—”“That’s enough.”Slowly, like a body floating to the surface of water, Harry returnedfrom wherever he’d been.“That’s enough,” the Potions Master said hoarsely. “She died… Lilydied without pain, then? The Dark Lord… did not do anything to her, before she died?”She died thinking that she’d failed, and that the Dark Lord was going to killher baby next. That’s pain.“He—the Dark Lord didn’t torture her—” Harry said. “If that’s whatyou’re asking.”Behind Harry, the door unlocked itself and swung open.Harry left.It was Friday, April 10th, of 1992.1451 *Thursday, April 16th, 1992.he school was almost deserted now, nine-tenths of the students having gone home for the Easter holiday, just about everyone she knewmissing. Susan had stayed behind, her grand-aunt being quite busy, ashad Ron for reasons she didn’t know—maybe the Weasley family waspoor enough that feeding all the children for an extra week would’ve beena noticeable strain? It all worked out well enough, since Ron and Susanwere just about the only ones left who’d still talk to her. (At least thatshe wanted to talk back to. Lavender was still nice to her, and Traceywas, um, Tracey, but neither of them were quite relaxing to spend a freehour around; and in any case, neither of those two had stayed over for theEaster hols.)If she couldn’t go home—and she wasn’t allowed to go home, her parents had been lied-to and told she’d had Glowpox—then an almost-emptyHogwarts was the next best thing.She could even visit the library without people staring at her, sincethere were no lessons and nobody was trying to do schoolwork.It would be a mistake to think that Hermione drooped about the corridors weeping all day long. Oh, she’d cried a lot the first two days, ofcourse, but two days had been enough. There were parts of Harry’s borrowed books about that, how even people who were paralyzed in car accidents weren’t nearly as unhappy as they’d expected to be, six monthslater, just like lottery winners weren’t nearly as happy as they’d expected.People adjusted, their happiness levels went back to their happiness setpoint, life went on.A shadow fell over where Hermione was reading her current book andshe whirled around, the wand hidden on her lap coming up to point directly at the surprised face of—“Sorry!” Harry Potter said, hastily holding up his palms to show hisleft hand empty, and his right hand holding a small red-velvet pouch.“Sorry. Didn’t mean to startle you.”There was an awful silence, her heartbeat increasing and her palmsstarting to sweat as Harry Potter just looked at her. She’d almost talkedto him, on the first morning of the rest of her life; but when she’d comedown to breakfast Harry Potter had looked so awful—so she hadn’t satdown beside him at the breakfast-table, just quietly eaten in her own little bubble of nobody else sitting next to her, and it had been horrible, butHarry hadn’t come to her, and… she just hadn’t talked to him, since then.(It wasn’t hard to avoid everyone, if you stayed out of the Ravenclaw common room, and ran out of classes before anyone could talk to you.)And ever since she’d been wondering what Harry thought of hernow—if he hated her for having lost all his money—or if he really was inlove with her and that’s why he’d done it—or if he’d given up on her keeping pace with him because she couldn’t frighten Dementors—she couldn’tface him now, she just couldn’t, she spent sleepless nights worrying whatHarry thought of her now, and she was afraid, and she’d been avoidingthe boy who’d spent all his money to save her, and she was a horribleungrateful wretch, and a terrible person and—Then her eyes glanced down to see that Harry was reaching into thered-velvet pouch and taking out a heart-shaped red-foil-wrapped sweet,and her brain melted down like chocolate left out in the sun.“I was going to give you more space,” said Harry Potter, “only I wasreading up on Critch’s theories about hedonics and how to train your inner pigeon and how small immediate positive and negative feedbacks secretly control most of what we actually do, and it occurred to me that youmight be avoiding me because seeing me made you think of things thatfelt like negative associations, and I really didn’t want to let that run anylonger without doing something about it, so I got ahold of a bag of chocolates from the Weasley twins and I’m just going to give you one every timeyou see me as a positive reinforcement if that’s all right with you—”“Breathe, Harry,” Hermione said without thinking about it.It was the first word she’d spoken to him since the day of the trial.The two of them stared at each other.The books stared at them from the surrounding shelves.They stared some more at each other.“You’re supposed to eat the chocolate,” Harry said, holding out theheart-shaped sweet like a Valentine. “Unless just being given a chocolatefeels good enough to count as a positive reinforcement, in which case youprobably need to put it in your pocket or something.”She knew that if she tried speaking again she’d fail, so she didn’t try.Harry’s head slumped a bit. “Do you hate me now?”“No!” she said. “No, you shouldn’t think that, Harry! Just—just—justeverything!” She realized that her wand was still pointed at Harry, andshe lowered it. She was trying very hard not to burst out into tears. “Everything!” she repeated, and couldn’t find any better to say than that, although she was certain that Harry wanted to tell her to be specific.“I think I understand,” Harry said cautiously. “What’re you reading?”Before she could stop him, them, Harry bent over the library-desk tosee the book she was reading, leaning his head forward before she couldthink to grab the book away—Harry stared at the open page.“The World’s Wealthiest Wizards and How They Got That Way,”Harry read off the book’s title from the top. “Number sixty-five, SirGareth, owner of a transportation company that won the 19th-centuryshipping wars… monopoly on oh-tee-threes… I see.”“I s’pose you’re going to tell me that I don’t need to worry about anything and you’ll take care of it all?” It came out sounding harsher thanshe would’ve wanted, and she felt another stab of guilt for being such aterrible person.“Nah,” Harry said, sounding oddly cheerful. “I can put myself in yourshoes well enough to know that if you paid a bunch of money to save me,I’d be trying to pay it back. I’d know it was silly on some level, and I’d stillbe trying to pay it back all by myself. There’s no way I wouldn’t understand that, Hermione.”Hermione’s face screwed up and she felt moisture in the corners ofher eyes.“Fair warning, though,” Harry went on, “I might solve the debt to Lucius Malfoy myself if I see a way before you do, it’s more important toget that sorted immediately than which one of us gets it sorted. Anythinginteresting so far?”Three-quarters of her was running in circles and smashing into treesas she tried to figure out the implications of everything Harry had justsaid (did he still respect her as a heroine? or did that mean he thought shecouldn’t do it on her own?) and meanwhile a much more sensible part ofHermione flipped back the book to page 37 which had the most promisingentry she’d seen so far (though in her imagination she always did it on herown and took Harry completely by surprise)—“I thought this seemed quite interesting,” her voice said.“Number fourteen, ‘Crozier’, true name unknown,” Harry read.“Wow, that is… that is the gaudiest checkered top hat I’ve ever seen.Wealth, at least six hundred thousand Galleons… so around thirty million pounds, not enough to make a Muggle famous, but good enough forthe smaller wizard population, I guess. Rumored to be a modern alias ofthe six-century-old Nicholas Flamel, the only known wizard to succeedat the incredibly difficult alchemical procedure for creating the Philosopher’s Stone, which enables the transmutation of base metals into gold orsilver as well as… the Elixir of Life which indefinitely prolongs the youthand health of the user… Um, Hermione, this seems obviously false.”“I’ve read more references to Nicholas Flamel,” Hermione said. “TheRise and Fall of the Dark Arts says he secretly trained Dumbledore to standup to Grindelwald. There’s a lot of books that take the story seriously, notjust this one… you think it’s too good to be true?”“No, of course not,” said Harry. Harry pulled out the chair next toher own, at the small table, and sat down beside her in his accustomedplace on her right, just like he’d never left; she had to choke back a catchin her throat. “The idea of ‘too good to be true’ isn’t causal reasoning, theuniverse doesn’t check if the output of the equations is ‘too good’ or ‘toobad’ before allowing it. People used to think that airplanes and smallpoxvaccines were too good to be true. Muggles have figured out ways to travelto other stars without even using magic, and you and I can use our wandsto do things that Muggle physicists think are literally impossible. I can’teven imagine what we could rule out the real laws of magic being able todo.”“So what’s the problem, then?” Hermione said. Her voice soundedmore normal now, in her own ears.“Well…” Harry said. The boy reached over her own outstretched arm,his robes brushing hers, and tapped the artist’s illustration of an ominously glowing red stone dripping scarlet liquid. “Problem one is thatthere’s no logical reason why the same artifact would be able to transmutelead to gold and produce an elixir that kept someone young. I wonder ifthere’s an official name for that in the literature? Like the ‘turned up toeleven effect’, maybe? If everyone can see a flower, you can’t get awaywith saying flowers are the size of houses. But if you’re in a flying saucercult, since nobody can see the alien mothership anyway, you can say it’sthe size of a city, or the size of the Moon. Observable things have to beconstrained by evidence, but when somebody makes up a story, they canmake the story as extreme as they want. So the Philosopher’s Stone givesyou unlimited gold and eternal life, not because there’s a single magicaldiscovery that would produce both of those effects, but because someonemade up a story about a super happy thingy.”“Harry, there’s a lot of things in magic that aren’t sensible,” she said.“Granted,” said Harry. “But Hermione, problem two is that not evenwizards are crazy enough to casually overlook the implications of this. Everyone would be trying to rediscover the formula for the Philosopher’sStone, whole countries would be trying to capture the immortal wizardand get the secret out of him—”“It’s not a secret.” Hermione flipped the page, showing Harry the diagrams. “The instructions are right on the next page. It’s just so difficultthat only Nicholas Flamel’s done it.”“So entire countries would be trying to kidnap Flamel and force himto make more Stones. Come on, Hermione, even wizards wouldn’t hearabout immortality and, and,” Harry Potter paused, his eloquence apparently failing him, “and just keep going. Humans are crazy, but they’re notthat crazy!”“Not everyone thinks the same way you do, Harry.” He did havea point, but… how many different references had she come across toNicholas Flamel? Besides World’s Wealthiest Wizards and Rise and Fallof the Dark Arts, there’d also been Stories of Moderately Ancient Times andBiographies of the Justly Famous…“All right then, Professor Quirrell would’ve kidnapped this Flamel guy.It’s what an evil person or a good person or just a selfish person would doif they had any sense. The Defense Professor knows a lot of secrets andhe wouldn’t miss that one.” Harry sighed and looked up; she followedhis gaze, but he was apparently just looking at the larger library, the rowsand rows and rows of bookcases. “I don’t mean to mess with your project,”said Harry, “and I certainly don’t mean to discourage you, but… Honestly,Hermione, I’m not sure you’re going to find any good ideas for makingmoney in a book like this. Like the old joke about how if an economistsees a twenty-pound note lying in the street, they won’t bother pickingit up, because if it were real, someone else would’ve picked it up already.Any way of making lots of money that everyone knows about to the pointwhere it’s in books like this… you see what I’m saying? It can’t be possiblefor everyone to make a thousand Galleons a month in three easy steps, oreveryone would be doing it.”“So? That wouldn’t stop you,” Hermione said, her voice now roughening again. “You do impossible things all the time, I bet you’ve done something impossible in the last week and you didn’t bother telling anyone.”(There was a slight pause, which, if Miss Granger had known, wasexactly the length of pause you’d make if you’d fought Mad-Eye Moodyand won exactly eight days earlier.)“Not in the last seven days, no,” Harry said. “Look… part of the trickof doing the impossible is being selective about which impossibilities youchallenge, and only trying when you have a special advantage. If there’sa money-making method in this book that sounds difficult for a wizard,but it’s easy if we can use Dad’s old Mac Plus, then we’d have a plan.”“I know that, Harry,” Hermione said, her voice wavering only slightly.“I was looking to see if there was anything here I could figure out how to do.I thought, maybe the difficult part about making a Philosopher’s Stonewas that the alchemical circle had to be super precise, and I could get itright by using a Muggle microscope—”“That’s brilliant, Hermione!” The boy rapidly drew his wand, said “Quietus,” and then continued after the small noises of the rowdier books haddied down. “Even if the Philosopher’s Stone is just a myth, the same trickmight work for other difficult alchemies—”“Well, it can’t work,” Hermione said. She’d flown across the library tolook up the only book on alchemy that wasn’t in the Restricted Section.And then—she remembered the crushing letdown, all the sudden hopedissipating like mist. “Because all alchemical circles have to be drawn ‘tothe fineness of a child’s hair’, it isn’t any finer for some alchemies thanothers. And wizards have Omnioculars, and I haven’t heard of any spellswhere you use Omnioculars to magnify things and do them exactly. Ishould’ve realized that!”“Hermione,” Harry said seriously, as he started to dig down into thered-velvet pouch again, “don’t punish yourself when a bright idea doesn’twork out. You’ve got to go through a lot of flawed ideas to find one thatmight work. And if you send your brain negative feedback by frowningwhen you think of a flawed idea, instead of realizing that idea-suggestingis good behavior by your brain to be encouraged, pretty soon you won’tthink of any ideas at all.” Harry put down two heart-shaped chocolatesbeside the book. “Here, have another chocolate. Besides the one fromearlier, I mean. This one is to reinforce your brain for generating a goodcandidate strategy.”“I suppose you’re right,” Hermione said in a small voice, but she didn’ttouch the chocolate. She started to turn the pages back to 167, where she’dbeen reading before Harry had come in.(Hermione Granger did not require bookmarks, of course.)Harry was leaning over slightly, his head almost touching her shoulder, watching the pages as she turned them, as though he might be able toglean valuable information from glimpsing the page for only a quartersecond. Breakfast hadn’t been long ago, and she could clearly identify,from the faint scent of his breath, that Harry’d eaten banana pudding fordessert.Harry spoke again. “So with all that said… and please take this as apositive reinforcement… did you really try to invent a way to mass-produceimmortality so that I could pay off my debt to Lucius Malfoy?”“Yes,” she said in an even smaller voice. Even when she tried to thinklike Harry, it seemed she hadn’t yet got the knack of it. “So what’ve youbeen doing this whole time, Harry?”Harry made a disgusted face. “Trying to collect evidence on the whole‘Who Framed Hermione Granger’ mystery.”“I…” Hermione looked up at Harry. “Shouldn’t I… be trying to solve myown mystery, though?” It hadn’t been her first thought, her first priority,but now that Harry mentioned it…“That wouldn’t work in this case,” Harry said soberly. “There’s toomany people who’ll talk to me and not you… and I’m also sorry to say thatsome of them made me promise not to talk to anyone else. Sorry, I don’tthink you can help much on this one.”“Okay, I guess,” Hermione said leadenly. “Fine. You do everything.You gather all the clues and talk to all the suspects while I just sit here inthe library. Let me know after it turns out that it was Professor Quirrellwho did it.”“Hermione…” Harry said. “Why is it so important who does what?Shouldn’t it be more important to get everything solved, than who solvesit?”“I guess you’re right,” Hermione said. She lifted her hands to pressup at her eyes. “I guess it doesn’t matter any more. Everyone’s going tothink—I know it’s not your fault, Harry, you were—you were being Good,you were a perfect gentleman—but no matter what I do now, they’ll allthink that I’m just—someone for you to rescue.” She paused, and said,with her voice quivering, “And maybe they’re right, Harry.”“Whoa, whoa, hold on there a second—”“I can’t scare Dementors. I can get Outstandings in Charms class, butI can’t scare Dementors.”“I’ve got a mysterious dark side!” Harry hissed, after his head turnedaround to scan the library. (There was one boy in a distant corner, whodid look in their direction occasionally, but he would’ve been too far awayto hear anything even without the Quieting Barrier.) “I’ve got a dark sidethat definitely isn’t a child, and who knows what other crazy magical stuffgoing on in my head—Professor Quirrell claimed that I become whoeverI believe I am—that’s all cheating, don’t you see, Hermione? There’s anarrangement that the school administration made that I’m not supposedto talk about, so that the Boy-Who-Lived could have more time to studyevery day, I’m cheating and you’re still beating me in Charms class. I‘m—I’m probably not—the Boy-Who-Lived probably isn’t even something thatyou could properly call a child—and you’re still competing with that. Don’tyou realize, if it wasn’t for people paying attention to me, you’d look likethe most powerful witch to come along in a century? When you can fightthree older bullies by yourself, and win?”“I don’t know,” she said, pressing her hands again over her eyes, withher voice wavering. “All I know is—even if that’s all true—nobody’s evergoing to see me for myself anymore, ever.”“All right,” Harry said after a while. “I see what you mean. Instead ofthe famous Potter-and-Granger research team, there’ll be Harry Potterand his lab assistant. Um… here’s an idea. How about if I don’t focus onmaking money for a while? I mean, the debt doesn’t come due until Igraduate Hogwarts. So you can do it yourself and show the world you’vestill got it. And if you coincidentally crack the secret of immortality alongthe way, we’ll just call it a bonus.”The thought of Harry relying on her to come up with a solutionseemed… like a crushing burden of responsibility to dump on a poortraumatized twelve-year-old girl, and she wanted to hug him for offeringher a way to restore her self-respect as a heroine, and it was what shedeserved for being a horrible person and speaking sharply to Harry all thetime, when all along he’d been a truer friend to her than she’d ever beento him, and it was good that he still thought she could do things, and…“Is there some amazing rational thing you do when your mind’s running in all different directions?” she managed.“My own approach is usually to identify the different desires, givethem names, conceive of them as separate individuals, and let them argue it out inside my head. So far the main persistent ones are my Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, Gryffindor, and Slytherin sides, my Inner Critic, andmy simulated copies of you, Neville, Draco, Professor McGonagall, Professor Flitwick, Professor Quirrell, Dad, Mum, Richard Feynman, andDouglas Hofstadter.”1461 *Hermione considered trying this before her Common Sense warnedthat it might be a dangerous sort of thing to pretend. “There’s a copy ofme inside your head?”“Of course there is!” Harry said. The boy suddenly looked a bit morevulnerable. “You mean there isn’t a copy of me living in your head?”There was, she realized; and not only that, it talked in Harry’s exactvoice.“It’s rather unnerving now that I think about it,” said Hermione. “I dohave a copy of you living in my head. It’s talking to me right now usingyour voice, arguing how this is perfectly normal.”“Good,” Harry said seriously. “I mean, I don’t see how people could befriends without that.”She continued reading her book, then, Harry seeming content towatch the pages over her shoulder.She’d gotten all the way to number seventy, Katherine Scott, who’dapparently invented a way to turn small animals into lemon tarts, whenshe finally worked up the courage to speak.“Harry?” she said. (She was leaning a bit away from him now, thoughshe didn’t realize it.) “If there’s a copy of Draco Malfoy in your head, doesthat mean you’re friends with Draco Malfoy?”“Well…” Harry said. He sighed. “Yeah, I’d been meaning to talk withyou about this anyway. I kind of wish I’d talked to you sooner. Anyway,how can I put this… I was corrupting him?”“What do you mean corrupting?”“Tempting him to the Light Side of the Force.”Her mouth just stayed open.“You know, like the Emperor and Darth Vader, only in reverse.”“Draco Malfoy,” she said. “Harry, do you have any idea—”“Yes.”“—the sort of things Malfoy has been saying about me? What he saidhe’d do to me, as soon as he got the chance? I don’t know what he toldto you, but Daphne Greengrass told me what Malfoy says when he’s inSlytherin. It’s unspeakable, Harry! It’s unspeakable in the completely literal sense that I can’t say it out loud!”“When was this?” Harry said. “At the start of the year? Did Daphnesay when this was?”“No,” Hermione said. “Because it doesn’t matter when, Harry. Anyone who said things—like Malfoy said—they can’t be a good person. Itdoesn’t matter what you tempted him to, he’s still a rotten person, because no matter what a good person would never—”“You’re wrong.” Harry said, looking her straight in the eyes. “I canguess what Draco threatened to do to you, because the second time I methim, he talked about doing it to a ten-year-old girl. But don’t you see, onthe day Draco Malfoy arrived in Hogwarts, he’d spent his whole previouslife being raised by Death Eaters. It would’ve required a supernatural intervention for him to have your morality given his environment—”Hermione was shaking her head violently. “No, Harry. Nobody hasto tell you that hurting people is wrong, it’s not something you don’tdo because the teacher says it’s not allowed, it’s something you don’t dobecause—because you can see when people are hurting, don’t you know that,Harry?” Her voice was shaking now. “That’s not—that’s not a rule peoplefollow like the rules for algebra! If you can’t see it, if you can’t feel it here,”her hand slapped down over the center of her chest, not quite where herheart was located, but that didn’t matter because it was all really in thebrain anyway, “then you just don’t have it!”The thought came to her, then, that Harry might not have it.“There’s history books you haven’t read,” Harry said quietly. “There’sbooks you haven’t read yet, Hermione, and they might give you a sense ofperspective. A few centuries earlier—I think it was definitely still aroundin the seventeenth century—it was a popular village entertainment totake a wicker basket, or a bundle, with a dozen live cats in it, and—”“Stop,” she said.“—roast it over a bonfire. Just a regular celebration. Good cleanfun. And I’ll give them this, it was cleaner fun than burning womenthey thought were witches. Because the way people are built, Hermione,the way people are built to feel inside—” Harry put a hand over his ownheart, in the anatomically correct position, then paused and moved hishand up to point toward his head at around the ear level, “—is that theyhurt when they see their friends hurting. Someone inside their circle ofconcern, a member of their own tribe. That feeling has an off-switch,an off-switch labeled ‘enemy’ or ‘foreigner’ or sometimes just ‘stranger’.That’s how people are, if they don’t learn otherwise. So, no, it does notindicate that Draco Malfoy was inhuman or even unusually evil, if hegrew up believing that it was fun to hurt his enemies—”“If you believe that,” she said with her voice unsteady, “if you can believe that, then you’re evil. People are always responsible for what theydo. It doesn’t matter what anyone tells you to do, you’re the one who doesit. Everyone knows that—”“No they don’t! You grew up in a post-World-War-Two society where ‘Ivas only followink orders’ is something everyone knows the bad guys said.In the fifteenth century they would’ve called it honourable fealty.” Harry’svoice was rising. “Do you think you’re, you’re just genetically better thaneveryone who lived back then? Like if you’d been transported back tofifteenth-century London as a baby, you’d realize all on your own that burning cats was wrong, witch-burning was wrong, slavery was wrong, thatevery sentient being ought to be in your circle of concern? Do you thinkyou’d finish realizing all that by the first day you got to Hogwarts? Nobody ever told Draco he was personally responsible for becoming moreethical than the society he grew up in. And despite that, it only took himfour months to get to the point where he’d grab a Muggleborn falling offa building.” Harry’s eyes were as fierce as she’d ever seen him. “I’m notfinished corrupting Draco Malfoy, but I think he’s done pretty well so far.”The problem with having such a good memory was that she didremember.She remembered Draco Malfoy grabbing her wrist, so hard she’d hada bruise afterward, while she was falling off the roof of Hogwarts.She remembered Draco Malfoy helping her up, after that mysterioustripping jinx had sent her stumbling into the Slytherin Quidditch Captain’s plate of food.And she remembered—it was, in fact, the reason she’d brought up thetopic in the first place—how she’d felt when she’d heard Draco Malfoy’stestimony under Veritaserum.“Why didn’t you tell me any of this?” Hermione said, and despite herself, her voice rose in pitch. “If I’d known—”“It wasn’t my secret to tell you,” Harry said. “Draco’s the one whowould’ve been at risk, if his father had found out.”“I’m not stupid, Mr. Potter. What’s the real reason you didn’t tell me,and what were you actually doing with Mr. Malfoy?”“Ah. Well…” Harry broke eye contact with her, and looked down at thelibrary table.“Draco Malfoy told the Aurors under Veritaserum that he wanted toknow if he could beat me, so he challenged me to a duel to test it empirically.Those were his exact words according to the transcript.”“Right,” Harry said, still not meeting her eyes. “Hermione Granger. Of course she’ll remember the exact wording. It doesn’t matterif she’s chained to her chair, on trial for murder in front of the entireWizengamot—”“What were you really doing with Draco Malfoy?”Harry winced, and said, “Probably not quite what you’re thinking,but…”The horror scaled and scaled within her, and finally broke loose.“You were doing SCIENCE with him?”“Well—”“You were doing SCIENCE with him? You were supposed to be doing sciencewith ME!”“It wasn’t like that! It’s not like I was doing real science with him! Iwas just, you know, teaching him some harmless bits of Muggle science,like elementary physics with algebra and so on—it’s not like I was doingoriginal magical research with him, the way I was with you—”“And I suppose you didn’t tell him about me, either?”“Um, of course not?” Harry said. “I’ve been doing science with himsince October, and he wasn’t exactly ready to hear about you then—”The inexpressible sense of betrayal inside her was welling and welling,taking over everything, her rising voice, her glaring eyes, her nose thatshe was certain was starting to run, the burning in her throat. She shovedherself up from the table and took a step back, the better to look down onher betrayer, and her voice was very nearly screeching as she yelled, “Thatis not okay! You can’t do science with two people at once!”“Er—”“I mean, you can’t do science with two different people and not tellthem about each other!”“Ah…” Harry said cautiously. “I did think of that, and I was very carefulnot to get your research mixed together with anything I did with him—”“You were being careful.”She would have hissed it, if it had containedany Ss.Harry raised a hand and rubbed at his messy hair, and somehow thatmade her want to scream at him even more. “Miss Granger,” said Harry,“I think this conversation has become metaphorical on a level that’s, um…”“What?” she screeched at him, at the top of her lungs inside their Quieting barrier.Then she realized and got so red that if she’d had an adult level of magical power her hair would have spontaneously caught on fire.The lone other patron in the library, the Ravenclaw boy sitting in thefar opposite corner, was staring wide-eyed at both of them while makinga rather sad attempt to conceal it by holding up a book just below his face.“Right,” Harry said with a small sigh. “So, keeping firmly in mind thatit was just a bad metaphor, and that real scientists collaborate with eachother all the time, I don’t think that I was cheating. Scientists often keepquiet about projects they’re working on. You and I are doing research thatwe’re keeping secret, and there were reasons not to tell Draco Malfoy inparticular—he wouldn’t have stayed around me at all, in the beginning,if he’d known I was your friend and not your rival. And Draco would’vebeen the one at risk if I’d told anyone else about him—”“Is that really all?” she said. “Really, Harry? You didn’t want both ofus to feel special, like we were the only ones you wanted to be with and theonly ones who got to be with you?”“That was not why I—”Harry paused.Harry looked at her.All the blood was rushing back into her face, there probably should’vebeen steam coming out of her ears, which in turn should’ve been melting off her head with the liquid flesh running down into her neck, as sherealized what she’d just blurted out.Harry was staring at her in dawning and complete terror.“Well…” she said in a rather high-pitched voice, “it’s… oh, I don’t know,Harry! Is it just a metaphor? When a boy spends a hundred thousandGalleons to save a girl from certain doom, she’s entitled to wonder, don’tyou think? It’s like being bought flowers, only, you see, rather more so—”Harry shoved himself up from the table and took a staggering stepback, even as he brought up his arms to wave frantically. “That’s not why Idid it! I did it because we’re friends!”“Just friends?”Harry Potter’s breathing was starting to scale up toward hyperventilation. “Very good friends! Extra-special friends, even! Best friends forever, possibly! But not that kind of friends!”“Is it really that awful to think about?” she said with a catch in hervoice. “I mean—I’m not saying I’m in love with you, but—”“Oh, you’re not? Thank goodness.” Harry brought up the sleeve of hisrobe and wiped across his forehead. “Look, Hermione, please don’t misunderstand, I’m sure you’re a wonderful person—”She took a staggering step back.“—but—even with my dark side—”“Is that what this is about?” said Hermione. “But I—I wouldn’t—”“No, no, I mean, I have a mysterious dark side and probably otherweird magic stuff going on, you know I’m not a normal child, not really—”“It’s okay to not be normal,” she said, feeling increasingly desperateand confused. “I’m okay with it—”“But even with all that weird magical stuff letting me be more adult thanI should be, I haven’t gone through puberty yet and there’s no hormonesin my bloodstream and my brain is physically incapable of falling in lovewith anyone. So I’m not in love with you! I couldn’t possibly be in lovewith you! For all I know at this point, six months from now my brain isgoing to wake up and decide to fall in love with Professor Snape! Er, canI take it from this that you have been through puberty?”“Eep,” said Hermione in a high-pitched sound. She swayed where shestood, and a moment later Harry was rushing over to her side and helpinglower her to sit on the ground, bracing her body with firm hands.The fact was that she had staggered over to Professor McGonagall’s office back in December, not in total surprise because she’d done her read* 1467 *ing, but still rather queasily and it was with great relief that she’d learnedthat witches had Charms to deal with the inconveniences and what wasHarry even doing asking a poor innocent girl a question like that—“Look, I’m sorry,” Harry said frantically. “I really didn’t mean most ofthat the way it sounded! I’m sure that anyone taking the outside viewof the whole situation and offering betting odds on who I finally marriedwould assign a higher probability to you than anyone else I can think of—”Her intelligence, which had barely been starting to pull itself together,promptly exploded into sparks and flame.“—though not necessarily a probability higher than fifty percent, Imean, from the outside view there’s a lot of other possibilities, and whoI like before I hit puberty probably isn’t all that strongly diagnostic of whoI’ll be with seven years later—I don’t want to sound like I’m promisinganything—”Her throat was making some sort of high-pitched sounds and shewasn’t really listening to exactly what. All her universe had narrowed toHarry’s terrible, terrible voice.“—and besides I’ve been reading about evolutionary psychology, and,well, there are all these suggestions that one man and one woman living together happily ever afterward may be more the exception ratherthan the rule, and in hunter-gatherer tribes it was more often just staying together for two or three years to raise a child during its most vulnerable stages—and, I mean, considering how many people end up horribly unhappy in traditional marriages, it seems like it might be the sortof thing that needs some clever reworking—especially if we actually dosolve immortality—”Tano Wolfe, of fifth-year Ravenclaw, slowly stood up from his librarydesk, from which vantage point he’d just watched Granger flee the library, sobbing. He hadn’t been able to hear the argument, but it hadclearly been one of those.Slowly and with his knees trembling, Tano approached the Boy-WhoLived, who was staring in the direction of the library doors, still vibratingfrom the force of how they’d been slammed.Tano didn’t particularly want to do this, but Harry Potter had beenSorted into Ravenclaw. The Boy-Who-Lived was, technically, his fellowRavenclaw. And that meant there was a Code.The Boy-Who-Lived didn’t say anything as Tano approached him, buthis gaze wasn’t friendly.Tano swallowed, laid a hand on Harry Potter’s shoulder, and recited,his voice cracking only slightly, “Witches! Go figure, huh?”“Remove your hand before I cast it into the outer darkness.”The library doors slammed open again in the wake of another departure.April 16th, 1992.12:07pm.Lunchtime.Harry stomped over to the mostly-deserted Gryffindor table, determining at a glance that lunch today was breen and Roopo balls. The ambient conversation, Harry could likewise hear, was Quidditch-related; anauditory environment which rated somewhat worse than the sound ofrusty chainsaws, but better than what the Ravenclaw table was still blithering about Hermione. Gryffindor House, at least, had started out less sympathetic to Draco Malfoy and had more political incentive to wish thateveryone would just forget certain unfortunate facts; and if that wasn’tthe right reason for silence, it was at least silence. Dean and Seamus andLavender were all gone for the holidays, but at least that left…“What was all that ruckus at the Head Table?” Harry said to theWeasley-twin group-mind, as he began to serve himself his own plate.“It looked like it was just ending as I walked in.”“Our beloved, but clumsy Professor Trelawney—”“Seems to have gone and dropped an entire soup tureen on herself—”“Not to mention Mr. Hagrid.”A quick glance at the Head Table confirmed that the Divination Professor was waving her wand frantically as the half-Giant dabbed at hisclothes. Nobody else seemed to be paying much attention, even Professor McGonagall. Professor Flitwick was standing on his chair as usual,the Headmaster seemed to be absent again (he’d been gone most days of1471 *the holiday), Professors Sprout and Sinistra and Vector were eating intheir usual grouping, and—“You know,” Harry said, as he turned his head away to stare at theceiling illusion of a clear blue sky, “that still creeps me out sometimes.”“What does?” said Fred or George.The powerful and enigmatic Defense Professor was ‘resting’ orwhatever-the-heck-was-wrong-with-him, his hands making fumbling,hesitant grabs at a chicken-leg that seemed to be eluding him on theplate.“Eh, nothing,” said Harry. “I’m not quite used to Hogwarts, yet.”Harry continued to eat in moderate silence, as various Weasleys discussed some bizarre mind-affecting substance called Chudley Cannons.“What sort of deep mysterious thoughts are you thinking?” said ayoung-looking witch with short hair, sitting nearby. “I mean, just curious. I’m Brienne, by the way.” She was gazing at him with one of thoselooks which Harry had firmly decided to just ignore until he was older.“So,” Harry said, “you know those really simple Artificial Intelligenceprograms like ELIZA that are programmed to use words in syntactic English sentences only they don’t contain any understanding of what thewords mean?”“Of course,” the witch said. “I have a dozen of them in my trunk.”“Well, I’m pretty sure my understanding of girls is somewhere aroundthat level.”A sudden hush fell.It took a few seconds for Harry to realize that, no, the entire Great Hallwasn’t staring at him, and then Harry twisted his head around to look.The figure who’d just staggered into the Great Hall appeared to beMr. Filch, Hogwarts’s token hallway monitor; who, along with his predatory cat Mrs. Norris, constituted a low-level random encounter whomHarry often breezed past wearing his epic-level Deathly Hallow. (Harryhad once consulted the Weasley twins about pulling some sort of prankon this deserving target, whereupon Fred or George had quietly pointedout that Mr. Filch was never seen to use a wand, which was odd, really,considering how many spells would be useful in that position, and itmade you wonder why Dumbledore had given the man a position atHogwarts, and Harry had shut up.)Right now Mr. Filch’s brown clothing was disarrayed and soaked withsweat, his shoulders were visibly heaving as he breathed, and his everpresent cat was missing.“Troll—” gasped Mr. Filch. “In the dungeons—”Minerva McGonagall stood up from the Head Table so quickly that herchair fell to the ground behind her.“Argus!” she cried. “What happened to you?”Argus Filch staggered forward from the huge doors, his upper bodystreaked and dotted with small crimson dots as though someone hadspattered steak sauce over his face. “Troll—grey—twice as tall as me—it—it—” Argus Filch covered his face with his hands. “It ate Mrs. Norris—ate her all up, in just one bite—”Minerva felt a stab of dismay in her other self, she hadn’t liked theother cat very much but the two of them had still been felines.An uproar started from the Great Hall. Severus stood up from theHead Table, somehow doing so without drawing any visible attention tohimself, and strode out the huge doors without another word.Of course, Minerva thought, the third-floor corridor—this could be adistraction—She mentally consigned all such matters to Severus’s care, drew herwand, raised it high, and let out five sharp cracks of purple fire.There was stunned silence but for Argus’s broken sobs.“It seems we have a dangerous creature loose in Hogwarts,” she saidto the faculty at the Head Table. “I will ask you all to aid in searching thehalls.” Then she turned to the stunned and watching students, and raisedher voice. “Prefects—lead your houses back to the dormitories immediately!”Percy Weasley leaped up from the Gryffindor table. “Follow me!” hesaid in a high voice. “Stick together, first-years! No, not you—” but bythat time the other prefects were raising their own voices as a renewedbabble sprang up.Then a clear, cool voice spoke under the sudden rush of sound.“Deputy Headmistress.”She turned.The Defense Professor was calmly wiping off his hands on a napkinas he stood up from the Head Table. “With respect,” said the man of unknown identity, “you are not expert in battle tactics, madam. In this situation, it would be wiser to—”“I do apologize, Professor,” said Professor McGonagall, as she turnedtoward the great doors. Filius and Pomona had already risen to followher, with Rubeus Hagrid towering over all of them as the half-giant stoodup. She’d been through similar experiences too many times, at this point.“Sad experience has taught me that on occasions such as these, it is nota good time to take any advice the current Defense Professor may offer.Indeed, I think it wise that the two of us search for the troll together, sothat no suspicions may be cast upon you for any untoward events whichoccur during that time.”Without any hesitation, the Defense Professor swung smoothly onthe Gryffindor table and clapped his hands with a sound like a floor cracking through.“Michelle Morgan of House Gryffindor, second in command of Pinnini’s Army,” the Defense Professor said calmly into the resulting quiet.“Please advise your Head of House.”Michelle Morgan climbed up onto her bench and spoke, the tiny witchsounding far more confident than Minerva remembered her being at thestart of the year. “Students walking through the hallways would be spreadout and impossible to defend. All students are to remain in the Great Halland form a cluster in the center… not surrounded by tables, a troll wouldjump right over tables… with the perimeter defended by seventh-year students. From the armies only, no matter how good they are at duelling, sothey don’t get in each other’s lines of fire.” Michelle hesitated. “I’m sorry,Mr. Hagrid, but—it wouldn’t be safe for you, you should stay behind withthe students. And Professor Trelawney shouldn’t confront a troll on herown either,” Michelle sounded much less apologetic about this part, “butif she’s paired with Professor Quirrell the two of them together can forman additional trusted and effective battle unit. That concludes my analysis, Professor.”“Adequate, for being put on the spot,” the Defense Professor said.“Twenty Quirrell points to you. But you neglect the still simpler pointthat home does not mean safe, and a troll is strong enough to rip a portraitdoor off its hinges—”“Enough,” Minerva snapped. “Thank you, Miss Morgan.” She lookedto the watching tables. “Students, you will do as she said.” Turned back tothe Head Table. “Professor Trelawney, you will accompany the DefenseProfessor—”“Ah,” Sybill said falteringly. Beneath her overdone makeup and messof shawls, the woman looked rather pale. “I’m afraid—I’m not entirelywell today—indeed, I feel rather faint—”“You won’t have to fight the troll,” Minerva said sharply, her patiencetaxed as usual when dealing with the woman. “Just stay with the DefenseProfessor and do not let him out of your sight for an instant, you must beable to testify afterward that you were with him at all times.” She turnedto Rubeus. “Rubeus, I am leaving you in charge here. Keep them safe.”The huge man straightened at this, losing his glum look and noddingproudly to her.Then Minerva looked at the students, and raised her voice. “It shouldgo entirely without saying that anyone leaving the Great Hall for any reason, will be expelled. No excuses will be accepted. Am I understood?”The Weasley twins, with whom she’d been making direct eye contact,nodded respectfully.She turned without another word and marched off toward the halldoors with the other Professors behind her.On the far side of the room, unnoticed on the wall, a clock showed12:14pm.…and he still didn’t realize.Tick.As Harry stared with narrowed eyes at where the Professors had goneout, wondering what was actually going on and what it meant, as the students came together into a more defensible mass and wands flicked tolevitate the tables out of their way, Harry still didn’t realize.Tick.“Shouldn’t the Professors all have formed up into pairs?” said anolder Gryffindor student whose name Harry didn’t know. “I mean—it’dbe slower, but it’d be safer, I think—”Tick.Someone else replied to this, raising her voice, but Harry didn’t catchmuch of it, the gist was that mountain trolls were highly magic-resistantand incredibly strong and could regenerate but they were still noisy so ifyou heard them coming, it shouldn’t be that hard for a Hogwarts Professor to wrap them up in Vadim’s Unbreakable something something.Tick.And Harry still didn’t realize.Tick.The crowd noises were subdued, people were talking in low voices toeach other while they glanced around, listening for the sound of a crashing door or an angry roar.Tick.Some students were speculating in whispers about what the DefenseProfessor could possibly be trying to achieve by smuggling in a troll, andwhether he was angry that Professor McGonagall had caught on to hisattempted distraction, and what it was a distraction from.Tick.And the thought still didn’t come to Harry, not until after all thestudents had formed a mass of perhaps a hundred bodies patrolled byproudly grim-looking seventh-year-students with their wands all pointedoutward, and somebody suggested doing a headcount, and someone elsereplied sarcastically that this might have made sense on some other day,but right now practically everyone was gone for the spring holiday andnobody really knew how many students were supposed to be in the room,let alone if any were missing.Tick.That was when Harry wondered where Hermione was.Tick.Harry looked over at where the Ravenclaws had clustered, he didn’tsee Hermione but then everyone was packed tightly-enough togetherthat you wouldn’t expect to see smaller students through the crowd,amid the upper-years.Tick.Harry then looked over at the Hufflepuffs to see if he could spotNeville, and even though Neville was standing behind a much tallerstudent, Harry’s visual processing managed to spot him almost immediately. Hermione wasn’t with the Hufflepuffs either, not that Harry couldsee—and she certainly wouldn’t be with the Slytherins—Tick.Harry pushed his way through the packed crowd, stepping beside oraround older students and in one case just ducking between their legs,until he was standing among the Ravenclaws and could definitely verifythat, nope, no Hermione.Tick.“Hermione Granger!” Harry said loudly. “Are you here?”Nobody answered.Tick.Somewhere in the back of his mind was a rising sense of horror, asother parts of him tried to decide exactly how much to panic. The firstDefense class of the year was rather fuzzy in Harry’s mind, but he distantly remembered something about trolls being able to track prey thatwas alone and undefended.Tick.Another track of thought searched frantically through inchoate possibilities, what could he do exactly? It wasn’t 3pm yet so he couldn’t reachthis now using his Time-Turner. Even if he could sneak out of the room—there had to be some way to put on his Cloak without being noticed, somesort of distraction he could use—he had no idea where Hermione was, andHogwarts was huge.Tick.Another part of his mind tried to model possibilities. From what thatother student had said, trolls weren’t silent predators, they were noisy—Hermione won’t have any idea it’s a troll, so she’ll go investigate the noise.She’s a heroine, isn’t she?—but Hermione now had an invisibility cloak and a broomstick in herpouch. Harry had insisted on that part for both her and Neville, and Professor McGonagall had told him it’d been done. That ought to be enoughto let Hermione get away, even if she was lousy on a broomstick. All shehad to do was get onto a section of roof, it was a clear day and sunlightwas supposed to be bad for trolls somehow, Harry remembered that partand therefore Hermione would remember it exactly. And surely, even ifHermione wanted to prove herself again, she couldn’t possibly be dumbenough to attack a mountain troll.Tick.She wouldn’t.Tick.That just wasn’t her.Tick.And then it occured to Harry that somebody had previously tried toframe Hermione Granger for murder using Memory Charms. Had doneso inside Hogwarts, without setting off any alarms. And had arrangedfor Draco to die slowly enough that it wouldn’t set off the wards until atleast six hours later when nobody could use a Time-Turner to check. Andthat whoever was clever enough to infiltrate a troll past the ancient wardsof Hogwarts without the Headmaster coming to investigate the strangecreature, could be clever enough to also take the obvious step of jinxingHermione’s magic items…Tick.There was a part of him that felt something like slowly rising panicas perspective shifted, a Necker Cube changing orientation, what the hellhad Harry been thinking, letting Hermione and Neville be kept insideHogwarts just because of them being given a few stupid trinkets, thatwasn’t going to stop anyone who wanted to kill them.Tick.Another part of his mind put up resistance, that possibility wasn’t certain, it was complex and the probability could easily be under 50%. It waseasy to imagine going into a huge panic in front of everyone and thenHermione getting back from the washrooms outside the Great Hall. Orif the troll ended up not going anywhere near her… like in the story of theboy who cried wolf, nobody would believe him the next time if she reallywas in trouble; it could use up reputational credit that he would later needfor something else…Tick.Harry recognized an instance of the fear-of-embarrassment schemathat stopped most people from ever doing anything under conditions ofuncertainty, and squashed it down hard. Even then it was strange howmuch willpower it took to muster the decision to shout out loud in frontof everyone, if he just hadn’t seen Hermione in the crowd it was going tobe embarrassing…Tick.Harry drew in a deep breath and shouted as loudly as he could, “Hermione Granger! Are you here?”The students all turned to look at him. Then some of them turnedaround to look around themselves. The noise around the room wentdown in volume as some conversations stilled.“Has anyone seen Hermione Granger since— since around ten-thirty today or so? Does anyone have any idea where she might be?”The background babble stilled further.Nobody raised their voice to shout anything at him, in particular not,Don’t worry, Harry, I’m right here.“Oh, Merlin,” somebody said from nearby, and then the backgroundbabble started up again, taking on a new and excited tone.Harry stared down at his hands, shutting out the yammering andtried to think, think, THINK—Tick.Tick.Tick.Susan Bones and a redheaded boy with a battered-looking wand bothshoved their way through the crowd to Harry at the same time.“We’ve got to let the Professors know somehow—”“We’ve got to go find her—”“Find her?” Susan snapped, rounding on the other boy. “How’ll we dothat, Captain Weasley?”“We’ll go off and look for her!” Ron Weasley snapped back.“Are you nuts? There’s already Professors searching the hallways,what makes you think we’ve got any better chance than them of runningacross General Granger? Only we’ll get eaten by the troll! And thenexpelled!”It was odd, how sometimes hearing bad ideas made the right idea obvious by contrast.“All right everyone! Listen up!”People turned to look.Harry’s throat ached after that, but he had everyone’s attention.“I have a broomstick,” Harry said as loudly as he could manage withhis throat still hurting. He’d remembered Azkaban, and the broomstickwhich had only sat two, when he’d requested one that could carry three.“It’s a 3-seater. I need one seventh-year from the armies to come withme. We’re going to fly through the hallways as fast as possible lookingfor Hermione Granger, pick her up, and come back immediately. Who’swith me?”The Great Hall became entirely silent, then.Students glanced at each other uneasily. The younger students lookedexpectantly at the older students, while they in turn turned to look at thestudents who were guarding the perimeter. Most of those were staringstraight ahead, pointing their wands just in case the troll picked that moment to burst through a wall.No one moved.No one spoke.Harry Potter spoke again. “We’re not going to fight the troll. If we seeit we’ll just fly away and there’s no way it’ll be able to keep up with us ona broomstick. I’ll take responsibility for squaring it with the administration. Please.”People went on looking at other people.Harry stared at the silent crowd, the dozen seventh-years looking sternlyoutward, feeling the coldness coming over him. Somewhere in the backof his mind, Professor Quirrell was laughing scornfully and mocking theidea that ordinary fools would ever do something useful of their own will,without a wand pointed at their heads…Tick.The standard remedy for bystander apathy was to focus on a singleindividual. “All right,” Harry said, trying to keep the commanding voiceof the Boy-Who-Lived who didn’t doubt obedience. “Miss Morgan, comewith me, now. We’ve got no time to waste.”The witch he’d named turned from where she’d been staring steadilyout at the perimeter, her expression aghast for the one second before herface closed up.“The Deputy Headmistress ordered us all to stay here, Mr. Potter.”It took an effort for Harry to unclench his teeth. “Professor Quirrelldidn’t say that and neither did you. Professor McGonagall isn’t a tactician, she didn’t think to check if we had missing students and she thoughtit was a good idea to start marching students through the hallways. ButProfessor McGonagall understands after her mistakes are pointed out toher, you saw how she listened to you and Professor Quirrell, and I’m certain that she wouldn’t want us to just ignore the fact that Hermione Granger is out there, alone—”Tick.“I’d expect the Professor to say she’d not wish any more studentsroaming the halls. The Professor said if anyone left for any reason, they’d1481 *be expelled. Maybe you don’t need to worry because you’re the Boy-WhoLived, but the rest of us do!”Tick.Somewhere in the back of his mind, Professor Quirrell was just laughing at him. Expecting some normal person to act without perfect strategicclarity, without a clear focus of responsibility on them personally, whenthey had a good excuse to do nothing… “A student’s life is at stake,” Harrysaid in a level voice. “She could be fighting the troll right now. Out ofcuriosity, does that mean anything to you at all?”Tick.Miss Morgan’s face twisted. “You—you’re the Boy-Who-Lived! Justgo off by yourself and snap your fingers, if you want to help her!”Tick.Harry was hardly even aware of what he was saying. “That’s just cleverness and bluffing, I don’t have any power like that in real life, a younggirl needs your help now are you a Gryffindor or not?”“Why are you saying any of this to me?” cried Miss Morgan. “I wasn’tleft in charge here! Mr. Hagrid was!”There was an awkward pause that suffused the whole room.Harry spun to look up at the huge half-giant towering over the crowdof students, as all other heads also turned toward him as one.“Mr. Hagrid,” Harry said, trying to keep his voice commanding. “Youneed to authorize this expedition and you need to do it now.”Rubeus Hagrid looked conflicted, though that was hard to judge withhis vast head so surrounded by his unshorn beard and locks; only his eyeslooked alive, embedded in all that hair. “Eh…” said the half-giant. “I wastol’ to keep yeh all safe—”“Great, now can we also keep Hermione Granger safe? You know, thestudent framed for a murder she did not commit who needs someone to helpher?”The half-giant startled as Harry spoke the words.Harry stared at the enormous man, desperately willing him to pickup on the hint, hoping the words hadn’t given it away to anyone else—hecouldn’t be just muscle, surely James and Lily had been friends with thisman out of more than pity—“Framed?” called out an anonymous voice, from somewhere over nearwhere the Slytherins gathered. “Ha, are you still on that? It’d serve herright if she did get eaten.”There was some laughter, even as cries of indignation came from elsewhere.The half-giant’s face firmed up. “Yeh stay here, lad,” Mr. Hagrid saidin a booming tone that was probably meant to be gentle. “I’ll go and lookfer her meself. Truth is, trolls can be a mite tricky—yeh’ve got to catch ’emby an ankle and dangle ’em just right, or they’ll rip yeh clean in half—”“Can you ride a broomstick, Mr. Hagrid?”“Eh—” Rubeus Hagrid frowned. “No.”“Then you can’t search fast enough. Sixth-years! Calling all sixth-years!Are there any sixth-years here who aren’t worthless cowards?”Silence.“Fifth years? Mr. Hagrid, tell them they’re authorized to go with meand keep me safe! I’m trying to be sensible, damn it!”The half-giant wrung his hands with an agonized expression. “Eh—Something snapped inside Harry and he started to stride directly toward the doors to the Great Hall, pushing aside anyone who didn’t get outof his way as though they were doughy statues. (He didn’t run, becauserunning was an invitation for somebody to stop you.) Somewhere in hismind he was moving through an empty room filled with mechanical puppets by whose meaningless lip-moving noises he’d been distracted—A huge figure interposed itself in his way.Harry looked up.“I can’t let yeh do that, Harry Potter, not yeh of all people. There’sstrange things afoot in this castle, and someone might be after MissGranger—or they might be after yeh.” Rubeus Hagrid’s voice was regretful but firm, and his gigantic hands lay at his side like forklifts. “I can’tlet yeh go out there, Harry Potter.”“Stupefy!”The red bolt crashed into the side of Hagrid’s head and made the hugeman startle. His head snapped around faster than anything that largeshould’ve moved, and bellowed, “What do yeh think yeh’re doing!” at theyoung form of Susan Bones.“Sorry!” she screamed. “Incendium! Glisseo!”The huge man’s hands, now slapping at the fire in his beard, didn’tquite manage to catch himself as he crashed to the floor, but it didn’t matter by then because Harry was past him and—Neville Longbottom stepped in front of him, looking desperate butdetermined, the Hufflepuff boy’s wand already level in his hand.Harry’s hand went for his wand in a sheer reflex action, he barely managed to check himself before Neville could fire on him, staring at his Lieutenant as though the world had gone mad.“Harry!” Neville burst out. “Harry, Mr. Hagrid’s right, you can’t, thiscould all be a trap, they could be after you—”All of Neville’s muscles went rigid and he toppled to the ground, stiffas a board.A pale-looking Ron Weasley stepped out from behind Neville, his ownwand level, and said, “Go.”“Ron, you madman, what are you doing—” came a voice distantly identifiable as Miss Clearwater’s boyfriend, but Harry was already dashing forthe door without looking back, even as Ron’s voice and Susan’s voice roseagain in incantation. There was a huge indignant bellow, and unknownvoices began to yell.Then Harry was through, his hand reaching into his pouch and hisvoice was saying “broomstick”, as behind him the great doors began toswing shut again.Harry continued running through the Entrance Hall even as the longthree-person broomstick and its sets of stirrups began to protrude fromthe pouch, repeating a number of swearwords in his head and thinkingthis is what happens when you try to be sensible with the part of his mind thatwasn’t trying to figure out a search pattern to cover places where Hermione might be. The Library was on the third floor and practically on theother side of the castle… Harry had almost reached the great marble staircase by the time the broomstick was in his hand and “Up!” he was in theair and accelerating up toward the second floor—“Gah!” Harry screamed, and barely managed to spin his broom in theair so that he didn’t impale one of the human figures lurking at the topof the stairs. There was a ghastly moment of trying not to fall off thebroom, perform the twists that would keep him in the stirrups, despitebeing really close to the ground and having almost no room to maneuverand then—“Fred? George?”“We can’t figure out how to find her!” one of the Weasley twinsblurted, hands twisting in distress. “We snuck out because we thoughtwe could find Miss Granger—there has to be a quick way to find anyoneinside the Hogwarts castle, we’re both sure of it—but we can’t figure outwhat it is!”Harry stared at both of them, from where he was hanging upsidedown from the broomstick where his desperate maneuver had broughthim, and entirely by reflex his mouth said, “Well, why were you so sureyou could find her?”“We don’t know!” cried the other Weasley twin.“Have you been able to find people inside Hogwarts before?”“Yes! We—” and the Weasley twin who was speaking stoppedabruptly, both redheads staring off into the distance with a blank expression.There was a thundering crash, as of two huge doors being shovedopen by someone very, very strong.Harry spun around in the air to present the two open stirruppositions on the broomstick to the Weasley twins, he didn’t say anything, there was no reason for them to give away their positions if theydidn’t have to. Time seemed to move too slowly as the Weasley twinsscrambled into the stirrups, Harry’s heart beating hard despite his mental calculation that Mr. Hagrid, running, shouldn’t reach even the foot ofthe stairway in time. Then the three of them were accelerating hard andaway toward the nearest corridor, the stone floor beneath them blurringand the walls seeming to make an audible whooshing sound (though thatwas just the wind in their ears) as they went past; Harry rememberedthat he was riding a longer three-person broomstick barely in time toslow down for the next turn.And now all the broomstick seats were occupied, but if they actuallyfound Hermione then—Harry could put on the Cloak of Invisibility,that should hide him from the troll, and that would free up a seat forHermione—Harry ducked hard before a sudden archway took his head off.“We found Jesse!” the Weasley twin seated behind Harry blurted. “Iknow we did! That time we needed to tell him that Filch was hunting forhim!”“How?” Harry said, most of his brain engaged in not dying in a horrible air accident. He should have slowed down for safety, but there wasa tension rising in him, a sourceless dread. He couldn’t slow down, something terrible would happen if he slowed down…“We—” said the Weasley twin seated lower down. “We can’t remember!”Another sharp turn taken at, Harry estimated, roughly 0.3% of thespeed of light, and they were going through a twisty curving corridor thatHarry always took to get from the Great Hall to the library only it wasn’tthe shortest way if you were on a broomstick, he should’ve taken the longstraight West Corridor instead—The part of his brain that wasn’t steering caught up with reality.“Someone’s been tampering with your minds!” Harry yelled, as heweaved through the curving corridor so fast that the tail-end Weasleysometimes lightly smacked into the wall as the length of the broomstickconflicted with Harry’s maladapted air skills.“What?” cried Fred or George.“Whoever got to Hermione messed with your minds too!” It could bean Obliviation, it could be a False Memory that hadn’t been planted right,but right now Harry couldn’t think—The broomstick turned and shot upward beside a spiral staircase, allthree of them flattened themselves against the broomstick so they couldmake in through the gap in the ceiling that opened onto the third floor,and then they were in front of the library, the broomstick slowing to ahalt with a shriek despite the lack of anything it could be friction-brakingagainst. Harry shot the Weasley twins a quick glance to stay put, as heclambered off the broomstick to shove open the doors of the library, controlling his breathing as he shoved his head inside.Hermione Granger wasn’t there.Madam Pince, who was eating a sandwich at her desk, looked up witha sudden glare. “Library’s closed!”“Have you seen Hermione Granger?” Harry said.“I said the library’s closed, boy! Lunch hours!”“This is extremely important. Have you seen Hermione Granger ordo you have any idea where she might be?”“No, now be off!”“Do you have any fast way of contacting Professor McGonagall in anemergency?”“Eh?” said the librarian, startled. She rose up from behind her desk.“What is—”“Yes or no. Please answer immediately.”“Ah—there’s the Floo—”“She’s not in her office,” Harry said. “Do you have any other way ofreaching her. Yes or no.”“Young man, I insist that you—”Harry’s brain flagged this as I’m talking to NPCs again and he spun onhis heel and dashed back for the broomstick.“Stop!” cried Madam Pince, bursting too late from the doors as Harryand the Weasley twins shot off again, out of the librarian’s sight. The pressure in Harry’s mind still rising, like a physical hand squeezing his chest,he had to find Hermione and he had no other notion of where she couldbe, unless it was the witches’ dorms in the Ravenclaw tower and that hecouldn’t enter. Searching all of Hogwarts bordered on a mathematicalimpossibility, there probably was no continuous flight path that enteredall the rooms at least once—why hadn’t he thought to demand for Hermione and Neville and him to be given a set of those neat little mirrors theAurors used to communicate—The realization that he was being stupid hit Harry like a blow to thestomach. He didn’t need mirrors to send a message, he hadn’t neededmirrors since January. Harry slowed the broomstick to a halt in midairof a hallway, his wand already coming into his hand, the driving will toprotect Hermione Granger rising to the front of his mind like a sun of silverfire and flowing down his arm as he criedand the blazing white humanoid burst into existence like a nova, theWeasley twins’ voices crying aloud in shock.“Tell Hermione Granger—that there’s a troll loose in Hogwarts—itcould be hunting for her—she needs to get into direct sunlight, now!”The silver figure turned as though it was departing, and then vanished.“Merlin’s underpants,” breathed Fred or George.The silver outline blasted back into the world, and said in the strangeoutside version of Harry’s own voice, “Hermione Granger says,” the blazing figure’s voice became higher-pitched, “AHHHHHHHHH!”Time seemed to fracture, like everything was moving very quickly andslowly at the same time. A desperate impulse to accelerate the broomstick, fly at its maximum speed, only Harry didn’t know where—“If you know where she is,” Harry shouted to the blazing humanoidfigure, staring into it as though it were a sun, “then take me to her!”The silver blaze moved and Harry accelerated after it, the Weasleytwins giving out high-pitched shrieks behind him as he fired through theair like a cannonball, moving faster than sanity, he didn’t focus on thewalls whizzing past him or how fast he was moving, just followed the silver light through corridors and flying up staircases and blitzing throughdoors that Fred or George cried desperate incantations to open and it wasall still taking too much time, somewhere deep inside Harry felt like he wassinking through molasses as windows and portraits shot past.The broomstick screamed through a final turn that whacked one ofthe Weasley twins against the wall not quite as hard as a Bludger wouldhit, and then they followed the brilliant Patronus through an open spacein the ceilings, blasting up and upwards, rising past one floor and thenanother in less than a breath.His Patronus slowed to a halt (Harry braking hard in response) justas they reached the level of a wide-open floor space that that spread outuntil it escaped the ceiling and turned into an outdoor terrace, a spreadof tiled marble open to the air and sky—clung to the floor in small masses, surrounding a blazingCoolpoolbluethatfiresseemedto burn with a deadlier, hotter blue.In one narrow circle the marble tiles were scorched and shattered bysome explosive spell that only the most prodigious of first-year witchescould have cast, with the last of her strength.On the terrace, still moving beneath the open sunlight, stood a greatlumpy creature of dull granite-grey. Body like a boulder with small baldhead perched on top like a stone, short legs thick as tree trunks with flat,horny feet. One hand held a tremendous stone club as long and as wideas an adult human, and the other hand heldThe Weasley twins screamed.Harry’s Patronus shattered.The troll snorted and spun around to face them, droppinginto the red pool that had spread out beneath its feet, raising its club high.Then a Weasley cried an incantation and the club was torn from thetroll’s hand, smashed into its face so hard it drove the troll back for oneof its steps, a blow that might have killed a Muggle. The troll gave a bellow of anger, its nose squashed and blood-spattered, and then the nosestraightened once more, regenerated. The troll grabbed with both handsfor the club, which shot away through the air but only barely dodged thegrab.“Lead it away, keep it off me,” said a voice.The levitated club moved backwards from the troll, from the terraceonto the wide-open floor beneath the ceiling; and the troll made a greatprodigious leap that almost brought the club into its hands. Then the trollmade another great leap as the club moved to one side; and the broomstick moved forwards and Harry jumped off and ran towards where Hermione Granger was lying in a pool of her own blood with her legs eatenaway to the upper thighs.Harry’s hands tore open the healer’s kit from his pouch, grabbed oneof the self-tightening tourniquets, wrapped them around one raggedtooth-marked stump, his hands briefly slipping in the blood, they didn’ttremble, there wasn’t any allowance for his hands to tremble. As thetourniquet formed a complete loop it tightened hard and more bloodcame out, but then the bleeding stopped on that thigh-stump, andHarry turned to the other. Part of his mind was screaming, screaming,screaming and even the part of him picking up the other self-tighteningtourniquet heard it, but that also wasn’t allowed.The two Weasley twins were shouting spells, one after another inrapid-fire casting that would have had Harry unconscious in sixty seconds, sometimes the twins shouted two spells simultaneously in perfectcoordination, but most of the spells were disrupting in harmless showersof sparks against the troll’s skin. As the other tourniquet tightened itselfin another pulse of blood, Harry looked up at a “Diffindo!” / “Reducto!”that made the troll’s vulnerable eyes explode in twin showers of vitreoushumor, but the troll only bellowed once more, its eyes already reforming.“Fire and acid!” Harry shouted. “Use fire or acid!”“Fuego!” / “Incendio!”Harry heard, but he wasn’t looking, he was reaching for the syringe of glowing orange liquid that was the oxygenatingpotion, pushing it into Hermione’s neck at what Harry hoped was thecarotid artery, to keep her brain alive even if her lungs or heart stopped,so long as her brain stayed intact everything else could be fixed, it had tobe possible for magic to fix it, it had to be possible for magic to fix it, ithad to be possible for magic to fix it, and Harry pushed the plunger of thesyringe all the way down, creating a faint glow beneath the pale skin ofher neck. Harry then pushed down on her chest, where her heart shouldbe, hard compressions that he hoped was moving the oxygenated bloodaround to where it could reach her brain, even if her heart might havestopped beating, he hadn’t actually thought to check her pulse.Then Harry stared at the other things in his medical kit, his mind go* 1490 *ing blank as he tried to figure out what else of what was there, if anything,he could use. The screaming in that distant corner of his mind was getting louder, much louder, now that his hands had stopped their franticmotions. He was suddenly aware of the liquid sensation where blood hadsoaked through his robes and the knees of his pants.From behind Harry came the sound of another bellow from the troll,and he heard one of the Weasley twins shout “Deligitor prodeas!” and then,“HELP! Do something!”Harry twisted his head back to look, and saw that one of the Weasleytwins was somehow now wearing the Sorting Hat on his head, facing offagainst the troll which held the huge stone club in both its hands, lookingsomewhat scorched now and with one or two smoking scars across itsarms, but still intact.And then the voice of the Hat bellowed in a voice so loud it seemed toshake the walls,A pulse of power burned the air, magic feeling almost tangible evento Harry’s young senses, the troll jumped back a pace with a snort of surprise. Fred or George, with a strange look on his face, swept the Hat offhis head with a motion smooth as a magician’s trick, and reached in withone hand and drew forth a hilt whose pommel was a glowing ruby, followed by a wide crossguard of gleaming white metal, and a blade as longas a tall child. As the sword was revealed the air seemed to fill with a silentscream of fury.Upon the blade was written in golden script, nihil supernum.Then the Weasley twin raised the sword aloft as though the huge bladeweighed nothing, and screamed and charged.Harry’s lips opened to say something, some long sentence like, No,stop, you have no idea how to use a sword but not even a single syllable lefthis lips before the sword sliced off the troll’s right arm through the elbow, cutting through skin and flesh and bone like jelly; just as the alreadyswinging arc of the stone club smashed into the charging Weasley twinand sent him flying through the air above the marble floor, over the gapout of which they’d risen on the broomstick, until that Weasley hit thewall on the opposite side and then collapsed into an unmoving heap.1491 *The bright sword vanished down into the opening in the floor, clattering distantly as it dropped.“Fred!” screamed George Weasley, and then “VENTUS!”An invisible blow caught the troll and hurled it sideways through theair.The troll was hit again, blown to the edge of the floor and the gap leading downwards.But the troll had reached down and grabbed at the floor, its remaininghand crunching through marble to gain a firm hold. The third blow sentthe troll’s body over the gap; but the hand remained at the edge. And thenthe troll was pulling itself back up single-handedly, roaring.George Weasley staggered, almost falling, his hand dropping to hisside. “Harry—” the Weasley twin said in a strained voice, “Run—”The remaining Weasley twin took a step sideways, slumped againstthe wall, and slid to the ground.Time was fractured in Harry’s mind, the world around him seemedto move slowly, distorted, or perhaps it was his own mind twisting andfolding. He should have been moving, doing something, but a strangeparalysis seemed to be stopping all his muscles, all his motions. Without any time for words, thoughts came in flashes of concepts: that ifHarry ran away the troll would eat the Weasley twins as well as Hermione,that if Bludgers didn’t kill wizards then Fred should still be alive, that theWeasley twins were more powerful spellcasters than him and they hadn’tbeen able to hold back the troll, there was no time to Transfigure anything he didn’t already possess, the troll seemed too agile to be lured overthe edge of the terrace to fall off the sides of the Hogwarts castle, someone had enchanted the troll against sunlight before using it as a murderweapon and might also have strengthened it in other ways. And then amental image of Hermione running from the troll, running for sunlight,finally reaching the bright terrace with the troll hot on her heels, only tofind that someone else had thought of that possibility, too.The screaming horror in his mind was drowned out by another emotion.Harry stood up.On the other side of the room, the enemy had also risen, the unregenerating stump of one sword-cut arm still bloody.intent to killThe troll grasped its fallen club in its remaining hand, and gave a hugebellow, smashing the club into the floor and sending marble chips flying.think purely of killingThe troll began to lumber towards where George had fallen, a thinstring of drool trailing from the side of its lips.grasp at any means to do soHarry took five strides forward, and the enemy gave another bellowand turned away from George, its eyes focusing squarely on him.censors off, do not flinchThe third most perfect killing machine in nature bounded towardshim in leaping steps.Harry’s left hand already held the Transfigured diamond from hisring, his right hand already held his wand.“Wingardium Leviosa.”Harry’s wand directed the tiny jewel into the troll’s mouth.“Finite Incantatem.”The troll’s head blew off its spine as the rock expanded back into itsold form, and Harry stepped aside as the Enemy’s body crashed wherehe’d been standing.The enemy’s head was already beginning to regenerate, the raggedstump of the jaw and spine smoothing over, the mouth completing itselfand replacing its teeth.Harry bent down and picked up the troll’s head by its left ear. Hiswand jammed through the troll’s left eye, plunging through the jelly-likematerial and passing through the wide socket in the bone. Harry visualized a one-millimeter-wide cross-section through the enemy’s brain, andTransfigured it into sulfuric acid.The enemy stopped regenerating.Harry threw the corpse over the edge of the terrace and turned backto Hermione.Her eyes were moving, and focused on him.Harry scrambled down beside her, ignoring the blood soaking moreof his already-soaked robes. You’ll be all right, his brain formed the sentence, but his lips wouldn’t move. You’ll be all right, we’ll find some magic tofix all this, put you back to normal, just hold on, don’t—Hermione’s lips were moving, just a tiny bit but they were moving.“your… fault…”Time froze. Harry should have told her not to talk, to save her breath,only he couldn’t unblock his lips.Hermione drew in another breath, and her lips whispered, “Not yourfault.”Then she exhaled, and closed her eyes.Harry stared at her with his mouth half-open, his breath caught in histhroat.“Don’t do this,” said his voice. He’d only been two minutes late.Hermione suddenly convulsed, her arms twitching into the airas though reaching up for something, and her eyes flew open again.There was a burst of something that was magic and also more, a shoutlouder than an earthquake and containing a thousand books, a thousand libraries, all spoken in a single cry that was Hermione; too vast tobe understood, except that Harry suddenly knew that Hermione hadwhited out the pain, and was glad not to be dying alone. For a moment itseemed like the outpouring of magic might hold, take root in the castle’sstone; but then the outpouring ended and the magic faded, her bodystopped moving and all motion halted as Hermione Jean Granger ceasedto exist—No.Harry stood up from the body, swaying.No.There was a burst of flame and Dumbledore was standing there withFawkes, his eyes filled with horror. “I felt a student die! What—”The old wizard’s eyes saw what lay upon the ground.“Oh, no,” whispered Albus Dumbledore. Fawkes gave a sad, mournfulcroon.“Bring her back.”There was silence on the terrace. Fred Weasley had risen up into theair at a gesture from Dumbledore’s wand and was floating towards them,surrounded by a reassuring pink glow.“Harry—” the old wizard began. His voice cracked. “Harry—”“Have Fawkes cry on her or whatever. Hurry up.” The voice that spokesounded perfectly calm.“I, I can’t, Harry, it’s too late, she’s dead—”“I don’t want to hear about it. If it was me lying there, you’d pull somekind of amazing rabbit out of your hat and save me, right, because thehero isn’t allowed to die before the story’s over. Well, she’s the hero too,so whatever you were saving for that extra-special occasion, just go aheadand use it now. I promise I’ll pay you back.”“There isn’t anything I can do! Her soul has departed, she’s passed on!”Harry opened his mouth to scream out all his fury, and then closedit again. There wasn’t any point in screaming, it wouldn’t accomplishanything. The unbearable pressure rising inside him couldn’t be let outthat way.Harry turned away from Dumbledore and looked down at where theremains of Hermione Granger were lying in a pool of blood. Part of hismind was hammering at the world around him, trying to make it goaway, wake up from the nightmare and find himself back in his Ravenclaw dorm room with the morning sun shining through the curtains.But the blood remained and Harry didn’t wake up, and another part ofhim already knew that this event was real, part of the same flawed worldthat included Azkaban and the Wizengamot chamber andNoWith a fracturing feeling, as though time was still torn to piecesaround him, Harry turned away from Dumbledore and looked downat the remains of Hermione Granger lying in a pool of blood with twotourniquets tied around her thigh-stumps, and decidedNo.I do not accept this.There isn’t any reason to accept it, not when there’s magic in the world.Harry would learn whatever he had to learn, invent whatever he hadto invent, rip the knowledge of Salazar Slytherin from the Dark Lord’smind, discover the secret of Atlantis, open any gates or break any sealsnecessary, find his way to the root of all magic and reprogram it.He would rip apart the foundations of reality itself to get HermioneGranger back.“The crisis is over,” the Defense Professor said. “You may dismount,Madam.”Trelawney, who had been sitting behind him on the two-personbroomstick that had just blazed through Hogwarts burning directlythrough all the walls and floors in their way, hastily pulled herself off andthen sat down hard on the floor, a pace away from the red-glowing edgesof a newly made gap in the wall. The woman was still breathing in gasps,bending over herself as though she were on the verge of vomiting outsomething larger than she was.The Defense Professor had felt the boy’s horror, through the link thatexisted between the two of them, the resonance in their magic; and hehad realized that the boy had sought the troll and found it. The DefenseProfessor had tried to send an impulse to retreat, to don the Cloak of Invisibility and flee; but he’d never been able to influence the boy throughthe resonance, and hadn’t succeeded that time either.He’d felt the boy give himself over fully to the killing intention.That was when the Defense Professor had begun burning through thesubstance of Hogwarts, trying to reach the battle in time.He’d felt the boy exterminate his enemy in seconds.He’d felt the boy’s dismay as one of his friends died.He’d felt the fury the boy had directed at some annoyance who waslikely Dumbledore; followed by an unknown resolution whose unyielding hardness even he found adequate. With any luck, the boy had justdiscarded his foolish little reluctances.Unseen by anyone, the Defense Professor’s lips curved up in a thinsmile. Despite its little ups and downs, on the whole this had been a surprisingly good day—“He is here. The one who will tear apart the very stars inheaven. He is here. He is the end of the world.”simple Innervate from the Headmaster had awakened Fred Weasley,followed by a preliminary healing Charm for a broken arm andcracked ribs. Harry’s voice had distantly told the Headmaster aboutthe Transfigured acid inside the troll’s head (Dumbledore had lookeddown over the side of the terrace and made a gesture before returning)and then about the Weasley twins’ minds having been tampered with,carrying on a separate conversation that Harry remembered but couldnot process.Harry still stood over Hermione’s body, he hadn’t moved from thatspot, thinking as fast as he could through the sense of dissociation andfragmented time, was there anything he should be doing now, any opportunities that were passing irrevocably. Some way to reduce the amountof magical omnipotence that would be required later. A temporal beacon effect to mark this instant for later time travel, if he someday founda way to travel back further than six hours. There were theories of timetravel under General Relativity (which had seemed much less plausiblebefore Harry had run across Time-Turners) and those theories said youcouldn’t go back to before the time machine was built—a relativistic timemachine maintained a continuous pathway through time, it didn’t teleport anything. But Harry didn’t see anything helpful he could do usingspells in his lexicon, Dumbledore wasn’t being very cooperative, and inany case this was several minutes after the critical location within Time“Harry,” the Headmaster whispered, laying his hand on Harry’sshoulder. He had vanished from where he was standing over the Weasleytwins and come into existence beside Harry; George Weasley had discontinously teleported from where he was sitting to be kneeling next to hisbrother’s side, and Fred was now lying straight with his eyes open andwincing as he breathed. “Harry, you must go from this place.”“Hold on,” said Harry’s voice. “I’m trying to think if there’s anythingelse I can do.”The old wizard’s voice sounded helpless. “Harry—I know you do notbelieve in souls—but whether Hermione is watching you now, or no, I donot think she would wish for you to be like this.”…no, it was obvious.Harry leveled his wand at Hermione’s body—“Harry! What are you—”—and poured everything down his arm into his hand—“Frigideiro!”“—doing?”“Hypothermia,” Harry said distantly, as he staggered. It’d been oneof the spells he and Hermione had experimented on, a lifetime ago, so hewas able to control it precisely, though it had taken a lot of power to affectthat much mass. Hermione’s body should now be at almost exactly fivedegrees Celsius. “People have been revived from cold water after morethan thirty minutes without breathing. The cold protects you from braindamage, you see, it slows everything down. There’s a saying Muggle doctors have, you’re not dead until you’re warm and dead—I think they evencool down the patient during some surgeries, if they have to stop someone’s heart for a while.”Fred and George started sobbing.Dumbledore’s face was already streaked with tears. “I’m sorry,” hewhispered. “Harry, I’m so sorry, but you have to stop this.” The Headmaster took Harry by the shoulders and pulled on him.Harry allowed himself to be turned away from Hermione’s body,walked forward as the Headmaster pushed him away from the blood.The Cooling Charm would buy him time. Hours at least, maybe days ifhe could manage to keep casting the spell on Hermione or if they storedher body somewhere cold.Now there was time to think.Minerva had seen Albus’s face and she’d known something was wrong;there had been time for her to wonder what had happened, and even whohad died; her mind flashing to Alastor, to Augusta, to Arthur and Molly,all the most likely targets at the start of Voldemort’s second rise. She hadthought that she had steeled herself, she had thought herself ready for theworst.Then Albus spoke, and all the steel left her.Not Hermione—no—Albus gave her a brief space to weep; and then told her that Harry Potter, who had watched Miss Granger die, had seated himself outside theinfirmary storeroom where Miss Granger’s remains were being kept, refusing to move from the spot, and telling anyone who spoke to him to goaway so he could think.The only thing that had elicited any reaction from the boy was whenFawkes had tried to sing to him; Harry Potter had shrieked at the phoenixnot to do that, his feelings were real, he didn’t want magic trying to healthem like they were a disease. After that Fawkes had refused to singagain.Albus thought that she might have the best chance of reaching HarryPotter now.So she had to pull herself together, and clean up her face; there wouldbe time later for private grief, when her surviving children no longerneeded her.Minerva McGonagall pulled together the dislocated pieces of herself,wiped her eyes a final time, and laid her hand on the doorknob of the infirmary section whose back storeroom was now being used, for the secondtime this century and for the fifth time since the castle of Hogwarts hadbeen raised, as the resting place of a promising young student.She opened the door.Harry Potter’s eyes gazed at her. The boy was sitting on the floor infront of the door to the back storeroom, and holding his wand in his lap.If those eyes were grieving, if they were empty, if they were even broken,it couldn’t be seen from looking at the boy’s face. There were no dried1501 *tears on those cheeks.“Why are you here, Professor McGonagall?” Harry Potter said. “I toldthe Headmaster I’d like to be left alone for a while.”She couldn’t think of anything to say. To help you—you’re not all right—but she didn’t know what to say, there was nothing she could imaginesaying that would make things better. She hadn’t planned ahead beforeshe’d walked into the room, having not been at her best.“What are you thinking about?” Minerva said. It was the only sentence that came into her mind. Albus had told her that Harry had beensaying, over and over, that he was thinking; and she had to get Harry talking, somehow.Harry stared half at her and half past her, a tension coming into hisface, as she held her breath.It took a while before Harry spoke.“I’m trying to think if there’s anything I should be doing right now,”said Harry Potter. “It’s hard, though. My mind keeps on imagining waysthe past could have gone differently if I’d thought faster, and I can’t ruleout that there might be a key insight in there somewhere.”“Mr. Potter—” she said falteringly. “Harry, I don’t think it’s healthyfor you to be—thinking like that—”“I disagree. It’s not thinking that gets people killed.” The words werespoken in a level monotone, as though reciting lines from a book.“Harry,” she said, hardly even thinking as she said it, “there’s nothingyou could have done—”Something flickered in Harry’s expression. His eyes seemed to focuson her for the first time.“Nothing I could have done?” Harry’s voice rose on the last word.“Nothing I could have DONE? I’ve lost track of how many different ways Icould’ve saved her! If I’d asked to have us all given communications mirrors! IfI’d insisted on Hermione being taken out of Hogwarts and put in a school thatisn’t insane! If I’d snuck out immediately instead of trying to argue with normalpeople! If I’d remembered the Patronus earlier! If I’d thought through possibleemergencies and trained myself to think about Patronuses earlier! Even at thevery last minute it might not have been too late! I killed the troll and turned toher and she was still ALIVE and I just knelt next to her listening to her last wordslike an IDIOT instead of casting the Patronus again and calling Dumbledore tosend Fawkes! Or if I’d just approached the whole problem from a differentangle—if I’d looked for a student with a Time-Turner to send a messageback in time before I found out about anything happening to her, insteadof ending up with an outcome that can’t be altered—I asked the Headmaster to go back and save Hermione and then fake everything, fake thedead body, edit everyone’s memories, but Dumbledore said that he triedsomething like that once and it didn’t work and he lost another friendinstead. Or if I’d—if I’d only gone with—if, that night—”Harry pressed his hands over his face, and when he removed themagain, his face was calm and composed once more.“Anyway,” said Harry Potter, now in a monotone again, “I don’t wantto repeat that mistake, so I’m going to spend until dinnertime thinkingif there’s anything I should be doing. If I haven’t thought of anything bythen I’ll go to dinner and eat. Now please go away.”She was aware now that tears were sliding down her cheeks, again.“Harry—Harry, you have to believe that this isn’t your fault!”“Of course it’s my fault. There’s no one else here who could be responsible for anything.”“No! You-Know-Who killed Hermione!” She was hardly aware ofwhat she was saying, that she hadn’t screened the room against whomight be listening. “Not you! No matter what else you could’ve done, it’snot you who killed her, it was Voldemort! If you can’t believe that you’llgo mad, Harry!”“That’s not how responsibility works, Professor.” Harry’s voice waspatient, like he was explaining things to a child who was certain not to understand. He wasn’t looking at her anymore, just staring off at the wall toher right side. “When you do a fault analysis, there’s no point in assigningfault to a part of the system you can’t change afterward, it’s like steppingoff a cliff and blaming gravity. Gravity isn’t going to change next time.There’s no point in trying to allocate responsibility to people who aren’tgoing to alter their actions. Once you look at it from that perspective, yourealize that allocating blame never helps anything unless you blame yourself, because you’re the only one whose actions you can change by puttingblame there. That’s why Dumbledore has his room full of broken wands.He understands that part, at least.”Some distant part of her mind made a note to wait until much laterand then speak sharply to the Headmaster about what he was showingto impressionable young children. She might even scream at him thistime. She’d been thinking about screaming at him anyway, because ofMiss Granger—“You’re not responsible,” she said, though her voice trembled. “It’s theProfessors—it’s us who are responsible for student safety, not you.”Harry’s eyes flicked back to her. “You’re responsible?” There was atightness in the voice. “You want me to hold you responsible, ProfessorMcGonagall?”She raised her chin and nodded. It would be better, by far, than Harryblaming himself.The boy pushed himself up from where he was sitting on the floor, andtook a step forward. “All right, then,” Harry said in a monotone. “I tried todo the sensible thing, when I saw Hermione was missing and that noneof the Professors knew. I asked for a seventh-year student to go with meon a broomstick and protect me while we looked for Hermione. I askedfor help. I begged for help. And nobody helped me. Because you gaveeveryone an absolute order to stay in one place or they’d be expelled, noexcuses. No matter what else Dumbledore gets wrong, he at least thinksof his students as people, not animals that have to be herded into a penand kept from wandering out. You knew you weren’t any good at militarythinking, your first idea was to have us walking through the hallways, youknew some students there were better than you at strategy and tactics,and you still nailed us down in one room without any discretionary judgment. So when something you didn’t foresee happened and it would’vemade perfect sense to send out a seventh-year student on a fast broom tolook for Hermione Granger, the students knew you wouldn’t understandor forgive. They weren’t afraid of the troll, they were afraid of you. Thediscipline, the conformity, the cowardice that you instilled in them delayedme just long enough for Hermione to die. Not that I should’ve tried asking for help from normal people, of course, and I will change and be lessstupid next time. But if I were dumb enough to allocate responsibility tosomeone who isn’t me, that’s what I’d say.”Tears were streaming down her cheeks.“That’s what I’d tell you if I thought you could be responsible for anything. But normal people don’t choose on the basis of consequences, theyjust play roles. There’s a picture in your head of a stern disciplinarian andyou do whatever that picture would do, whether or not it makes any sense.A stern disciplinarian would order the students back to their rooms, evenif there was a troll roaming the hallways. A stern disciplinarian wouldorder students not to leave the Hall on pain of expulsion. And the littlepicture of Professor McGonagall that you have in your head can’t learnfrom experience or change herself, so there isn’t any point to this conversation. People like you aren’t responsible for anything, people like me are,and when we fail there’s no one else to blame.”The boy strode forward to stand directly before her. His hand dartedbeneath his robes, brought forth the golden sphere that was the Ministryissued protective shell of his Time Turner. He spoke in a dead, level voicewithout any emphasis. “This could’ve saved Hermione, if I’d been able touse it. But you thought it was your role to shut me down and get in myway. Nobody has died in Hogwarts in fifty years, you said that when youlocked it, do you remember? I should’ve asked again after Bellatrix Blackgot loose from Azkaban, or after Hermione got framed for attemptedmurder. But I forgot because I was stupid. Please unlock it now beforeany of my other friends die.”Unable to speak, she brought forth her wand and did so, releasing thetime-keyed enchantment she’d laced into the shell’s lock.Harry Potter flipped open the golden shell, looked at the tiny glasshourglass within its circles, nodded, and then snapped the case shut.“Thank you. Now go away.” The boy’s voice cracked again. “I have tothink.”She closed the door behind her, an awful and still mostly-muffled soundescaping her throat—Albus shimmered into existence beside her, taking on a brief garishhue as the Disillusionment wore off.She did not jump, quite. “I’ve told you, stop doing that,” Minerva said.Her voice sounded dull in her own ears. “That was private.”Albus flickered his fingers at the door behind her. “I was afraidMr. Potter might do you some harm.” The Headmaster paused, then saidquietly, “I am very surprised that you stood there and took that.”“All I had to do was say ‘Mr. Potter’, and he would have stopped.” Hervoice had dropped almost to a whisper. “Just that, and he would havestopped. And then he would have had no one to say those awful things to,no one at all.”“I thought Mr. Potter’s remarks were entirely unfair and undeserved,”Albus said.“If it had been you, Albus, you would not have threatened to expel anyone leaving the room. Can you honestly tell me otherwise?”Albus’s brows rose. “Your role in this disaster was tiny, your decisionsquite sensible at the time, and it is only Harry Potter’s perfect hindsightthat lets him imagine otherwise. Surely you are wiser than to blame yourself for this, Minerva.”She knew perfectly well that Albus would be placing a picture of Hermione in that awful room of his, that it would occupy a place of honor.Albus would hold himself responsible, she was certain, even though hehadn’t even been in Hogwarts at the time. But not her.So you also don’t think it’s worth the trouble of holding me responsible…She slumped against the nearest wall, trying not to let the tearsemerge again; she’d never seen Albus weep save thrice. “You have alwaysbelieved in your students, as I never have. They would not have beenafraid of you. They would have known you would understand.”“Minerva—”“I am not fit to succeed you as Headmistress. We both know it.”“You are wrong,” Albus said quietly. “When the time comes, you willbe the forty-fifth Headmistress of Hogwarts and you will do an excellentjob of it.”She shook her head. “What now, Albus? If he will not listen to me,then who?”It was perhaps half an hour later. The boy still guarded the door to wherehis best friend’s body lay, sitting his vigil. He was staring downward, athis wand as it lay in his hands. Sometimes his face screwed up in thought,at other times it relaxed.Although the door did not open, and there was no sound, the boylooked up. He composed his face. His voice, when he spoke, was dull.“I don’t want company.”The door opened.The Defense Professor of Hogwarts entered into the room and shutthe door behind him, taking up careful position in a corner between twowalls, as far away from the boy as the room permitted. A sharp sense ofcatastrophe had risen in the air between the two of them, and hung thereunchanging.“Why are you here?” said the boy.The man tilted his head slightly. Pale eyes examined the boy as thoughhe were a specimen of life from a distant planet, and correspondinglydangerous.“I’ve come to apologize, Mr. Potter,” the man said quietly.“Apologize for what?” the boy said. “Why, what could you have doneto prevent Hermione’s death?”“I should have thought to check for the presence of yourself, Mr. Longbottom, and Miss Granger, all of whom were obvious next targets,” theDefense Professor said without hesitation. “Mr. Hagrid was not mentallyequipped to command the student contingent. I should have ignored theDeputy Headmistress’s request for silence, and told her to leave behindProfessor Flitwick, who would have been better able to defend the students from any threat, and who could have maintained communicationvia Patronus.”“Correct.” The boy’s voice was razor-sharp. “I’d forgotten there wassomeone else in Hogwarts who could be responsible for things. So whydidn’t you think of it, Professor? Because I don’t believe that you werestupid.”There was a pause, and the boy’s fingers whitened on his wand.“You did not think of it either, Mr. Potter, at the time.” There was aweariness in the Defense Professor’s voice. “I am smarter than you. Ithink faster than you. I am more experienced than you. But the gap between the two of us is not the same as the gap between us and them. Ifyou can miss something, then so can I.” The man’s lips twisted. “You see, Ideduced at once that the troll was but a distraction from some other matter, and of no great importance in itself. So long as nobody sent the students wandering pointlessly through the halls, or uncaringly dispatchedthe young Slytherins to those very dungeons where the troll had beenspotted.”The boy did not seem to relax. “I suppose that is plausible.”“In any case,” said the man, “if there is anyone who can be said to beresponsible for Miss Granger’s death, it is myself, not you. It is I, not you,who should have—”“I perceive that you have spoken to Professor McGonagall and thatshe has given you a script to follow.” The boy did not bother keeping thebitterness from his voice. “If you have something to say to me, Professor,say it without the masks.”There was a pause.“As you wish,” the Defense Professor said emotionlessly. The pale eyesstayed keen and sharp. “I do regret that the girl is dead. She was a goodstudent in my Defense class, and could have been an ally to you later. Iwould wish to console you for your loss, but I cannot see how to go aboutdoing so. Naturally, if I find the ones responsible I shall kill them. Youare welcome to join in should circumstances permit.”“How touching,” the boy said, his voice cool. “You are not claiming tohave liked Hermione, then?”“Her charms were lost on me, I suspect. I no longer form such bondseasily.”The boy nodded. “Thank you for being honest. Is that all, Professor?”There was a pause.“The castle is scarred, now,” said the man standing in the corner.“What?”“When a certain ancient device in my possession informed me thatMiss Granger was on the verge of death, I cast that spell of cursed fire ofwhich I once spoke. I burned through some walls and floors so that mybroomstick could take a more direct path.” The man still spoke tonelessly.“Hogwarts will not heal such wounds easily, if at all. I suppose it will benecessary to patch over the holes with lesser conjurations. I regret thatnow, since I was in any case too late.”“Ah,” said the boy. He closed his eyes briefly. “You did want to saveher. You wanted it so strongly that you made some sort of actual effort. Isuppose your mind, if not theirs, would be capable of that.”A brief, dry smile from the man.“Thank you for that, Professor. But I would like to be left alone nowuntil dinnertime. You of all people will understand. Is that all?”“Not quite,” the man said. A tinge of sardonic dryness now returnedto his voice. “You see, based on recent experiences, I am concerned thatyou may now intend to do something extremely foolish.”“Such as what?” said the boy.“I am not quite sure. Perhaps you have decided that a universe without Miss Granger is devoid of value, and should be destroyed for the insults it has dealt you.”The boy smiled without any humor. “Your own issues are showing,Professor. I don’t really go in for that sort of thing. Did you, at somepoint?”“Not particularly. I have no great fondness for the universe, but I dolive there.”There was a pause.“What are you planning, Mr. Potter?” said the man in the corner. “Youhave come to some significant resolution, though you are trying to hideit from me. What do you now intend?”The boy shook his head. “I’m still thinking, and would like to be leftalone to do it.”“I recall an offer you once made to me, some months ago,” said theDefense Professor. “Do you want someone intelligent to talk to? I willunderstand if you are not pleasant to be around.”The boy shook his head again. “No, thank you.”“Well, then,” said the Defense Professor. “What about someone whois powerful and not particularly bound by naive scruples?”There was a hesitation, and then the boy once more shook his head.“Someone who is knowledgeable of much secret lore, and magics thatsome might consider to be unnatural?”There was a slight narrowing of the boy’s eyes, so imperceptible thatsomeone else might not have—“I see,” said the Defense Professor. “Go ahead and ask me about it,then. I give you my word that I will repeat nothing of it to the others.”The boy took a while to speak, and when he did it was in a crackedvoice.“I mean to bring Hermione back. Because there isn’t an afterlife, andI’m not about to just let her—just not be—”The boy pressed his hands over his face, and when he withdrew them,he once more seemed as dispassionate as the man standing in the corner.The Defense Professor’s eyes were abstract, and faintly puzzled.“How?” the man said finally.“However I have to.”There was another pause.“Regardless of the risks,” the man in the corner said. “Regardless ofhow dangerous the magic required to accomplish it.”“Yes.”The Defense Professor’s eyes were thoughtful. “But what general approach did you have in mind? I presume that turning her corpse into anInferius is not what you—”“Would she be able to think?” the boy said. “Would her body still decay?”“No, and yes.”“Then no.”“What of the Resurrection Stone of Cadmus Peverell, if it could beobtained for you?”The boy shook his head. “I don’t want an illusion of Hermione drawnfrom my memories. I want her to be able to live her life—” the boy’s voicecracked. “I haven’t decided yet on an object-level angle of attack. If I haveto brute-force the problem by acquiring enough power and knowledge tojust make it happen, I will.”Another pause.1510 *“And to go about that,” the man in the corner said, “you will use yourfavorite tool, science.”“Of course.”The Defense Professor exhaled, almost like a sigh. “I suppose thatmakes sense of it.”“Are you willing to help, or not?” the boy said.“What help do you seek?”“Magic. Where does it come from?”“I do not know,” said the man.“And neither does anyone else?”“Oh, the situation is far worse than that, Mr. Potter. There is hardlya scholar of the esoteric who has not unraveled the nature of magic, andevery one of them believes something different.”“Where do new spells come from? I keep reading about someone whoinvented a spell to do something-or-other but there’s no mention of how.”A shrug of robed shoulders. “Where do new books come from, Mr. Potter? Those who read many books sometimes become able to write themin turn. How? No one knows.”“There are books on how to write—”“Reading them will not make you a famous playwright. After all suchadvice is accounted for, what remains is mystery. The invention of newspells is a similar mystery of purer form.” The man’s head tilted. “Suchendeavors are dangerous. The saying is that one should either not havechildren, or else wait until after they are grown. There is a reason why somany innovators seem to hail from Gryffindor, rather than Ravenclaw asmight be expected.”“And the more powerful sorts of magics?” the boy said.“A legendary wizard might invent one sacrificial ritual in his life, andpass on the knowledge to his heirs. To try inventing five such would besuicide. That is why wizards of true power are those who have acquiredancient lore.”The boy nodded distantly. “So much for the direct solution, then. Itwould’ve been nice to just invent a spell for ‘Raise Dead’, ‘Become God’ or‘Summon Terminal’. Do you know anything about Atlantis?”“Only what any scholar knows,” the man said dryly. “If you wouldlike to hear about the top eighteen standard theories—do not glare at me,Mr. Potter. If it were that simple, I would have done it many years earlier.”“I understand. Sorry.”There was a time of silence. The Defense Professor’s gaze rested onthe boy, the boy stared off seemingly at nothing.“There’s some magics I mean to learn. Spells I could’ve used earliertoday, if I’d thought to study them beforehand.” The boy’s voice was cold.“Spells I’ll need, if this sort of thing goes on happening. Most I expect Ican just look up. Some I expect I can’t.”The Defense Professor inclined his head. “I shall teach you almost anymagic you wish to know, Mr. Potter. I do have some limits, but you mayalways ask. But what specifically do you seek? You lack the raw power forthe Killing Curse and most other spells deemed forbidden—”“That spell of cursed fire. I don’t suppose it’s a sacrificial ritual thateven a child could use, if he dared?”The Defense Professor’s lips twitched. “It requires the permanent sacrifice of a drop of blood; your body would be lighter by that drop of blood,from that day forward. Not the sort of thing one would wish to do often,Mr. Potter. Strength of will is demanded for the cursed fire not to turnupon you and consume you; the usual practice is to first test one’s will inlesser trials. And although it is not a primary element of the ritual, I amafraid that it does require more magic than you shall possess for anotherfew years.”“Pity,” the boy said. “It would’ve been nice to see the look on the enemy’s face the next time they tried using a troll.”The Defense Professor inclined his head, his lips twitching again.“What about Memory Charms? The Weasley twins were acting oddlyand the Headmaster said he thinks they’ve been Obliviated. It seems tobe one of the enemy’s favorite tricks.”“Rule Eight,” said the Defense Professor. “Any technique which isgood enough to defeat me once is good enough to learn myself.”The boy smiled humorlessly. “And I once heard about an adult castingObliviate while she was almost completely drained, so it must not take1512 *too much magic to cast. It’s not even considered Unforgiveable, though Ican’t imagine why not. If I could’ve made Mr. Hagrid remember a different set of orders—”“It is not that straightforward,” said the Defense Professor. “You arenot powerful enough to use the False Memory Charm, and even a simpleObliviation will stretch the edge of your current stamina. It is a dangerous art, illegal to use without Ministry authorization, and I would cautionyou not to use it under circumstances where it would be inconvenient toaccidentally erase ten years of someone’s life. I wish I could promise youthat I would obtain one of those highly guarded tomes from the Department of Mysteries, and pass it to you beneath a disguised cover. But whatI must actually tell you is that you will find the standard introductory textin the north-northwest stacks of the main Hogwarts library, filed under“Seriously,” the boy said flatly.“Indeed.”“Thank you for your guidance, Professor.”“Your creativity has become a great deal more practical, Mr. Potter,since I have known you.”“Thank you for the compliment.” The boy did not look up from wherehe was again gazing down at the wand held between his hands. “I wouldlike to go back to thinking now. Please explain to them on my behalf whathappens if I am disturbed.”The door to the storeroom clicked open, and Professor Quirrell steppedout. His face had a dead, emotionless look to it; she would have said thatit reminded her of Severus, though Severus had never looked quite likethat.Even as the door clicked shut again, Minerva had thrown up a wordless Quieting barrier. The words spilled forth from her rapidly: “How didit go—you were in there for a while—is Harry talking now?”Professor Quirrell paced swiftly across the room to the far wall nearthe entrance, looked back at her. The emotionlessness slid off his face,1513 *as though he were taking off a mask, leaving behind someone very grim.“I spoke to Mr. Potter as he expected me to speak, and avoided sayingthings that would annoy him. I do not think it consoled him. I do notthink I have the knack.”“Thank you—it is good that he spoke at all—” She hesitated. “Whatdid Mr. Potter say?”“I am afraid that I promised him not to speak of it. And now… I thinkthat I must visit the Hogwarts library.”“The library?”“Yes,” Professor Quirrell said. An uncharacteristic tension had comeinto his voice. “I intend to strengthen the security upon the RestrictedSection with certain precautions of my own devising. The current wardsare a joke. And Mr. Potter must be kept out of the Restricted Section atall costs.”She stared at the Defense Professor, her heart suddenly in her throat.Professor Quirrell continued speaking. “You will not tell the boy thatI have said this much to you. You will confirm to Flitwick and Vector thatthe boy is to be diverted by the usual evasions if he asks precocious questions about spell creation. And though it is not my own area of expertise,Deputy Headmistress, if there is any way you can imagine to convincethe boy to stop sinking further into his grief and madness—any way atall to undo the resolutions he is coming to—then I suggest you resort toit immediately.”1514 *hortly after, there was another knock upon the storeroom door.“If you actually care about my mental health,” the boy said without looking up, “you will go away, leave me alone, and wait for me to comedown to dinner. This isn’t helping.”The door opened, and the one who had waited outside stepped in.“Seriously?” the boy said flatly.The door closed and clicked behind Severus Snape.The Potions Master of Hogwarts wore none of his customary arrogance, or even the dispassionate guise that he ordinarily took in the Headmaster’s office; his gaze was strange, as he looked down upon the boyguarding that door; his thoughts unfathomable.“I also cannot imagine what the Deputy Headmistress is thinking,”said the Potions Master of Hogwarts. “Unless I am meant to serve as awarning of where it will lead you, if you decide to take the blame for herdeath upon yourself.”The boy’s lips pressed together. “Fine. Let’s just skip ahead to the endof this conversation. You win, Professor Snape. I concede that you weremore responsible for Lily Potter’s death than I was responsible for Hermione Granger’s death, and that my guilt can’t stack up to your guilt. Andthen I ask you to go, and you tell them that it would probably be best tolet me alone for a while. Are we done?”“Almost,” the Potions Master said. “I am the one who put the notesunder Miss Granger’s pillow, telling her where to find the fights in whichshe intervened.”The boy did not react to this at all. Finally he spoke. “Because youdislike bullying.”1515 *“Not that alone.” There was a note of pain in the Potions Master’svoice that sounded alien to it; it was hard to imagine it being the sameacid voice that instructed children not to stir one more time or they’dblow off their wrists. “I should have realized it… very much earlier, I suppose, and yet I did not see it at all, being entirely absorbed in myself. Forme to be placed as Head of Slytherin… it means that Albus Dumbledorehas entirely lost hope that Slytherin House can be helped. I am certainthat Dumbledore must have tried, I cannot imagine that he did not try,when he first took trust of Hogwarts. It must have been a severe blow tohim, when after that so much of Slytherin answered to the Dark Lord’scall… he would not have placed me in authority over that House, actingas I did, unless he had lost all hope.” The Potions Master’s shoulders fell,beneath his spotted and stained cloak. “But you and Miss Granger weretrying to do something, and the two of you had even managed to bringover Mr. Malfoy and Miss Greengrass, and perhaps those two could haveset a different example… I suppose it was foolish for me to believe. TheHeadmaster does not know of what I have done, and I ask you not to tellhim.”“Why are you telling me this?”“Matters have become far too serious not to tell someone.” SeverusSnape’s lips twisted. “I have seen enough disastrous plotting, in mytenure as Head of Slytherin, to know how that sometimes goes. If, in thefuture, all should come to light—then at least I have told you, and youmay say as much.”“Lovely,” the boy said. “Thank you for clearing that up. Is that all?”“Do you intend to declare that your life is now a ruin and that there isnothing left for you but vengeance?”“No. I still have—” The boy cut himself off.“Then there is very little advice that I can give you,” said SeverusSnape.The boy nodded distantly. “On Hermione’s behalf, thank you for helping her with the bullies. She would tell you that it was the right thing todo. And now I would be much obliged if you could tell them to leave mealone.”1516 *The Potions Master turned to the door, and when his face was unseen,his voice came in a whisper. “I truly am sorry for your loss.”Severus Snape departed.The boy stared after him, trying to remember, as best as he could atthis distance, words which had been spoken some time earlier.Your books betrayed you, Potter. They did not tell you the one thing you neededto know. You cannot learn from books what it is like to lose the one you love. Thatis something you could never know without experiencing it for yourself.It had gone something like that, the boy thought, if he was remembering correctly.Hours had passed now, in the infirmary section with its closed door anda body lying in state behind it.Harry went on staring at his wand, as it lay in his lap. At the tinyscratches and smudges on the eleven inches of holly, flaws he’d neverlooked closely enough to notice before. A quick mental calculation saidthere was no reason to worry since if this was six or seven months’ accumulation of damage, then a standard lifetime wouldn’t wear awaythe wand entirely. At the time, he probably would’ve worried about hisown Time-Turner being taken away if he’d just openly yelled out ‘Doesanyone have a Time-Turner?’ into the Great Hall, but it would have beeneasy enough to precommit to, after lunch, finding someone to send Professor Flitwick a message two hours earlier and then Professor Flitwickcould’ve just gone straight to Hermione, or sent her his raven Patronus,long before the troll was anywhere near her. Or might that alternateHarry have already learned it was too late—heard about Hermione’sdeath after lunch and before he could buy any messages sent backwardsin time? Maybe a basic guideline of working with time-travel was tomake sure you never risked learning you were too late, if you hadn’t yetgone backwards. There was a tiny chemical burn now on the end of hiswand, presumably from contacting the acid he’d partially Transfiguredthe troll’s brain into, but the wand seemed robust against losses of small1517 *amounts of wood. Really the concept of a ‘magic wand’ being requiredjust got stranger the more you thought about it. Though if spells werealways being invented in some mysterious way, new rituals being carvedas new levers upon the unknown machine, it might just be that peoplejust kept inventing rituals that involved wands, just like they inventedphrases like ‘Wingardium Leviosa’. It really seemed like magic ought tobe, in some sense, almost arbitrarily powerful, and it certainly would beconvenient if Harry could just bypass whatever conceptual limitationprevented people from inventing spells like ‘Just Fix Everything Forever’,but somehow nothing was ever that easy where magic was concerned.Harry looked at his mechanical watch again, but it still wasn’t time.He’d attempted to cast the Patronus Charm, meaning to tell his Patronus to go to Hermione Granger. Just in case it was all a lie, a FalseMemory Charm or one of the who-knew-how-many-ways that wizardscould be made to close their eyes and dream. Just in case the real Hermione was alive and being held somewhere, despite his feeling her life as itleft her. Just in case there was an afterlife and the True Patronus couldreach it.The spell hadn’t worked though, so that particular test had failed toprovide any evidence, leaving him with the previous, unfavorable prior.Time passed, and yet more time. From the outside you would’ve justseen a boy, sitting, staring at his wand with an abstracted gaze, lookingat his watch every two minutes or so.The door to the infirmary section opened once again.The boy sitting there looked up with a deadly, chilling glare.Then the boy’s face cracked in dismay, and he scrambled to his feet.“Harry,” said the man in the button-down formal shirt and a black vestthrown over it. His voice was hoarse. “Harry, what’s happening? TheHeadmaster of your school—he showed up in those ridiculous robes atmy office and told me that Hermione Granger was dead!”A moment later a woman followed the man into the room; she seemedless confused than the man, less bewildered and more frightened.“Dad,” the boy said thinly. “Mum. Yes, she’s dead. They didn’t tell youanything else?”“No! Harry, what’s happening?”1518 *There was a pause.The boy slumped back against the wall. “I c-can’t, I can’t, I can’t dothis.”“What?”“I can’t pretend to be a little boy, I j-just don’t have the energy rightnow.”“Harry,” the woman said falteringly. “Harry—”“Dad, you know those fantasy books where the hero has to hide everything from his parents because they, they wouldn’t understand, they’dreact stupidly and get in the hero’s way? It’s a plot device, right, so thatthe hero has to solve everything himself instead of telling his parents. Pplease don’t be that plot device, Dad, or you either, Mum. Just… just don’tplay that role. Don’t be the parents who won’t understand. D-don’t yellat me and give me parental demands I can’t follow. Because I’ve wandered into a bloody stupid fantasy novel and now Hermione’s—I j-justdon’t have the energy to deal with it.”Slowly, as though his limbs were only half-animated, the man in theblack vest kneeled down to where Harry was standing, so that his eyeswere level with his son’s. “Harry,” the man said. “I need you to tell meeverything that has happened, right now.”The boy took a deep breath, swallowed. “They t-tell me the Dark Lord Idefeated may still be alive. Like that’s not the p-plot of a hundred soddingbooks, right? So, it could also be that the Headmaster of my school, who’sthe most powerful wizard in the world, has gone insane. And, and Hermione was framed for an attempted murder just before this, not that anyone would’ve told her parents about it or anything. The student she wasframed for attempted-murdering was the son of Lucius Malfoy, who’sthe most powerful politician in magical Britain, and used to be the DarkLord’s number two. The Defense Professor position at this school has acurse on it, nobody ever lasts more than a year, they have a saying that theDefense Professor is always a suspect. This year the Defense Professor issecretly a mysterious wizard who opposed the Dark Lord during the lastwar and may or may not be evil himself. Also the Potions Master has beenpining after Lily Potter for years and might be behind this whole thing for1519 *some twisted psychological reason.” The boy’s lips pressed together bitterly. “I think that’s most of the bloody stupid plot.”The man, who had listened to all this quietly, stood up. He put a gentlehand on the boy’s shoulder. “That’s enough, Harry,” he said. “I’ve heardenough. We’re leaving this school right now and taking you with us.”The woman was looking at the boy, her face asking a question.The boy gazed back at her and nodded.The woman’s voice was thin when she spoke. “They won’t let us,Michael.”“They have no legal right to stop us—”“Right? You’re Muggles,” said the boy. He smiled twistedly. “You haveas much standing in the magical British legal system as mice. No wizardis going to care about any arguments you make about rights, about fairness,they won’t even take the time to listen. You don’t have any power, see, sothey don’t have to bother. No, Mum, I’m not smiling like this because Iagree with their Muggle policies, I’m smiling because I disagree with yourchildren policies.”“Then,” Professor Michael Verres-Evans said firmly, “we shall seewhat the real government has to say about that. I know an MP or three—”“They’ll say, you’re crazy, have a nice stay in this asylum. That’s assuming the Ministry Obliviators don’t get to you first and erase your memories. They do that to Muggles a lot, I hear. I figure the real higherups in our government have formed some cozy accomodations of theirown. Maybe they get a few healing Charms now and then, if someoneimportant manages to get cancer.” The boy gave that twisted smile again.“And that’s the situation, Dad, as Mum already knows. They’d never havebrought you here or told you anything, if there was a single thing youcould do about it.”The man’s mouth opened but no words came out, as though he hadbeen reading from a script which described what a concerned parentought to do in this sort of situation, and this script had suddenly arrivedat a blank spot.“Harry,” the woman said falteringly.The boy looked at her.“Harry, did something happen to you? You seem… different…”“Petunia!” the man said, his tongue apparently working once more.“Don’t say such things! He’s under stress, that’s all.”“Well, Mum, you see—” The boy’s voice cracked. “Are you sure youwant this all at once, Mum?”The woman nodded, though she didn’t speak.“I’ve got… you know how that school psychiatrist thought I had angermanagement problems? Well—” The boy stopped, and swallowed. “Idon’t know how to explain this to you, Mum. It’s something magicalinstead. Probably something to do with whatever happened on the nightmy parents died. I have… well, I was calling it a mysterious dark sideand I know it sounds like a joke and I did check with… with an ancienttelepathic magical hat to make sure my scar wasn’t actually inhabited bythe Dark Lord’s spirit and it said that there was only one person underits brim and I don’t think wizards have actual souls anyway since theycan still suffer from brain damage, only—”“Harry, slow down!” said the man.“—only, only whatever it is, it’s still real, there’s something inside me,it gave me willpower when things were bad, I could face down anythingso long as I was angry, Snape, Dumbledore, the entire Wizengamot, mydark side wasn’t afraid of anything but Dementors. And I wasn’t stupid, Iknew that there might be a price for using my dark side and I kept on looking to see what the price might be. It didn’t change my magic, it didn’tseem to cause permanent alignment shift, it didn’t try to take me awayfrom my friends or anything like that, so I kept on using it whenever Ihad to and I only figured out too late what the price really was—” Theboy’s voice had become almost a whisper. “I only figured out today… every time I call on it… it uses up my childhood. I killed the thing that gotHermione. And it wasn’t my dark side that did it, it was me. Oh, Mum,Dad, I’m sorry.”There was a long silence filled with the sound of broken masks.“Harry,” the man said, kneeling down again, “I need you to start overfrom the beginning and explain that much more slowly.”The boy spoke.The parents listened.Some time later, the father stood up.1521 *The boy looked up at him, grimacing in bitter anticipation.“Harry,” the man said, “Petunia and I are going to get you out of hereas quickly as possible—”“Don’t,” the boy said warningly. “I mean it, Dad. The Ministry ofMagic isn’t something you can stand up to. Pretend they’re the tax office or the dean or something else that won’t brook any challenge to theirdominance. In magical Britain you’re only allowed to remember whatthe government thinks you should remember, and remembering the existence of magic or that you have a son named Harry is a privilege, nota right. And if they did that I’d crack and turn the Ministry into a giantflaming crater. Mum, you know the score, you absolutely have to stopDad from trying anything stupid.”“And son—” The man rubbed at his temples. “Maybe I shouldn’t saythis now… but are you sure that what you’re talking about is really a magical dark side, and not something normal for a boy your age?”“Normal,” the boy said with elaborate patience. “Normal how, exactly?I could check again, but I’m reasonably sure there wasn’t anything aboutthis in Childcraft: A Guide For Parents. My dark side isn’t just an emotionalstate, it makes me smarter. In some ways, anyhow. You can’t just pretendyourself smarter.”The man rubbed at his head again. “Well… there’s a certain wellknown phenomenon wherein children undergo a biological processwhich can sometimes make them angry and dark and grim, and thisprocess also significantly increases their intelligence and their height—”The boy slumped back against the wall. “No, Dad, it’s not that I’mturning into a teenager. I checked with my brain and it still thinks thatgirls are icky. But if that’s what you want to pretend, then fine. MaybeI’m better off with you not believing me. I just—” The boy’s voice choked.“I just couldn’t stand lying about it.”“Adolescence doesn’t necessarily work like that, Harry. It may stilltake a while for you to notice girls. If, in fact, you haven’t noticed onealrea—” and the man abruptly stopped.“I didn’t like Hermione in that way,” the boy whispered. “Why doeseveryone keep thinking it has to be about that? It’s disrespectful to her,to think someone could only like her in that way.”The man swallowed visibly. “Anyway, son, you keep yourself safewhile we work on getting you out of here, is that understood? Don’t yougo actually thinking that you’ve turned to the dark side. I know you’vehad, ah, what I used to call your Ender Wiggin moments—”“I think we are now well past Ender and on to Ender after the buggerskill Valentine.”“Language!” said the woman, and then her hand flew to cover hermouth.The boy spoke wearily. “Not that kind of bugger, Mum. They’re insectoid aliens—never mind.”“Harry, that’s exactly what I’m saying you shouldn’t think,” ProfessorVerres-Evans said firmly. “You’re not to go believing that you’re turningevil. You are not to hurt anyone, place yourself in harm’s way, or messaround with any sort of black magic whatsoever, while your Mum and Iwork on extracting you from this situation. Is that clear, son?”The boy closed his eyes. “That’d be wonderful advice, Dad, if only Iwere in a comic book.”“Harry—” the man began.“Police can’t do that. Soldiers can’t do that. The most powerful wizardin the world couldn’t do that, and he tried. It’s not fair to the innocentbystanders to play at being Batman if you can’t actually protect everyoneunder that code. And I’ve just proven that I can’t.”Beads of sweat were glistening on Professor Michael Verres-Evans’sforehead. “Now you listen to me. No matter what you’ve read in books,you aren’t supposed to be protecting anyone! Or involving yourself in anything dangerous! Absolutely anything dangerous whatsoever! Just stayout of the way of everything, every bit of craziness going on in this madhouse, while we get you out of here the first instant we possibly can!”The boy looked searchingly at his father, then his mother. Then helooked at his wristwatch again.“Excellent point,” said the boy.The boy marched over to the door leading outward, and flung it open.The door flew open with a crack that caused Minerva to startle where shestood, and before she had time to think, Harry Potter marched out of theroom, glaring directly at her.“You brought my parents here,” the Boy-Who-Lived said. “To Hogwarts. Where You-Know-Who or someone is lurking around, targeting myfriends. What exactly were you thinking?”She did not reply that she had been thinking about Harry sitting infront of the door to the storeroom containing Hermione’s body, refusingto move.“Who else knows about this?” Harry Potter demanded. “Did anyonesee them with you?”“The Headmaster brought them here—”“I want them out of here immediately before anyone else notices, especially You-Know-Who, but also including Professor Quirrell or ProfessorSnape. Please send your Patronus to the Headmaster and tell him that heneeds to bring it back at once. Do not mention my parents by name, oras people, in case somebody else is listening.”“Indeed,” said Professor Verres-Evans, nodding sternly along withthis from where he stood directly behind the boy, Petunia a step behindhim. His hand rested firmly on Harry’s shoulder. “We’ll finish talking toour son at home.”“A moment, please,” Minerva said in reflexive politeness. Her firsttry at casting the Patronus failed, a disadvantage of that Charm undercertain circumstances. It wasn’t the first time she’d done it so, but sheseemed to have lost some of the knack—Minerva shut the thought down and concentrated.When the message was sent, she turned back to Professor VerresEvans. “Sir,” she said, “I’m afraid that Mr. Potter must not leave the Hogwarts School—”By the time Albus finally arrived, there was shouting, the Muggle manhaving given up on dignity. At least there was shouting on one side of theargument. Minerva’s heart wasn’t in it. The truth was that she couldn’tbelieve the words coming out of her mouth.When the Professor turned to argue with the Headmaster, Harry Potter, who had remained silent through this, spoke up. “Not here,” saidHarry. “You can argue with him anywhere but Hogwarts, Dad. Mum,please, please make sure that Dad doesn’t try anything that will get himin trouble with the Ministry.”Michael Verres-Evans’s face screwed up. He turned, looked at HarryPotter. When his voice came out it was hoarse, accompanied by water inhis eyes. “Son—what are you doing?”“You know perfectly well what I’m doing,” Harry Potter said. “Youread those comic books long before you gave them to me. I’ve beenthrough a bunch of crap, matured a bit, and now I’m protecting my relatives. Actually, it’s simpler than that, you know what I’m doing becauseyou tried to do the same thing. I’m having my loved ones taken out ofHogwarts immediately, that’s what I’m doing. Headmaster, please getthem out of here before You-Know-Who discovers their presence andmarks them for death.”Michael Verres-Evans began a frantic dash toward Harry, and thenall motion stopped with the Muggle man leaning forward in his flight.“I am sorry,” the Headmaster said quietly. “We shall speak more soon.Minerva, I was with the others when you called, they are waiting in youroffice.”The Headmaster passed forwards like he was gliding, until he stoodin the midst of where the man and woman stood frozen; and there wasanother flash of flame.Motion resumed.Minerva looked at Harry.Words did not come to her.“Clever move, bringing them here,” Harry Potter said. “Probably damaged our relationship permanently. All I wanted was to be bloody leftalone until bloody dinnertime. Which,” the boy looked at his wristwatch,“it now is anyway. I’m going to go say goodbye to Hermione by myself,which I promise will take less than two minutes, and then after that I’llcome out and go eat something like I would have done regardless. Donot disturb me for those two bloody minutes or I will snap and try to killsomeone, I mean it, Professor.”The boy turned and strode into the small room, opened the rear doorto where Hermione Granger’s body was being kept, and strode inside be* 1525 *fore she could think to speak. Through the doorway she saw a flash of asight she knew no child ought to see—The door slammed shut.She started forwards, unthinking.Halfway to the door, she stopped herself.Her mind was still slow, and hurting, and the part of her that HarryPotter would have called the picture of a stern disciplinarian was lifelesslymouthing words about inappropriate behavior from children. The rest ofher didn’t think it was a good idea to leave any child, even Harry Potter,alone in a room with the bloody corpse of his best friend. But the act ofopening the door, or asserting any sort of authority, did not seem to herwise. There was no right thing to do, and no right thing to say; or if therewas any right path, she did not know it.Very slowly, a minute and a half passed.When the door opened again, Harry seemed to have changed, as thoughthat minute and a half had passed over the course of lifetimes.“Seal up the room,” Harry said quietly, “and let’s go, Professor McGonagall.”She walked over to the storeroom door. She wasn’t quite able to stopherself from looking in, and saw the dried blood, the sheet covering thelower half, the upper body waxy and doll-like, and a glimpse of HermioneGranger’s closed eyes. Something inside her began its weeping all overagain.She closed the door.Her fingers moved upon her wand, her mouth spoke words withoutthought, Charms and wards to seal the room against entry.“Professor McGonagall,” Harry said in a strange voice, as if by rote,“do you have the rock? The rock that the Headmaster gave me? I shouldTransfigure it into a jewel again, since it did prove useful.”Automatically her eyes went to the ring on Harry’s left pinky finger,noting the emptiness of the setting where the jewel should have been. “Ishall mention it to the Headmaster,” her tongue replied.“Is that a usual tactic, by the way?” Harry said, voice still odd. “Carrying something large Transfigured into something small to use as aweapon? Or is that a usual exercise for Transfiguration practice?”Distantly, she shook her head.“Well, let’s go, then.”“I have—” her voice stopped. “I’m afraid I have something else whichI must do, now. Will you be all right on your own, and will you promiseto go to the Great Hall directly and eat something, Mr. Potter?”The boy promised (barring exceptional and unforeseen circumstances, a clause with which she did not argue) and then walked out ofthe room.What lay ahead of her… would be no easier, certainly, and might wellbe harder.Minerva walked to her office at a swift pace; not slowly, for that wouldhave been a discourtesy.Professor McGonagall opened the door to her office.“Madam Granger,” her voice said, “Mr. Granger, I am so terribly sorryfor—”here was nothing left to do.There was nothing left to plan.There was nothing left to think.Into that emptiness rose the new worst memory—The Boy-Who-Lived-Unlike-His-Best-Friend trudged the long, echoing corridors toward the Great Hall. With all his energies of thought exhausted, his mind was starting to throw out thoughts like an image ofHermione walking beside him and wordless concepts like That will neverhappen again until another part yelled No and shouted it down with determination to bring her back, only that part’s voice was getting tired andthe other part seemed tireless. Another part of his mind insisted on reviewing what he’d said to Professor McGonagall and Dad and Mum, eventhough he’d only been trying to get them out of there as quickly as possible and had been running on limited mental energy. As though somehowhe could have done better, by an act of his defective will. What would beleft of his relationship with his parents now, Harry couldn’t guess.He came finally to a junction where there waited a older boy in greenfringed black robes, silently reading a textbook, on the path that anyonewould pick if they wanted to intercept someone going from the healer’schambers to the Great Hall.Harry was wearing the Cloak of Invisibility, of course, he’d put it onafter leaving the office, rendering himself immune to almost all formsof magical detection. There was no point in making it easy for anyonetrying to find him and kill him. And Harry was almost set to continue pastwithout bothering to find out what was going on, when he recognized theSlytherin boy’s face.Realization dawned on Harry then. Of course, one of the studentswho had stayed in school over the Easter holiday would naturally havebeen—“You were waiting for me,” Harry said out loud, without removing theCloak.The Slytherin boy jerked back, hitting his head against the wall, hisfifth-year Charms textbook dropping from his hands, before he lookedup with wide eyes.“You’re—”“Invisible. Yes. Say what you mean to say.”Lesath Lestrange scrambled to his feet, a position of attention, thenblurted out, “My lord, did I do the right thing—I thought you would notwish me to step forward before all those others, that they might suspectour connection—I thought, surely if you wished my help you would callon me—”It was amazing how many different ways there were to kill your bestfriend by being stupid.“I—” Lesath hesitated, then said in a small voice, “I was wrong, wasn’t“You acted exactly as you should have, under the circumstances. It isI who was a fool.”“I’m sorry, my lord,” whispered Lesath.“If you had come with me, would you have been able to kill the troll?” Itwasn’t even the correct question, the correct question was whether Harryhimself would have considered Lesath as sufficient and flown out sixtyseconds earlier, but still…“I… I’m not sure, my lord… I am not much welcome to duelling practices in Slytherin, I have not learned the gestures to the Killing Curse—should I study those arts to better serve you, my lord?”“I continue to insist that I am not your lord,” Harry said.“Yes, my lord.”“Although,” Harry said, “and this is not any kind of order, just a remark, anyone ought to know how to defend themselves, especially you.I’m sure the Defense Professor would help you with that on general principles, if you asked.”Lesath Lestrange bowed and said, “Yes, my lord, I will follow your orders if I can, my lord.”Harry would have complained about being misunderstood, if hehadn’t been understood perfectly.Lesath left.Harry stared at the wall.He’d honestly thought that he’d already figured out all the differentways that he’d been stupid, after spending half a day thinking about it.Apparently this had just been more overconfidence on his part.Do we understand what we did wrong? his Slytherin side said coldly.Yes, Harry thought.Your ethical qualms don’t even make sense. You’re not tricking Lesath. Youdid exactly what Lesath thinks you did. You wouldn’t have to make excuses forwhy Lesath was helping you, you could just say you were calling in the debt fromrescuing him from bullies, there were six witnesses to that. Hermione died becauseyou forgot about an extremely valuable resource, and you forgot about Lesath because… why?Because having Lesath Lestrange for a minion seemed sort of Dark-Lordish?Hufflepuff said in a small mental voice. I mean… that decision was probablymostly me…Harry’s Slytherin side didn’t answer that in words, just radiated contempt and flashed an image of Hermione’s corpse.Stop it! Harry screamed internally.Next time, Slytherin said icily, I suggest that we spend more time worryingabout what is efficient and effective, and less time worrying about what seems sortof Dark-Lordish.Point made, Harry thought, I will.No, you won’t, said Slytherin. You’ll come up with more rationalisations foryour petty qualms. You’ll start listening to me after your next friend dies.Harry was starting to worry that he was going insane. The conversations he had with the voices in his head weren’t usually like this.The Boy-Who-LivedpainHarry Verres trudged on alonehurts1531 *Harry walked on through the silent corridors.“How is Mr. Potter doing?” demanded Professor Quirrell. There was atension about the man, you could not quite call it concern, more like anambusher measuring the time to strike. The Grangers had hardly leftwith Madam Pomfrey before the Defense Professor had knocked uponthe door to her office and then entered without waiting for her answer,and spoken before she could say a word. Part of Minerva wondered distantly whether Harry Potter had picked up that habit from his DefenseProfessor, being unaware of others’ pain when there was something elseon his mind, or if it was only a childish flaw which this man had somehowfailed to grow out of.“Mr. Potter has ceased guarding Miss Granger’s body,” she said,putting some of the chill she felt into her voice. She felt certain that theDefense Professor was not experiencing as much grief as she was, theman had spoken not a single word of Hermione Granger. For him to putdemands on her—“I believe he has gone down to dinner.”“I am not asking after the boy’s physical state! Have you—has he—”Professor Quirrell made a sharp gesture, as though to indicate a conceptfor which he had no words.“Not particularly,” she said. She was around thirty seconds away fromordering the Defense Professor out of her office.Professor Quirrell began to pace within the small confines of her office. “Miss Granger was the only one whose worries he truly heeded—with her gone—all checks on the boy’s recklessness are removed. I seeit now. Who else is there? Mr. Longbottom? Mr. Potter does not pretend that they are peers. Flitwick? His goblin blood would only cry forvengeance. Mr. Malfoy, if he were returned? To what end? Snape? Awalking disaster. Dumbledore? Pfah. Events are already set for catastrophe, they must be steered along some course they would not naturallygo. Who might Mr. Potter heed, who would not ordinarily speak to him?Cedric Diggory has taught him, but what would Mr. Diggory say in advice? An unknown. Mr. Potter spent long in speech with Remus Lupin.To him I have paid little heed. Would Lupin know the words to speak, theact which must be done, the sacrifice which must be made to change theboy’s course?” Professor Quirrell whirled on her. “Did Remus Lupin comfort those in grief or stay those moved to rash deeds, during his time withthe Order of the Phoenix?”“It is not a poor thought,” she said slowly. “I believe that Mr. Lupinwas often a voice of restraint to James Potter in his Hogwarts days.”“James Potter,” said Professor Quirrell, his eyes narrowing. “The boyis not much like James Potter. Are you confident in the success of thisplan? No, that is the wrong question, we are not limited to a single plan.Are you certain that this plan will be enough, that we need essay no others?Asked in such fashion, the question answers itself. The path leading todisaster must be averted along every possible point of intervention.” TheDefense Professor had resumed pacing the confines of her office, reaching one wall, turning on his heel, pacing to the other.“My apologies, Professor,” she did not bother keeping the sharpnessfrom her voice, “but I have quite reached my limits for the day. You maygo.”“You.” Professor Quirrell spun, and she found herself gazing directlyinto eyes of icy blue. “You would be the first one I would think of afterMiss Granger, to stay the boy from a folly. Have you already done yourutmost? Of course you have not.”How dare he suggest that. “If you have nothing more to say, Professor,then you will go.”“Has your confederacy deduced who I really am?” The words werespoken with deceptive mildness.“Yes, in fact. Now—”Pure magic, pure power crashed into the room like a flash of lightning,like a thunderclap echoing about her ears that deafened her other senses,the papers on her desk blown aside not by any conjured wind but by thesheer raw force of arcane might.Then the power subsided, leaving only Hermione Granger’s death certificates drifting down through the air to the floor.“I am David Monroe, who fought Voldemort,” the man said, still inmild tones. “Heed my words. The boy cannot be allowed to continuein this state of mind. He will become dangerous. It is possible that youhave already done everything you can. Yet I find this a very rare event indeed, and more often said than done. I suspect rather that you have onlydone what you customarily do. I cannot truly comprehend what drivesothers to break their bounds, since I never had them. People remain surprisingly passive when faced with the prospect of death. Fear of publicridicule or losing one’s livelihood is more likely to drive men to extremesand the breaking of their customary habits. On the other side of the war,the Dark Lord had excellent results from the Cruciatus Curse, judiciouslyused on Marked servants who cannot escape punishment except by success, with no reasonable efforts accepted. Imagine their state of mindwithin yourself, and ask yourself whether you have truly done all that youcan to wrench Harry Potter from his course.”“I am a Gryffindor and not much given to being moved by fear,” shesnapped back. “You will exercise courtesy within my office!”“I find fear an excellent motivation, and indeed it is fear that movesme now. You-Know-Who, for all his horror, still abided by certain boundaries. It is my professional judgment, speaking as a learned wizard almost on par with Dumbledore or He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, that theboy could join the ranks of those whose rituals are inscribed upon thetombstones of countries. This is not an idle worry, McGonagall, I havealready heard words to produce the gravest apprehensions.”“Are you mad? You think that Mr. Potter could—this is ridiculous.Mr. Potter cannot possibly—”A wordless image crossed her mind of a patch of glass on a steel ball.“—Mr. Potter would not do such a thing!”“His deliberate choice is not required. Wizards rarely set out to invoketheir own dooms. Mr. Potter may not strike you as malicious. Does hestrike you as reckless once he is resolved upon a goal? I say again that Ihave specific reason for the gravest possible concerns!”“Have you spoken to the Headmaster of this?” she said slowly.“That would be worse than pointless. Dumbledore cannot reach theboy. At best he is wise enough to know this and make things no worse. Ilack the requisite frame of mind. You are the one who—but I see that youstill look for others to save you.” The Defense Professor turned from her,and strode to the door. “I think I shall consult with Severus Snape. Theman may be a walking disaster, but he knows the fact, and he may possessa greater understanding of that boy’s mood. As for you, madam, imagineyourself at the end of your life, knowing that Britain—but no, Britain isnot your true country, is it? Imagine yourself at the end of your life as thedarkness eats through the fading walls of Hogwarts, knowing that yourstudents will die with you, remembering this day and realizing there wassomething else you could have done.”had walked into the Great Hall, looked around only once,Harrygrabbedenough calories to sustain himself, walked out, put on hisCloak again and found a small random corner in which to eat. Seeingthe students at their tables—Feeling revulsion when you look at other humans is not a good sign, Hufflepuff said. It’s not reasonable to blame them for having not had your opportunities to learn what you’ve learned. Inaction in emergencies has nothing to dowith people being selfish. Normalcy bias, like that plane crash in Tener-somethingwhere a few people ran out and escaped but most people just sat in their seats notmoving while their plane was literally on fire. Look at how long you took to reallystart moving.It serves no useful purpose to hate, said Gryffindor. It’s just going to damageyour altruism.Try to figure out a training method you could use to prevent this from happening next time, said Ravenclaw.I’ll go ahead and register the experimental prediction, said Slytherin, thatwe’ll always observe exactly what would be predicted on the hypothesis that peoplecannot be saved, cannot be taught, and will never help us with anything important. Also, we need some way of keeping track of all the times I’m right.Harry ignored the voices in his head and just ate slices of toast as fastas he could. It wasn’t proper nutrition as a general policy, but one-timeexceptions wouldn’t hurt so long as he made them up the next day.In mid-bite, the blazing silver silhouette of a phoenix flew in fromnowhere and said, in the voice of a tired old man, “Please remove yourCloak, Harry, I have a letter to deliver to you.”Harry coughed for a bit, swallowed some toast which had gone downthe wrong way, stood up, took off the Cloak of Invisibility, said aloud“Tell Dumbledore I said fine,” and then sat down and continued to eathis toast.The toast had all gone by the time Albus Dumbledore walked up toHarry’s nook, carrying folded sheets of paper in his hand; real paper, withlines, not wizard’s parchment.“Is that—” Harry said.“From your father, and from your mother,” said the old wizard. Wordlessly, Dumbledore handed over the folded sheets, and wordlessly Harryaccepted them. The old wizard hesitated, then said quietly, “The DefenseProfessor has told me to restrain my counsel, and I thought the samething myself when given time to think. I have always taken too long tolearn the virtues of silence. But if I am mistaken, you need only say theword—”“You’re not mistaken,” Harry said. He looked down at the folded,lined papers, feeling the sickness in his gut that was how his body indicated a strong pessimistic prediction. His parents wouldn’t actuallydisown him, and there wasn’t much they could do to him (some partof himself was still afraid in a very visceral way of television privilegesbeing taken away, no matter how little sense that made now). But hehad stepped outside the role that parents would expect of children who,in their internal beliefs, were lower on the pecking order. It would bestupid to expect anything except complete indignant fury, all-out righteous rage, when you acted like that to someone who thought they weredominant over you.“After you read it,” the Headmaster said, “I believe that you shouldcome to the Great Hall at once, Harry. There is an announcement whichyou will wish to hear.”“I’m not interested in funerals—”“No. Not that. Please, Harry, come as soon as you are done reading,and do so without your Cloak. Will you?”“Yes.”The old wizard left.Harry had to force himself to open up the letter. The important thingwas keeping your vulnerable friends and relations out of harm’s way, itmight be a cliche but so far as Harry could tell the logic was valid. Damaged relationships could be repaired later.The first letter said, in script handwriting that required a careful focus for Harry to read,Son,No matter what you’ve read in books, keeping us out of harm’s wayis not as important as having adults who can help when you’re in trouble. You decided without giving us a word in edgewise that we’d abandonyou because of your ‘dark side’. The ghost of Shakespeare knows that I’veseen things in this last year that were not dreamt of in my philosophy—sometimes I wonder if your Mum isn’t just humoring me and the authorities took you away when I started thinking you were a magic-user—soI can’t deny that it’s possible you’ve managed to develop some… I’m notquite sure what to call it, but ‘dark side’ seems premature if we don’t knowwhat’s happening. Are you sure it’s not a burgeoning telepathic talent andyou’re just picking up on the minds of other wizards around you? Theirthoughts might seem evil to a child who grew up in a saner civilization.These are ungrounded speculations, I admit, but you shouldn’t jump toconclusions either.The two most important things I have to tell you are this. First, son, Ihave every confidence in your ability to stay on the Light Side of the Forceso long as you choose to, and I have every confidence that you will choose to.If there’s some evil spirit whispering horrible suggestions in your ears, justignore the suggestions. I do feel the need to emphasize that you should exercise special caution to ignore this evil spirit even if it is suggesting whatseem like wonderful creative ideas and I hope I do not need to remind youabout the Incident with the Science Project which would, I admit, make adeal more sense if you were struggling with demonic possession.The second thing I have to say is that you do not need to fear thatMum or I are going to abandon you because of your ‘dark side’. We maynot have expected you to gain magical powers or develop an affinity forblack magic, but we did expect you to become a teenager. Which, if youthink about it from your poor father’s perspective, is already a sufficientlyworrying prospect regarding a child who, by the age of nine, had beenparty to the summoning of a total of five fire engines. Children grow up.I won’t lie to you and say that you will feel as close to us at 20 as you donow. But your Mum and I will feel just as close to you when we are oldand grey and bothering the nursing-home robots. Children always growup and away from their parents, and the parents always follow them frombehind, offering helpful advice. Children grow up, and their personalitieschange, and they do things that their parents wish they would not do, andthey act disrespectfully toward their parents and have them hauled outof their magical schools, and the parents go on loving them anyway. Itis Nature’s way. Though in the event that you have not yet hit pubertyand your teenage years are proportionately worse than this, we reservethe right to reconsider this sentiment.No matter what is happening, remember that we love you and willalways love you no matter what. I don’t know if our love has any magicalpower under your rules, but if it does, don’t hesitate to call on it.With all of this said… Harry, what you did there is not acceptable. Ithink you know that. And I also know that it is not the time to lecture youon it. But you must write and tell us what is happening. I can understandvery well why you’d want us taken out of your school at once, and I knowwe can’t force you to do anything, but please, Harry, be reasonable andrealize how terrified we must be.I would like to tell you that you are absolutely forbidden to messaround with any magic that the adults around you consider the least bitunsafe, but for all I know, the teachers at your school are giving everyonelessons in advanced necromancy every Monday. Please, please exerciseas much caution as your situation permits, whatever your situation maybe. Despite your very hurried summary we don’t have the slightest ideawhat is happening and I hope that you will write us as much as you can.It is clear that you are, at least in some ways, growing up, and I will trynot to act like the children’s-book parent who only makes things worse—though I hope you appreciate how hard this is—and your Mum has saida number of frightening things to me about how wizardry stays secretand how I might get you into trouble by making waves. I cannot tellyou to avoid anything unsafe, because your school is unsafe and yourHeadmaster will not let you leave. I can’t tell you that you shouldn’t takeresponsibility for anything happening around you, because for all I knowthere are other children in trouble. But remember that it is not your moralresponsibility to protect any adults, their place is to protect you, and everygood adult would agree with that. Please write and tell us more as soonas you can.Both of us are desperate to help. If there is anything at all that we cando, please let us know at once. There is nothing which can happen to uswhich would be worse than learning that something had happened to you.Love,Dad.The last page said only,You promised me that you wouldn’t let magic take you away from me. Ididn’t raise you to be a boy who would break a promise to his Mum. Youmust come back safely, because you promised.Love,Mum.Slowly, Harry lowered the letters and began to walk towards the GreatHall. His hands were shaking, his whole body was shaking, and it seemedto be taking a very great deal of effort not to cry; which he knew wordlessly that he must not do. He hadn’t cried through all of the day. And hewouldn’t cry. Crying was the same as admitting defeat. And this wasn’tover. So he wouldn’t cry.The food served in the Great Hall that evening was plain that night, toastand butter and jam, water and orange juice, oatmeal and other simplefare, without dessert. Some students had worn simple black robes without their House colors. Others had still worn theirs. It should have been1541 *cause for argument, but there was instead a quietness, the sound of people eating without talking. It took two sides to make a debate, and one ofthe sides, this night, was not much interested in debating.Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall sat at the Head Table anddid not eat. She should have. Perhaps she would in a short while. But shecould not force herself to do it now.For a Gryffindor there was only one path. It had taken Minerva only ashort time to remember that, when after the Defense Professor’s urgingsher mind had stayed empty of clever plots to try. That was not a Gryffindor’s way; or perhaps she ought to say only that it was not her way, Albusdid seem to try his hand at plotting… and yet when she thought back ontheir history, there were no plots at the moment of crisis, no clevernessand games in the last resort. For Albus Dumbledore, as for her, the rule inextremis was to decide what was the right thing to do, and do it no matterthe cost to yourself. Even if it meant breaking your bounds, or changingyour role, or letting go of your picture of yourself. That was the last resortof Gryffindor.Through a side entrance of the Great Hall she saw Harry Potter quietlyslip in.It was time.Professor Minerva McGonagall rose from her chair, straightened theworn point on her hat, walked slowly to the lectern before the Head Table.The sounds in the Great Hall, already muted, fell away entirely as allstudents turned to look at her.“By now you have all heard,” she said, her voice not quite steady. ThatHermione Granger is dead. She didn’t say those words aloud, since they hadall heard. “Somehow, a troll was infiltrated into the castle Hogwarts without alarm from our ancient wards. Somehow this troll succeeded in injuring a student, without alarm from the wards until the point of her death.Investigations are underway to determine how this has occurred. TheBoard of Governors is meeting to determine how Hogwarts will respond.In due time justice shall be served. Meanwhile there is another matter ofjustice, which must be handled at once. George Weasley, Fred Weasley,please come forward to stand before us all.”The Weasley twins exchanged glances where they sat at the Gryffindor table, and then stood up and walked toward her, slowly, reluctantly;and Minerva realized then that the Weasley twins thought that they wereto be expelled.They honestly thought that she would expel them.That was what the picture of Professor McGonagall who lived in herhead had wrought.The Weasley twins walked over to the lectern, looking up at her withfaces that were frightened, but resolute; and she felt something in herheart break a little further.“I am not going to expel you,” she said, and was saddened further bythe surprised look on their faces. “Fred Weasley, George Weasley, turnand face your classmates, let them see you.”Still looking surprised, the Weasley twins did so.She drew up all the steel in her heart, and said what was right.“I am ashamed,” said Minerva McGonagall, “of the events of this day.I am ashamed that there were only two of you. Ashamed of what I havedone to Gryffindor. Of all the Houses, it should have been Gryffindor tohelp when Hermione Granger was in need, when Harry Potter called forthe brave to aid him. It was true, a seventh-year could have held backa mountain troll while searching for Miss Granger. And you should havebelieved that the Head of House Gryffindor,” her voice broke, “would havebelieved in you. If you disobeyed her to do what was right, in events shehad not foreseen. And the reason you did not believe this, is that I havenever shown it to you. I did not believe in you. I did not believe in thevirtues of Gryffindor itself. I tried to stamp out your defiance, instead oftraining your courage to wisdom. Whatever the Sorting Hat saw in methat led it to place me in Gryffindor, I have betrayed it. I have offered myresignation to the Headmaster as Deputy Headmistress and as the Headof House Gryffindor.”There were cries of shock and dismay, and not only from the GryffindorTable, as Harry’s heart froze within his chest. Harry needed to run forward, say something, he hadn’t meant for this to—Minerva took another breath, and continued. “However, the Headmasterhas declined to accept my resignation,” she said. “So I will continue toserve, and try to undo what I have wrought. Somehow I must find a wayto teach my students how to do what is right. Not what is safe, not whatis easy, not what we are told to do. If all I can teach you is to turn in youressays on time, there might as well not be a House Gryffindor. This roadwill be more difficult for me, and maybe for all of us. But I know now thatbefore I was only taking the easy path.”She stepped down from the lectern, moved down to where theWeasley twins stood.“Fred Weasley, George Weasley,” she said. “The two of you have notalways done what is right. The path of wisdom does not lie in flagrant andneedless defiance of authority. And yet today you proved to be the last ofour House to survive my mistakes. Because it was the right thing to do,you defied a threat of expulsion and risked your lives to face a mountaintroll. For your astounding courage that honors your House to have you, Iaward each of you two hundred points for Gryffindor.”Again the look of shock on their faces, again the pain like a knifethrough her heart.She turned to face the other students.“I will not award any points to Ravenclaw,” she said. “I suspect thatMr. Potter would not want them. If I am wrong, he may correct me andtake as many House points as he pleases. But for whatever it is worth,Mr. Potter, I am,” her voice faltered, “I am sorry—”“Stop!” Harry screamed, and then, again, “Stop.” The word sticking in histhroat. “You don’t have to, Professor.” Something inside him was twisting, threatening to split him open, like a giant’s hands wrenching at himto tear him in half. “And, and you shouldn’t forget Susan Bones, and RonWeasley—they also helped, they should get House points too—”“Miss Bones and the young Weasley?” said Professor McGonagall.“Rubeus said nothing of that—what did they do?”“Miss Bones tried to stun Mr. Hagrid when he tried to stop me, andMr. Weasley shot Neville when Neville tried to stop me. They should bothget points, and, and so should Neville,” Harry hadn’t thought to imagine itbefore, the way Neville must be feeling now, but the instant he’d thought,he knew, “because Neville tried to do something, even if it wasn’t the rightthing, doing what’s right is the second lesson, you can start practicing thatafter you learn to do anything at all—”“Ten points to Hufflepuff, Miss Bones,” Professor McGonagall said,her voice breaking in the middle. “Ten points to Gryffindor, Ron Weasley,your family has done itself exceeding proud, this day. And ten points toHufflepuff for Neville Longbottom, for standing up to Mr. Potter and doing what he thought was right—”“You shouldn’t!” screamed a young voice from the Hufflepuff table, followed by a single choking sound.Harry looked there, and then quickly looked back at Professor McGonagall and said, as steadily as he could, “Neville’s right, actually, you can’taward literally zero points for the part where you get the action correct,that sends the wrong message too, but he was halfway there so it couldbe five points instead.”Professor McGonagall looked, for a moment, like she couldn’t thinkof what to say; but then her eyes went to Neville’s place at the table, andshe said, “As you wish, Mr. Potter. What is it, Miss Bones?”Harry looked and saw that Susan Bones had stepped forward, wiping at her own eyes, and the Hufflepuff girl said, “Actually—ProfessorMcGonagall—General Potter didn’t see it—but Captain Weasley and Iweren’t the only ones who tried to get in Mr. Hagrid’s way, after he ranout. Before some of the older students stopped us. But we managed toslow Mr. Hagrid down a minute, so General Potter could get away.”“You’ve got to give them points too,” said Ron Weasley from the Gryffindor table. “Or I won’t take any.”“Who else?” said Professor McGonagall, her voice a bit unsteady.Seven other children stood up.What was that our Slytherin side was saying about predicting nothing wouldever work? said Hufflepuff.Something in Harry cracked, so that he had to exert all his force tohold himself together.When all had been said, and all had been done, Minerva went to whereHarry Potter stood. Though it was not her greatest skill she cast a wardabout them to blur vision, and muffled sounds with another thought.“You, you didn’t have to—” said Harry Potter. “You shouldn’t havesaid—” He sounded like he was choking. “P-Professor, everything I saidto you was hurtful, and hateful, and wrong—”“I already knew that, Harry,” she said. “Even so, I wished to do better.”There was a feeling of lightness in her chest, much as one might experience after stepping off a cliff, when your legs no longer had to hold yourbody upright. She wasn’t sure she could do this, she did not know theway; and yet for the first time it seemed possible that Hogwarts wouldn’tbecome a sad ghost of its former self, when she became its Headmistress.Harry stared at her, then made a odd noise that sounded like it hadbeen forced from his throat, and covered his face in his hands.So she knelt down, and hugged him. It might go wrong, but it mightalso go right, and she would not let that uncertainty stop her; it was timeshe began to learn a Gryffindor’s courage, so that she could teach it inturn.“I had a sister once,” she whispered. Just that, and nothing more.Just to make sure, said some part of Harry, while the rest of him sobbedinto Professor McGonagall’s arms, this doesn’t mean we’ve accepted Hermione’s death, right?NO said all the rest of him, every part of his mind in unanimous agreement, warmth and cold and a hidden place of steel. Never, ever, forever.And an ancient wizard to whom that ward meant nothing gazed uponthem both, the witch and the weeping young wizard. Albus Dumbledorewas smiling with a strange sad look in his eyes, like someone who hastaken one more step toward a foreseen destination.The Defense Professor watched them both, the woman and the crying boy.His eyes were very cold, and very calculating.He did not think that this would be enough.It wasn’t until the next morning that it was discovered that HermioneGranger’s body was missing.The first meeting:t 6:07am on April 17th, 1992 the Sun was just rising above the horizon as seen from the castle Hogwarts, filtering in through drawncurtains in the Ravenclaw first-year boys’ dorm to provide a gentle light,red-orange for dawn and little-changed by the white fabric covering thewindows, not yet waking boys more accustomed to winter’s schedule.In one bed among many, Harry Potter slept the sleep of the just exhausted.Quietly the door opened.Quietly a figure walked across the floor.That figure came to Harry Potter’s bed.The figure laid a hand on the shoulder of the sleeping boy, who startedand shrieked.No others heard.“Mr. Potter,” the small man squeaked, “the Headmaster has requestedyour presence immediately.”Slowly the boy sat up in bed, his hands momentarily fiddling beneaththe covers. He’d expected to feel much worse, waking up this morning. Itfelt… wrong, that his brain functioned now, that his thoughts still moved,that he wasn’t incapacitated with weeping for at least a week. The boyknew that it wouldn’t have been an adaptive response, for brains to evolveto do that. His dark side, certainly, would not do that. Even so, it still feltwrong to be alive and lucid, this morning.But his resolution to revive Hermione Granger felt—sufficient, likehe was already doing the right thing, bent on the right path, and shewould be brought back, and that was all there was to it; grief would havebeen giving up. There was nothing left to decide, no ambiguity, no conflict to tear at him, and no need to remember what he’d seen—“I’ll get dressed,” Harry said.Professor Flitwick looked rather reluctant, but said in his high voice,“The Headmaster specified you were to be brought to his office directlyand without pause, Mr. Potter. I’m sorry.”Less than a minute later—Professor Flitwick had sent him straightto the Headmaster’s office through the Hogwarts internal Floo—Harryfound himself, still in his pajamas, facing Albus Dumbledore. The DeputyHeadmistress was also sitting in another chair, and the Potions Masterlurked nearby amid the weird devices, caught in a gaping yawn just asHarry had entered through the fireplace.“Harry,” the Headmaster said without preamble, “before I say what Imust say next, I tell you that Hermione Granger did truly die. The wardsrecorded it and informed me. The very stones spoke that a witch haddied. I tested her body where it lay and those were Hermione Granger’strue mortal remains, not any doll or likeness. There is no way known towizardry by which death may be undone. All this being said, HermioneGranger’s remains are now missing from the storeroom where they wereplaced, and where you guarded them. Did you take them, Harry Potter?”“No,” Harry said, narrowing his eyes. A glance showed him thatSeverus was watching him intently.Dumbledore’s gaze was also keen, though not unfriendly. “Is Hermione Granger’s body in your possession?”“No.”“Do you know where it is?”“No.”“Do you know who took it?”“No,” Harry said, then hesitated. “Besides the obvious probabilisticspeculations which are not based upon any specific knowledge of mine.”The old wizard nodded. “Do you know why it was taken?”“No. Besides the obvious speculations etcetera.”“What would those be?” Sharp the ancient eyes.“If the enemy can notice you running off to consult the Weasley twinsduring class after Hermione was arrested, and find out about that magicmap you said was stolen, then the enemy can wonder why I was guarding Hermione Granger’s body. My turn. Did you arrange for Hermione’sdeath in hopes of getting the money back from Lucius?”“What?” said Professor McGonagall.“No,” said the old wizard.“Did you know or suspect that Hermione Granger would die?”“I did not know. As for suspicions, I placed her in the most stronglydefended position I could, against Voldemort. I did not will her death,nor allow it, nor plan to benefit from it, Harry Potter. Now show me yourpouch.”“It’s in my trunk—” Harry began.“Severus,” said the old wizard, and the Potions Master moved forward.“Check his trunk as well, every compartment.”“My trunk has wards.”Severus Snape grinned mirthlessly and strode into the green flame.Dumbledore took out his long dark-grey wand and began to wave itclose around Harry’s hair, looking like a Muggle using a metal-detector.Before he had reached as far as Harry’s neck, Dumbledore stopped.“The gem upon your ring,” Dumbledore said. “It is no longer a cleardiamond. It is brown, the color of Hermione Granger’s eyes, and the colorof her hair.”A sudden tension filled the room.“That’s my father’s rock,” Harry said. “Transfigured the same as before. I just did it to remember Hermione—”“I must be sure. Take off that ring, Harry, and place it upon my desk.”Slowly, Harry did so, removing the gem and setting the ring off to theother side of the desk.Dumbledore pointed his wand at the gem and—A large, undistinguished grey rock jumped into the air from the forceof its sudden expansion, hit some invisible barrier in the air above, andthen fell with a loud crack upon the Headmaster’s desk,“There’s another half-hour of work for me, Transfiguring it again,”Harry said evenly.1551 *Dumbledore resumed his examination. Harry had to remove his leftshoe, and take off the toe-ring that was his emergency portkey if someone kidnapped him and took him outside the wards of Hogwarts (anddidn’t put up anti-Apparition, anti-portkey, anti-phoenix, and anti-timelooping wards, which Severus had warned Harry that any inner-circleDeath Eater would certainly do). It was verified that the magic radiatingfrom the toe-ring was indeed the magic of a portkey, and not the magicof a Transfiguration. The rest of Harry was deemed clear.Not long after, the Potions Master returned, bearing Harry’s pouch,and several other magical things which had been in Harry’s trunk, whichthe Headmaster also examined, one by one, even to all the items remaining within the healer’s kit.“Can I go now?” Harry said when it was all done, putting as much coldas he could into his voice. He took up his pouch, and began the processof feeding the grey rock into it. The empty ring went back on his finger.The old wizard breathed out, slipping his wand back into his sleeve.“I am sorry,” he said. “I had to know. Harry… the Dark Lord has takenHermione Granger’s remains, it seems. I cannot think of anything hewould gain thereby, except to send her corpse against you as an Inferius.Severus shall give you certain potions to keep about your person. Bewarned now, and be prepared for when you must do what must be done.”“Will the Inferius have Hermione’s mind?”“No—”“Then it’s not her. Can I go? At least to change out of my pyjamas.”“There is other news, but I shall be brief. The wards of Hogwartsrecord that no foreign creature has entered, and that it was the DefenseProfessor who killed Hermione Granger.”“Um,” Harry said.Thought 1: But I saw the troll kill Hermione.Thought 2: Professor Quirrell Memory-Charmed me and set up the scene thatDumbledore saw when he arrived.Thought 3: Professor Quirrell can’t do that, his magic can’t touch mine. I sawthat in Azkaban—Thought 4: Can I trust those memories?Thought 5: There was clearly some sort of debacle at Azkaban, we wouldn’thave needed a rocket if Professor Quirrell hadn’t fallen unconscious, and why’d hebe unconscious if not—Thought 6: Did I ever actually go to Azkaban at all?Thought 7: I clearly practiced controlling Dementors at some point before Iscared that Dementor in the Wizengamot. And that was in the newspapers.Thought 8: Am I accurately remembering the newspapers?“Um,” Harry said again. “That spell seriously ought to be Unforgiveable. You think Professor Quirrell could have Memory-Charmed—”“No. I went back through time and placed certain instruments torecord Hermione’s last battle, which I could not quite bear to watch inmy own person.” The old wizard looked very grim indeed. “Your guesswas right, Harry Potter. Voldemort sabotaged everything we gave Hermione to protect her. Her broomstick lay dead in her hands. Her invisibilitycloak did not conceal her. The troll walked in the sunlight unharmed; itwas no stray creature, but a weapon pure and aimed. And it was indeedthe troll who killed her, with strength alone, so that my wards and websto detect hostile magics went for naught. The Defense Professor nevercrossed her path.”Harry swallowed, shut his eyes, and thought. “So this was an attempted frame on Professor Quirrell. Somehow. It does seem to be theenemy’s modus operandi. Troll eats Hermione Granger, check the wards,oh look actually the Defense Professor did it, same as last year… no. No,that can’t be right.”“Why not, Mr. Potter?” said the Potions Master. “It seems obviousenough to me—”“That’s the problem.”The enemy is smart.Slowly the fog of sleep was drifting out of Harry’s mind, and after afull night’s sleep his brain could see the things which hadn’t been obviousthe day before.Under standard literary convention… the enemy wasn’t supposedto look over what you’d done, sabotage the magic items you’d handedout, and then send out a troll rendered undetectable by some means theheroes couldn’t figure out even after the fact, so that you might as wellhave not defended yourself at all. In a book, the point-of-view usuallystayed on the main characters. Having the enemy just bypass all the protagonists’ work, as a result of planning and actions taken out of literarysight, would be a diabolus ex machina, and dramatically unsatisfying.But in real life the enemy would think that they were the main character, and they would also be clever, and think things through in advance,even if you didn’t see them do it. That was why everything about this feltso disjointed, with parts unexplained and seemingly inexplicable. Howhad Lucius felt, when Harry had threatened Dumbledore with breakingAzkaban? How had the Aurors above Azkaban felt, seeing the broomstickrise up on a torch of fire?The enemy is smart.“The enemy knew perfectly well that you’d turn back time to checkwhat really happened to Hermione, especially since the troll getting intoHogwarts at all tells us that somebody can fool the wards.” Harry shuthis eyes, thinking harder, trying to put himself into the enemy’s shoes.Why would he, or his dark side, have done something like—“We’re meantto conclude that the enemy has control of what the wards tell us. Butthat’s actually something the enemy can only do with difficulty, or underspecial conditions; they’re trying to create a false appearance of omnipotence.” Like I would. “Later, hypothetically, the wards show Professor Sinistra killing someone. We think the wards are just being fooled again, butreally, Professor Sinistra was Legilimized and she did do it.”“Unless that is precisely what the Dark Lord expects us to think,” saidSeverus Snape, his brow furrowed in concentration. “In which case hedoes have control of the wards, and Professor Sinistra will be innocent.”“Does the Dark Lord really use plots with that many levels of meta—”“Yes,” said Dumbledore and Severus.Harry nodded distantly. “Then this could be a setup to either make usthink the wards are telling the truth when they’re lying, or a setup to makeus think the wards are lying when they’re telling the truth, depending onwhat level the enemy expects us to reason at. But if the enemy is planningto make us trust the wards—we would have trusted the wards anyway, ifwe’d been given no reason to distrust them. So there’s no need to go toall the work of framing Professor Quirrell in a way that we would realizewe were intended to discover, just to trick us into going meta—”“Not so,” said Dumbledore. “If Voldemort has not fully mastered thewards, then the wards had to believe that some Professor’s hand was atwork. Else they would have cried out at Miss Granger’s injury, and notonly upon her death.”Harry reached up a hand and rubbed at his brow, just beneath his hair.Okay, serious question. If the enemy is that smart, why the heck am I stillalive? Is it seriously that hard to poison someone, are there Charms and Potionsand bezoars which can cure me of literally anything that could be slipped into mybreakfast? Would the wards record it, trace the magic of the murderer?Could my scar contain the fragment of soul that’s keeping the Dark Lord anchored to the world, so he doesn’t want to kill me? Instead he’s trying to drive off allmy friends to weaken my spirit so he can take over my body? It’d explain the Parselmouth thing. The Sorting Hat might not be able to detect a lich-phylactery-thingy.Obvious problem 1, the Dark Lord is supposed to have made his lich-phylacterythingy in 1943 by killing whatshername and framing Mr. Hagrid. Obvious problem 2, there’s no such thing as souls.Though Dumbledore also thought that my blood was a key ingredient in aritual to restore the Dark Lord’s full strength, which would require keeping mealive until then… now there’s a cheery thought.“Well…” Harry said. “I’m sure of one thing.”“And that is?”“Neville needs to be taken out of Hogwarts now. He’s the obvious nexttarget and no first-year student can survive this level of offense. We’relucky Neville wasn’t assassinated yesterday evening, the enemy doesn’thave to wait until we’re finished mourning to make their next move.”Why didn’t the enemy strike while we were distracted?Dumbledore exchanged glances with Severus, and then with the suddenly tight expression of Professor McGonagall. “Harry,” said the old wizard, “if you send all your friends away yourself, that is just the same as ifVoldemort—”“I will be fine I can do without Neville for a couple of extra months it’snot like you were planning to make my friends stay here over the summerand that is just plain not sufficient justification to let him get killed! Professor McGonagall—”“I quite agree,” said the Scottish witch. She frowned. “I extremelyagree. I agree to the point where… I’m having some trouble figuring outhow to express this, Albus…”“To the point where you’re going to haul him out of there yourself,regardless of what anyone else says, because it’s no excuse to say you wereonly following orders if Neville gets killed?” Harry said.Professor McGonagall closed her eyes briefly. “Yes, but surely thereought to be some way to be responsible without threats of unilateral action.”The Headmaster sighed. “No need. Go, Minerva.”“Wait,” the Potions Master said, just as Professor McGonagall, moving rather swiftly, was taking a pinch of green dust from the Floo-vase.“We should not call attention to the boy, as the Headmaster called attention to the Weasley twins. It would be wiser, I think, if Mr. Longbottom’sgrandmother took him from Hogwarts. Let him stay in his CommonRoom for now; the Dark Lord does not seem able to act so openly.”There was another long exchange of glances among the four, and finally Harry nodded, followed by Professor McGonagall.“In that case,” said Harry, “I’m sure of one other thing.”“And that is?” said Dumbledore.“I very much need to visit the washroom, and I would also like tochange out of these pyjamas.”“By the way,” Harry said as he and the Headmaster emerged from Floointo the empty office of the Ravenclaw Head of House. “One last quickquestion I wanted to ask just you. That sword the Weasley twins pulledout of the Sorting Hat. That was the Sword of Gryffindor, wasn’t it?”The old wizard turned, face neutral. “What makes you think that,Harry?”“The Sorting Hat yelled Gryffindor! just before handing it out, thesword had a ruby pommel and gold letters on the blade, and the Latinscript said Nothing better. Just a hunch.”“Nihil supernum,” said the old wizard. “That is not quite what it means.”Harry nodded. “Mmhm. What’d you do with it?”“I retrieved it from where it fell, and placed it in a secure place,” theold wizard said. He gave Harry a stern look. “I hope you are not greedyfor it yourself, young Ravenclaw.”“Not at all, just want to make sure you’re not keeping it permanentlyfrom its rightful wielders. So the Weasley twins are the Heir of Gryffindor, then?”“The Heir of Gryffindor?” Dumbledore said, looking surprised. Thenthe old wizard smiled, blue eyes twinkling brightly. “Ah, Harry, SalazarSlytherin may have built a Chamber of Secrets into Hogwarts, but GodricGryffindor was not much given to such extravagances. We have seen onlythat Godric left his Sword to the defense of Hogwarts, if a worthy studentever faced a foe they could not defeat alone.”“That’s not the same as saying no. Don’t think I didn’t notice that youdidn’t actually say no.”“I did not live in those years, Harry, and I do not know all that GodricGryffindor may or may not have done—”“Do you in fact assign greater than fifty percent subjective probabilitythat there is something like a Heir of Gryffindor and one or both Weasleytwins are it. Yes or no, evasion means yes. You’re not going to succeed indistracting me, no matter how much I have to go to the bathroom.”The old wizard sighed. “Yes, Fred and George Weasley are the Heir ofGryffindor. I beg you not to speak of it to them, not yet.”Harry nodded, and turned to go. “I’m surprised,” Harry said. “I reada little about Godric Gryffindor’s historical life. The Weasley twins are…well, they’re awesome in various ways, but they don’t seem much like theGodric in the history books.”“Only a man exceedingly proud and vain,” Dumbledore said quietly,as he turned back to the Floo roaring up again with green flames, “wouldbelieve that his heir should be like himself, rather than like who he wishedthat he could be.”The Headmaster stepped into green fire, and was gone.The second meeting (in a small cubby off the Hufflepuff CommonRoom):Neville Longbottom’s face was drawn up in anguish, as he spoke withno one to hear, to the empty air.“Seriously,” the empty air said back to him. “I’m wearing an invisibility cloak with extra anti-detection charms just to walk through the hallways because I don’t want to be killed. My parents would have me out ofHogwarts in an instant if the Headmaster allowed it. Neville, your gettingthe heck out of Hogwarts is common sense, it has nothing to do with—”“I betrayed you, General,” Neville said, his voice around as hollow asany normal eleven-year-old boy could reasonably manage. “I didn’t evendo it the Chaotic way. I conformed to authority and tried to make youconform to authority too. What’s that you always say, about how in theChaos Legion, a soldier who can only obey orders is useless?”“Neville,” the empty air said firmly. The pressure of two hands, beneath thin cloth, came firmly to bear on Neville’s shoulders; and the voicemoved closer to him. “You weren’t blindly obeying authority, you weretrying to protect me. It’s true that in this chaotic world, soldiers who canonly follow rules and regulations are worthless. However, soldiers whofollow rules for the sake of protecting their friends are—”“Slightly better than worthless?” Neville said bitterly.“Significantly better than worthless. Neville, you made an error ofjudgment. It cost me around six seconds. Now it could be that Hermione’s injuries were just barely fatal, but even then, I don’t think sixseconds was actually enough time for the troll to take an extra bite ofHermione. In the counterfactual world where you didn’t step in frontof me, Hermione still died. Now, I could stand here listing out the firstdozen ways that Hermione would be alive if I hadn’t been stupid—”“You? You ran right out after her. I’m the one who tried to stop you.It’s my fault if it’s anyone’s,” Neville said bitterly.The empty air went silent at this for a while.“Wow,” the empty air finally said. “Wow. That puts a pretty differentperspective on things, I have to say. I’m going to remember this the nexttime I feel an impulse to blame myself for something. Neville, the termin the literature for this is ‘egocentric bias’, it means that you experienceeverything about your own life but you don’t get to experience everythingelse that happens in the world. There was way, way more going on thanyou running in front of me. You’re going to spend weeks rememberingthat thing you did there for six seconds, I can tell, but nobody else is goingto bother thinking about it. Other people spend a lot less time thinkingabout your past mistakes than you do, just because you’re not the centerof their worlds. I guarantee to you that nobody except you has even considered blaming Neville Longbottom for what happened to Hermione. Notfor a fraction of a second. You are being, if you will pardon the phrase, asilly-dilly. Now shut up and say goodbye.”“I don’t want to say goodbye,” Neville said. His voice was trembling,but he managed not to cry. “I want to stay here and fight with youagainst—against whatever’s happening.”The empty air moved closer to him, and embraced him in a hug, andHarry Potter’s voice whispered, “Tough luck.”The third meeting(10:31am, April 17th 1992)pring had begun, the late-morning air still crisp with the leavingsof winter. Daffodils had bloomed amid the sprouting grass of theforest, the gentle yellow petals with their golden hearts dangling limplyfrom their dead, grayed stems, wounded or killed by one of the suddenfrosts that you often saw in April. In the Forbidden Forest there wouldbe stranger lifeforms, centaurs and unicorns at the least, and Harry hadheard allegations of werewolves. Though from what Harry had read ofreal-life werewolves, that did not make the slightest bit of sense.Harry didn’t venture anywhere near the border of the Forbidden Forest, since there was no reason to take the risk. He walked invisibly amongthe more ordinary life-forms of the permitted woods, wand in hand, abroomstick strapped to his back for easier access, just in case. He wasnot actually afraid; Harry thought it odd that he didn’t feel afraid. Thestate of constant vigilance, readiness for fight or flight, failed to feel burdensome or even abnormal.On the edges of the permitted woods Harry walked, his feet neverstraying near the beaten path where he might be more easily found, neverleaving sight of Hogwarts’s windows. Harry had set the alarm upon hismechanical watch to tell him when it was lunchtime, since he couldn’tactually look at his wrist, being invisible and all that. It raised the question of how his eyeglasses worked while he was wearing the Cloak. Forthat matter the Law of the Excluded Middle seemed to imply that either1561 *the rhodopsin complexes in his retina were absorbing photons and transducing them to neural spikes, or alternatively, those photons were goingstraight through his body and out the other side, but not both. It reallydid seem increasingly likely that invisibility cloaks let you see outwardwhile being invisible yourself because, on some fundamental level, thatwas how the caster had—not wanted—but implicitly believed—that invisibility should work.Whereupon you had to wonder whether anyone had tried Confunding or Legilimizing someone into implicitly and matter-of-factly believing that Fixus Everythingus ought to be an easy first-year Charm, and thentrying to invent it.Or maybe find a worthy Muggleborn in a country that didn’t identifyMuggleborn children, and tell them some extensive lies, fake up a surrounding story and corresponding evidence, so that, from the very beginning, they’d have a different idea of what magic could do. Thoughapparently they’d still have to learn a number of previous Charms beforethey became capable of inventing their own…It might not work. Surely there’d been some organically insane wizards who’d truly believed in their own possibility of godhood, and yet hadfailed to become god. But even the insane had probably believed the ascension spell ought to be some grandiose dramatic ritual and not something you did with a carefully composed twitch of your wand and the incantation Becomus Goddus.Harry was already pretty sure it wouldn’t be that easy. But then thequestion was, why not? What pattern had his brain learned? Could thereason be predicted in advance?A slight fringe of apprehension crept through Harry then, a tinge ofworry, as he contemplated this question. The nameless concern sharpened, grew greater—Professor Quirrell?“Mr. Potter,” a soft voice called from behind him.Harry spun, his hand going to the Time-Turner beneath his cloak;again the principle of being ready to flee upon an instant’s notice felt onlyordinary.Slowly, palms empty and turned outward, Professor Quirrell waswalking towards him within the forests’ outskirts, coming from thegeneral direction of the Hogwarts castle.“Mr. Potter,” Professor Quirrell said again. “I know that you’re here.You know that I know that you’re here. I must speak to you.”Still Harry said nothing. Professor Quirrell hadn’t actually said whatthis was about, and Harry’s sunlit morning walk about the forest edgehad produced a mood of silence within him.Professor Quirrell took a small step to the left, a step forward, anotherto the right. He tilted his head with a look of calculation, and then hewalked almost directly towards where Harry stood, halted a few paces offwith the sense of doom enflamed to the height of bearability.“Are you still resolved upon your course?” Professor Quirrell said.“The same course you spoke of yesterday?”Again Harry did not reply.Professor Quirrell sighed. “There is much I have done for you,” theman said. “Whatever else you may wonder of me, you cannot deny that.I am calling in some of the debt. Talk to me, Mr. Potter.”I don’t feel like doing this right now, Harry thought; then: Oh, right.Two hours later, after Harry had spun the Time-Turner once, noted downthe exact time and memorized his exact location, spent another hourwalking, went inside and told Professor McGonagall that he was currently talking to the Defense Professor in the woods outside Hogwarts(just in case anything happened to him), walked for a further hour, thenreturned to his original location exactly one hour after he’d left and spunthe Time-Turner again—“What was that?” Professor Quirrell said, blinking. “Did you just—”“Nothing important,” Harry said without pulling back the hood of hisinvisibility cloak, or taking his hand from his Time-Turner. “Yes, I’m stillresolved. To be honest, I’m thinking I shouldn’t have said anything.”Professor Quirrell inclined his head. “A sentiment which shall serveyou well in life. Is there anything which is liable to change your mind?”“Professor, if I already knew about the existence of an argument whichwould change my decision—”“True, for the likes of us. But you would be surprised how often someone knows what they are waiting to hear, yet must wait to hear it said.”Professor Quirrell shook his head. “To put this in your terms… there is atrue fact, known to me but not to you, of which I would like to convinceyou, Mr. Potter.”Harry’s eyebrows rose, though he realized in the next moment thatProfessor Quirrell couldn’t see it. “That’s in my terms, all right. Goahead.”“The intention you have formed is far more dangerous than you realize.”Replying to this surprising statement did not take much thought onHarry’s part. “Define dangerous, and tell me what you think you knowand how you think you know it.”“Sometimes,” said Professor Quirrell, “telling someone about a danger can cause them to walk directly into it. I have no intention of havingthat happen this time. Do you expect me to tell you exactly what you mustnot do? Exactly why I am afraid?” The man shook his head. “If you werewizardborn, Mr. Potter, you would know to take it seriously, when a powerful magus tells you only to beware.”It would have been a lie to say that Harry was not annoyed, but he alsowasn’t an idiot; so Harry said merely, “Is there anything you can tell me?”Carefully, Professor Quirrell seated himself upon the grass, andtook out his wand, his hand assuming a position that Harry recognized.Harry’s breath caught.“This is the last time that I shall be able to do this for you,” Professor Quirrell said quietly. Then the man began to speak words that werestrange, of no language Harry could recognize, intonation that seemednot quite human, words which seemed to slip from Harry’s memory evenas he tried to grasp them, exiting from his mind as quickly as they entered.The spell took effect more slowly, this time. The trees seemed todarken, branches and leaves staining, as though seen through perfectsunglasses that faded and attenuated light without distorting it. Theblue bowl of the sky receded, the horizon which Harry’s brain falselyassigned a finite distance pulling back as it turned gray, and darker gray.The clouds became translucent, transparent, wisping away to let thedarkness shine through.The forest shaded, faded, abated into blackness.The great sky river became visible once again, as Harry’s eyes adjusted, became able to see the largest object which human eyes couldever behold as more than a point, the surrounding Milky Way.And the stars, piercingly bright and yet remote, out of a great depth.Professor Quirrell breathed deeply. Then he raised his wand again(just barely visible, in the starlight without sun or moon) and tapped himself on the head with a sound like an egg cracking.The Defense Professor also faded away, became likewise invisible.A tiny disk of grass, illuminated by not much light at all, drifted unoccupied within empty space.Neither of them spoke for a time. Harry was content to look at thestars, undistracted even by his own body. Whatever Professor Quirrellhad called him here to say, it would be said in due time.In due time, a voice spoke.“There is no war here,” said a soft voice emanating from within theemptiness. “No conflict and battle, no politics and betrayal, no death andno life. That is all for the folly of men. The stars are above such foolishness, untouched by it. Here there is peace, and silence eternal. So I oncethought.”Harry turned to look at where the voice originated, and saw only stars.“So you once thought?” Harry said, when no other words seemed tobe forthcoming.“There is nothing above the folly of men,” whispered the voice fromthe emptiness. “There is nothing beyond the destructive powers of sufficiently intelligent idiocy, not even the stars themselves. I went to a greatdeal of trouble to make a certain golden plaque last forever. I would notlike to see it destroyed by human folly.”Again Harry’s eyes reflexively darted toward where the voice shouldhave been, again saw only emptiness. “I think I can reassure you onthat score, Professor. Nuclear weapons don’t have a fireball extendingout for… how far away is Pioneer 11? Somewhere around a billion kilometers, maybe? Muggles talk about nuclear weapons destroying theworld, but what they actually mean is lightly warming up some of Earth’ssurface. The Sun is a giant fusion reaction and it doesn’t vaporize distantspace probes. The worst-case scenario for nuclear war wouldn’t evencome close to destroying the Solar System, not that this is much of aconsolation.”“True while we speak of Muggles,” said the soft voice amid starlight.“But what do Muggles know of true power? It is not they who frighten menow. It is you.”“Professor,” Harry said carefully, “while I have to admit I’ve rolled afew critical failures in my life, there’s a bit of distance between that andmissing a saving throw so hard that the Pioneer 11 probe gets caught inthe blast radius. There’s no realistic way to do that without blowing upthe Sun. And before you ask, our Sun is a main-sequence G-type star,it can’t explode. Any energy input would just increase the volume of thehydrogen plasma, the Sun doesn’t have a degenerate core that could bedetonated. The Sun doesn’t have enough mass to go supernova, even atthe end of its lifespan.”“Such amazing things the Muggles have learned,” the other voice murmured. “How stars live, how they are preserved from death, how they die.And they never wonder if such knowledge might be dangerous.”“In all frankness, Professor, that particular thought has never occurred to me either.”“You are Muggleborn. I speak not of blood, I speak of how you spentyour childhood years. There is a freedom of thought in that, true. Butthere is also wisdom in the caution of wizardkind. It has been three hundred and twenty-three years since the magical territories of Sicily were ruined by one man’s folly. Such incidents were more common in the yearswhen Hogwarts was raised. Commoner still, in the aftertime of Merlin.Of the time before Merlin, little remains to study.”“There’s around thirty orders of magnitude of difference betweenthat and blowing up the Sun,” Harry observed, then caught himself. “Butthat’s a pointless quibble, sorry, blowing up a country would also be bad,I agree. In any case, Professor, I don’t plan on doing anything like that.”“Your choice is not required, Mr. Potter. If you had read more wizardborn novels and fewer Muggle stories, you would know. In seriousliterature the wizard whose foolishness threatens to unleash the Shambling Bone-Men will not be deliberately bent on such a goal, that is for children’s books. This truly dangerous wizard shall perhaps be bent on someproject of which he anticipates great renown, and the certain prospect oflosing that renown and living out his life in obscurity will seem to himmore vivid than the unknown prospect of destroying his country. Or heshall have promised success to one he cannot bear to disappoint. Perhapshe has children in debt. There is much literary wisdom in those stories.It is born of harsh experience and cities of ash. The most likely prospectfor disaster is a powerful wizard who, for whatever reason, cannot bringhimself to halt as warning signs appear. Though he may speak much andloudly of caution, he will not be able to bring himself actually to halt. Iwonder, Mr. Potter, have you thought of trying anything which Hermione Granger herself would have told you not to do?”“All right, point taken,” said Harry. “Professor, I am well aware that ifI save Hermione at the price of two other people’s lives, I’ve lost on totalpoints from a utilitarian standpoint. I am extremely aware that Hermionewould not want me to risk destroying a whole country just to save her.That’s just common sense.”“Child who destroys Dementors,” said that soft voice, “if it were onlyone country I feared you might ruin, I would be less concerned. I did notat first credit that your knowledge of Muggle science and Muggle practices would be a source of great power. I now credit it more. I am, incomplete sincerity, concerned for the safety of that golden plaque.”“Well, if science fiction has taught me anything,” said Harry, “it’staught me that destroying the Solar System is not morally acceptable,especially if you do it before humanity has colonized any other starsystems.”“Then will you give up this—”“No,” Harry said without even thinking before he opened his mouth.After a moment, he added, “But I do understand what you’re trying to tellme.”Silence. The stars had not shifted, not even as they would have in anEarthly night sky, over time.A very slight rustle, as of someone shifting their body. Harry realizedthat he had been standing for a while in the same position, and droppeddown to the almost unseeable circle of grass that still stayed beneath him,careful not to touch the edges of the spell.“Tell me this,” said the soft voice. “Why does that girl matter to you somuch?”“Because she is my friend.”“In the English language as it is customarily used, Mr. Potter, theword ‘friend’ is not associated with a desperate effort to raise the dead.Are you under the impression that she is your true love, or some such?”“Oh, not you too,” Harry said wearily. “Not you of all people, Professor.Fine, we’re best friends, but that’s all, okay? That’s enough. Friends don’tlet friends stay dead.”“Ordinary folk do not do as much, for those they call friends.” Thevoice sounded more distant now, abstracted. “Not even for those they saythey love. Their companions die, and they do not go in search of powerto resurrect them.”Harry couldn’t help himself. He looked over again, despite knowingit would be futile, and saw only more stars. “Let me guess, from this youdeduce that… people don’t actually care as much about their friends asthey pretend.”A brief laugh. “They would scarcely pretend to care less.”“They care, Professor, and not just for their true loves. Soldiers throwthemselves on grenades to save their friends, mothers run into burninghouses to save their children. But if you’re a Muggle you don’t thinkthere’s any such thing as magic to bring someone back to life. And normal wizards don’t… think outside the box like that. I mean, most wizardsaren’t searching for power to make themselves immortal. Does that provethey don’t care about their own lives?”“As you say, Mr. Potter. Certainly I myself would consider their livespointless and without a shred of value. Perhaps, somewhere in their hidden hearts, they also believe that my opinion of them is the correct one.”Harry shook his head, and then, in annoyance, cast back the hood ofhis Cloak, and shook his head again. “That seems like a rather contrivedview of the world, Professor,” said the dim-lit head of a boy, floating unsupported on a circle of dark grass amid stars. “Trying to invent a resurrection spell just isn’t something normal people would think of, so youcan’t deduce anything from their not taking the option.”A moment later, the dim-lit outline of a man sitting on the circle ofgrass was visible as well.“If they truly cared about their supposed loved ones,” the Defense Professor said softly, “they would think of it, would they not?”“Brains don’t work that way. They don’t suddenly supercharge whenthe stakes go up—or when they do, it’s within hard limits. I couldn’t calculate the thousandth digit of pi if someone’s life depended on it.”The dim-lit head inclined. “But there is another possible explanation,Mr. Potter. It is that people play the role of friendship. They do just asmuch as that role requires of them, and no more. The thought occursto me that perhaps the difference between you and them is not that youcare more than they do. Why would you have been born with such unusually strong emotions of friendship, that you alone among wizardkindare driven to resurrect Hermione Granger after her death? No, the mostlikely difference is not that you care more. It is that, being a more logicalcreature than they, you alone have thought that playing the role of Friendwould require this of you.”Harry stared out at the stars. He would have been lying if he’d claimednot to be shaken. “That… can’t be true, Professor. I could name a dozen examples in Muggle novels of people driven to resurrect their dead friends.The authors of those stories clearly understood exactly how I feel aboutHermione. Though you wouldn’t have read them, I guess… maybe Orpheus and Eurydice? I didn’t actually read that one but I know what’s init.”“Such tales are also told among wizardkind. There is the story of theElric brothers. The tale of Dora Kent, who was protected by her son Saul.There is Ronald Mallett and his doomed challenge to Time. In Sicily before its fall, the drama of Precia Testarossa. In Nippon they tell of AkemiHomura and her lost love. What these stories have in common, Mr. Potter, is that they are all fiction. Real-life wizards do not attempt the same,even though the notion is clearly not beyond their imagination.”“Because they don’t think they can!” Harry’s voice rose.“Shall we go and tell the good Professor McGonagall about your intention to find a way to resurrect Miss Granger, and see what she thinks ofit? Perhaps it has simply never occurred to her to consider that option…Ah, but you hesitate. You already know her answer, Mr. Potter. Do youknow why you know it?” You could hear the cold smile in the voice. “Alovely technique, that. Thank you for teaching it to me.”Harry was aware of the tension that had developed in his face, hiswords came out as though bitten off. “Professor McGonagall has notgrown up with the Muggle concept of the increasing power of science,and nobody’s ever told her that when a friend’s life is at stake is a timewhen you need to think very rationally—”The Defense Professor’s voice was also rising. “The TransfigurationProfessor is reading from a script, Mr. Potter! That script calls for her tomourn and grieve, that all may know how much she cared. Ordinarypeople react poorly if you suggest that they go off-script. As you alreadyknew!”“That’s funny, I could have sworn I saw Professor McGonagall goingoff-script at dinner yesterday. If I saw her go off-script another ten timesI might actually try to talk to her about resurrecting Hermione, but rightnow she’s new to that and needs practice. In the end, Professor, whatyou’re trying to explain away by calling love and friendship and everything else a lie is just human beings not knowing any better.”The Defense Professor’s voice rose in pitch. “If it were you who hadbeen killed by that troll, it would not even occur to Hermione Granger todo as you are doing for her! It would not occur to Draco Malfoy, nor toNeville Longbottom, nor to McGonagall or any of your precious friends!There is not one person in this world who would return to you the carethat you are showing her! So why? Why do it, Mr. Potter?” There was astrange, wild desperation in that voice. “Why be the only one in the worldwho goes to such lengths to keep up the pretense, when none of them willever do the same for you?”“I believe you are factually mistaken, Professor,” Harry returnedevenly. “About a number of things, in fact. At the very least, your modelof my emotions is flawed. Because you don’t understand me the tiniestbit, if you think that it would stop me if everything you said was true. Everything in the world has to start somewhere, every event that happenshas to happen for a first time. Life on Earth had to start with some littleself-replicating molecule in a pool of mud. And if I were the first personin the world, no—”Harry’s hand swept out, to indicate the terribly distant points of light.“—if I were the first person in the universe who ever really cared aboutsomeone else, which I’m not by the way, then I’d be honored to be thatperson, and I’d try to do it justice.”There was a long silence.“You truly do care about that girl,” the man’s dim outline said softly.“You care about her in the way that none of them are capable of caringfor their own lives, let alone each other.” The Defense Professor’s voicehad become strange, filled with some indecipherable emotion. “I do notunderstand it, but I know the lengths you will go to because of it. You willchallenge death itself, for her. Nothing will sway you from that.”“I care enough to make an actual effort,” Harry said quietly. “Yes, thatis correct.”The starlight slowly began to fracture, the world shining through thecracks; slashes through the night showing treetrunks and leaves glowing in the sunlight. Harry raised a hand, blinking hard, as the returningbrightness smashed into his dark-adjusted eyes; and his eyes automatically went to the Defense Professor, just in case an attack occurred whilehe was blinded.When all the stars had gone and only daylight remained, ProfessorQuirrell was still sitting on the grass. “Well, Mr. Potter,” he said in hisnormal voice, “if that is so, then I shall give you what help I can, while Ican.”“You’ll what?” Harry said involuntarily.1571 *“My offer as I made it yesterday still stands. Ask and I will answer.Show me the same science books you deemed suitable for Mr. Malfoy, andI shall look them over and tell you what comes to mind. Don’t look sosurprised, Mr. Potter, I would hardly leave you to your own devices.”Harry stared, tear ducts still watering from the sudden light.Professor Quirrell looked back at him. Something strange glinted inthe pale eyes. “I have done what I can, and now I fear I must take myleave of you. Good—” and the Defense Professor hesitated. “Good day,Mr. Potter.”“Good—” Harry began.The man sitting on the grass fell over, his head impacting the groundwith a light thud. At the same time the sense of doom diminished sosharply that Harry leapt to his feet, his heart suddenly in his throat.But the figure on the ground slowly pushed back up to a crawling position. Turned to look at Harry, eyes empty, mouth slack. Tried to stand,fell back to the ground.Harry took a step forward, sheer instinct telling him to offer a hand,although that was incorrect; the apprehension that rose up in him, however faint, spoke of continued danger.But the fallen figure flinched away from Harry, and then slowly begancrawl to away from him, in the general direction of the distant castle.The boy standing amid the forest gazed after.The fourth meeting:(4:38pm, April 17th, 1992)he man wearing the worn, warm coat, with three faint scars etchedforever into his cheek, observed Harry Potter as closely as he couldwhile the boy looked around politely at the rows of cottages. For someone whose best friend had died yesterday, Harry Potter seemed strangelycomposed, though not in any way reminiscent of unfeelingness, or normality. I don’t wish to talk about that, the boy had said, with you or anyone.Saying ‘wish’ and not ‘want’, as though to emphasize that he was ableto use grownup words and make grownup decisions. There had beenonly one thing Remus Lupin had thought of that might help, after he’dreceived the owls from Professor McGonagall and that strange man Quirinus Quirrell.“There’s a lot of empty houses,” the boy said, glancing around again.Godric’s Hollow had changed, in the decade since Remus Lupinhad been a frequent visitor. Many of the old, peaked cottages lookeddeserted, with green leafy vines growing across their windows and theirdoors. Britain had contracted noticeably, in the aftermath of the Wizarding War, having lost not only the dead but the fled. Godric’s Hollow hadbeen hard-hit. And afterward still more families had moved elsewhere, toHogsmeade or magical London, the deserted houses too uncomfortablea reminder.Others had remained. Godric’s Hollow was older than Hogwarts,older than Godric Gryffindor whose name it had taken, and there werefamilies which would reside here until the end of the world and its magic.The Potters had been one such family, and would be again, if the lastPotter so chose.Remus Lupin tried to explain all that, simplifying it as best he couldfor the young boy. The Ravenclaw nodded thoughtfully and said nothing,as though he had understood it all without need of questions. Perhapsthat was so; the child of James Potter and Lily Evans, the Head Boy andHead Girl of Hogwarts, would hardly be stupid. The child had certainlyseemed highly intelligent, for the little time that they had spoken in January, though at that time Remus had done most of the talking.(There was also that business with the Wizengamot which Remushad heard rumors about, but Remus didn’t believe a single word of that,any more than he’d believed it about James betrothing his son to Molly’syoungest.)“There’s the monument,” Remus said, pointing ahead of them.Harry walked beside Mr. Lupin toward the black marble obelisk, thinking silently. It seemed to Harry that this adventure was essentially misguided; he had no use for grief counseling, that was not Harry’s chosenpath. So far as Harry was concerned, the five stages of grief were Rage,Remorse, Resolve, Research, and Resurrection. (Not that the usual ‘fivestages of grief’ had any experimental evidence whatsoever that Harry hadever heard about.) But Mr. Lupin had seemed too sincere to refuse; andvisiting James and Lily’s home was something Harry felt he ought notto turn down. So Harry walked, feeling oddly detached; walking silentlythrough a play whose script he was not interested in reading.Harry had been told that he wasn’t to wear the Cloak of Invisibility forthis journey, so that Mr. Lupin could keep track of him.Harry was morally certain that Dumbledore, or both Dumbledore andMad-Eye Moody, were following them invisibly to see if anyone tried forthe bait. There was no way Harry would have been let out of Hogwartswith only Remus Lupin for a guard. Harry didn’t expect anything to happen, though. He’d seen nothing to contradict the hypothesis that all thedanger centered on Hogwarts and only Hogwarts.As the two of them walked closer toward the center of town, the marble obelisk transformed into—Harry drew in a breath. He’d been expecting a heroic pose of JamesPotter with wand leveled against Lord Voldemort, and Lily Potter witharms outstretched in front of the crib.Instead there was a man with untidy hair and glasses, and a womanwith her hair let down and a baby in her arms, and that was all.“It looks very… normal,” Harry said, feeling an odd catch in his throat.“Madam Longbottom and Professor Dumbledore put their foot downhard,” said Mr. Lupin, who was looking more at Harry than at the monument. “They said that the Potters should be remembered as they hadlived, not as they had died.”Harry looked at the statue, thinking. Very strange, to see himself asa baby of stone, with no scar upon his forehead. It was a glimpse at analternate universe, one where Harry James Potter (no Evans-Verres tohis name) became an intelligent but ordinary wizarding scholar, maybeSorted into Gryffindor like his parents. A Harry Potter who grew up aproper young wizard, knowing little of science for all that his mother wasMuggleborn. Ultimately changing… not much. James and Lily wouldn’thave raised their son with what Professor Quirrell would have called ambition and what Professor Verres-Evans would have called the common endeavor. His birth parents would have loved him very much, and that wouldnot have been much help to anyone in the world except Harry. If someonehad undone their death—“You were their friend,” Harry said, turning to look at Lupin. “For along time, since you were children.”Mr. Lupin nodded silently.Professor Quirrell’s voice resounded in Harry’s approximate memory:The most likely difference is not that you care more. Rather it is that, being amore logical creature than they, only you are aware that the role of Friend oughtto require this of you…“When Lily and James died,” Harry said, “did you think at all ofwhether there might be some magical way to get them back? Like Orpheus and Eurydice? Or the, what was it, Elrin brothers?”“There is no magic which can undo death,” Mr. Lupin said quietly.“There are some mysteries which wizardry cannot touch.”“Did you do a mental check of what you thought you knew, how youthought you knew it, and how high the probability was of that conclusion?”“What?” said Mr. Lupin. “Could you repeat that, Harry?”“I’m saying, did you think about it anyway?”Mr. Lupin shook his head.“Why not?”“Because it was already done, and over,” Remus Lupin said gently.“Because wherever James and Lily are now, they would wish me to act forthe sake of the living, not the dead.”Harry nodded silently. He’d been pretty sure of the answer to thatquestion before he’d asked. He’d already read that script. But he’d askedanyway, just in case Mr. Lupin had spent a week obsessing about it, because Harry could have been wrong.The soft voice of the Defense Professor seemed to speak in Harry’smind. Surely, if Lupin truly cared, he would not need special instruction for something as simple as thinking for five minutes before giving up…Yes, he would, Harry answered the mental voice. Human beings wouldn’tsuddenly obtain a skill like that just because they cared. I learned about it becauseI’d read library books, produced by a huge scientific edifice—And that other part of Harry said, in that soft voice, But there is alsoanother hypothesis, Mr. Potter, and it fits the data in a much less complicatedway.No it doesn’t! How would people even know what to pretend, if nobody hadever cared?They don’t know. That is what you observe.The two of them walked onward toward a certain house, past a longrow of occupied wizard cottages and other cottages overgrown withvines.Coming finally to the house with half its top blown off, and greenleaves growing over into the inside; behind a shoulder-high wild-growinghedge lining the sidewalk, and a narrow metal gate (Mr. Hagrid had probably stepped right over it, being unable to fit through). The gap in the roofwas like a giant mouth had taken a circular bite from the house, leavingspines of wood, what had maybe been support beams, sticking out. Tothe right side a single chimney still stood upright, uneaten by the giantbite, but leaning dangerously without its former support. Windows wereshattered. Where there should have been a front door were only splintersof wood.To this place Lord Voldemort had come, silently, making less noise thanthe dead leaves slithering along the pavement…Remus Lupin put a hand upon Harry’s shoulder. “Touch the gate,”Mr. Lupin urged.Harry reached out a hand and did so.Like a fast-growing flower a sign burst from the tangled weeds in theground behind the gate, a wooden sign with golden letters, and it said:On this spot, on the night of 31 October 1981,Lily and James Potter lost their lives.They were survived by their son, Harry Potter,the only wizard ever to withstand the Killing Curse,the Boy-Who-Lived, who broke You-Know-Who’s power.This house has been left in its ruined state,as a monument to the Potters,as a reminder of their sacrifice.In a blank space below the golden letters were written other messages,dozens of them, magical ink that rose to the surface and gleamed brightlyenough to be read before fading and giving way to other messages.So my Gideon is avenged.Thank you, Harry Potter. Fare well wherever you are.We will always be in the Potters’ debt.Oh James, oh Lily, I am sorry.I hope you’re alive, Harry Potter.There is always a price.I wish our last words had been kinder, James. I’m sorry.There is always a dawn after the night.Rest well, Lily.Bless you, Boy-Who-Lived. You were our miracle.“I guess—” Harry said. “I guess that’s what people do—instead of trying to make it better—” Harry stopped. The thought seemed unworthy ofthis place. He looked up, and saw Remus Lupin gazing at him with a lookso gentle that Harry wrenched his eyes away to the blasted and brokenroof.You were our miracle. Harry had always heard the word ‘miracle’ in thecontext of how, in the natural universe, there was no such thing. Andyet looking at the ruined house, he suddenly knew exactly what the wordmeant, the note of grace all unexplained, the blessing inexplicable. TheDark Lord had almost won, and then in one night all the darkness andterror had ended, salvation without justification, a sudden dawn fromout of the darkness and even now nobody knew why—If Lily Potter had lived beyond her confrontation with Lord Voldemort, she would have felt that way when she saw her baby alive, afterward.“Let’s go,” whispered the baby boy, ten years later.They went.The graveyard’s entrance was guarded by a lockless gate of the sortthat kept out animals, with a place to stand while you moved the doorfrom one side of the standing-place to the other. Remus took out hiswand (Harry was already holding his) and there was a brief blur as theystepped through.Some of the stones rising up from the ground looked as old as the wallin Oxford that his father had said was around a thousand years old.Hallie Fleming, said the first stone that Harry saw, in a carving almostinvisibly faded with the erosion of time. Vienna Wood, said another.It had been a long time since Harry had visited a graveyard. His mindhad still been childlike the last time he’d come to one, long before he’dseen within Death’s shadow. Coming here now was… strange, and sad,and puzzling, and this has been happening for so long, why haven’t wizardstried to stop it, why aren’t they putting all their strength into that like Muggles dowith medical research, only more so, wizards have more reason to hope…“The Dumbledores lived in Godric’s Hollow too?” Harry said, as theywalked past a pair of relatively new stones saying Kendra Dumbledore andAriana Dumbledore.“For a long, long time,” Mr. Lupin said.They walked further into the graveyard, far toward the end, past manydeaths that had been mourned.Then Mr. Lupin pointed at a linked double headstone, of marble stillwhite and unaged.“Are there going to be messages there?” Harry said. He didn’t want todeal any more with the way that other people dealt with death.Mr. Lupin shook his head.They walked toward the linked white stones.And stood before—“What is this?” Harry whispered. “Who… who wrote this?”“Wrote what?” said Mr. Lupin, puzzled.“This!” Harry cried. “The inscription!” There were tears welling up inHarry’s eyes, at the brightness out of place and unexplained, the touchof grace where no grace should have been, the mysterious blessing, tearswelling up at“That?” Mr. Lupin said. “That’s the… motto, I suppose you could callit, of the Potters. Though I don’t think it was ever something as formal asthat. Just a saying handed down from long, long ago…”“This—that—” Harry scrambled down to kneel beside the grave,touched the inscription with a trembling hand. “How? Things like thatcan’t just be, be genetic—”Then Harry saw what tears had blurred, the faint carving of a line,within a circle, within a triangle.The symbol of the Deathly Hallows.And Harry understood.“They tried,” Harry whispered.The three Peverell brothers.Had they lost someone precious to them, was that where it had begun?“With all their lives, they tried, and they made progress—”The Cloak of Invisibility, that could defeat the Dementors’ sight.“—but their research wasn’t finished—”Hiding from Death’s shadow is not defeating Death itself. The ResurrectionStone couldn’t really bring anyone back. The Elder Wand couldn’t protect youfrom old age.“—so they passed on the mission to their children, and their children’schildren.”Generation after generation.Until it came to me.Could Time echo like that, rhyming, between this far into the future,and that far in the past? It couldn’t be coincidence, could it? Not this message, not in this place.My family.You really were, my mother and my father.“It doesn’t mean resurrecting the dead, Harry,” Mr. Lupin said. “Itmeans accepting death, and so being beyond death, mastering it.”“Did James tell you that?” Harry said, his voice strange.“No,” said Mr. Lupin, “but—”“Good.”Harry rose up slowly from where he had been kneeling, feeling asthough he were pushing up a sun upon his shoulders, raising the dawnabove the horizon.Of course other wizards have tried. I am not unique. I was never alone.These feelings in my heart, they’re not so special, not in the wizard world or theMuggle one.“Harry, your wand!” There was a sudden excitement in Mr. Lupin’svoice, and when Harry raised his wand to look at it closely, he saw that itwas gleaming ever so faintly with a silver light, welling out of the wood.“Cast the Patronus Charm!” urged Mr. Lupin. “Try casting it again,Harry!”Oh, right. So far as Mr. Lupin knows, I can’t—Harry smiled, and even laughed a little. “I’d better not,” Harry said.“If I tried to cast the spell in this state of mind, it’d probably kill me.”“What?” said Mr. Lupin. “The Patronus Charm doesn’t do that!”Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres raised his left hand, still laughing,and wiped away some more tears.“You know, Mr. Lupin,” Harry said, “it really takes a baroque interpretation to think that somebody would be walking around, ponderinghow death is just something we all have to accept, and communicatetheir state of mind by saying, ‘The last enemy that shall be destroyed isdeath.’ Maybe someone else thought it sounded poetic and picked upthe phrase and tried to interpret it differently, but whoever said it firstdidn’t like death much.” Sometimes it puzzled Harry how most peopledidn’t seem to even notice when they were twisting something around tothe 180-degree opposite of its first obvious reading. It couldn’t be a rawbrainpower thing, people could see the obvious reading of most otherEnglish sentences. “Also ‘shall be destroyed’ refers to a change of futurestate, so it can’t be about the way things are now.”Remus Lupin was staring at him with wide eyes. “You certainly areJames and Lily’s child,” the man said, sounding rather shocked.“Yes, I am,” Harry said. But that wasn’t enough, he had to do something more, so Harry raised his wand in the air and said, his voice assteady as he could make it, “I am Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, the1581 *son of Lily and James, of the house of Potter, and I accept my family’squest. Death is my enemy, and I will defeat it.”Thrayen beyn Peverlas soona ahnd thrih heera toal thissoom Dath bey yewoonen.“What?” Harry said aloud. The words had popped up into his streamof consciousness as though from his own thoughts, unexplained.“What was that?” said Remus Lupin at the same time.Harry turned, scanning the graveyard, but he didn’t see anything. Beside him, Mr. Lupin was doing the same.Neither of them noticed the tall stone worn as though from a thousand years of age, upon it a line within a circle within a triangle glowingever so faintly silver, like the light which had shone from Harry’s wand,invisible at that distance beneath the still-bright Sun.Some time later:“Thank you again, Mr. Lupin,” Harry said, the tall, faintly scarred manwas about to depart once more. “Though I really wish you hadn’t—”“Professor Dumbledore said that I was to portkey us back to Hogwartsif anything unusual happened, whether or not it seemed like an attack,”Mr. Lupin said firmly. “Which is eminently sensible.”Harry nodded. And then, having carefully saved this question for last,“Do you have any idea of what the words meant?”“If I did, I wouldn’t tell you,” Mr. Lupin said, looking rather severe.“Certainly not without Professor Dumbledore’s permission. I can understand your eagerness, but you should not go trying to uncover any ancestral secrets of the Potters until you are an adult. That means after you’vepassed your NEWTs, Harry, or at least your OWLs. And I still think you’vepicked up entirely the wrong idea of what your family motto is meant tosay!”Harry nodded, sighing internally, and bid Mr. Lupin farewell.Harry went back through Hogwarts, to the Ravenclaw Tower, feelingstrange, and strengthened. He would not have expected any of that, butit had been all to the good.He was passing through the Ravenclaw common room, on the way tohis dorm.That was when the shining creature came to him, gleaming soft whitebeneath the candlefires of the Ravenclaw common room, as it slitheredout from nowhere, the silver snake.Þregen béon Pefearles suna and þrie hira tól þissum Déað béo gewunen.Three shall be Peverell’s sons and three their devices by which Deathshall be defeated.—Spoken in the presence of the three Peverell brothers,in a small tavern on the outskirts of what would later be called Godric’sHollow.or the second time that day, Harry’s eyes filled with tears. Heedless ofthe puzzled eyes of the Ravenclaws in the common room, he reachedout to the silver creature which Draco Malfoy had sent, cradling it in hisarms like a live thing; and stumbled off in the direction of his dorm room,heading half-blindly for the bottom of his trunk, as the silver snake waitedsilently in his arms.The fifth meeting: 10:12am, Sunday, April 19th.The debtor’s meeting which Lord Malfoy had demanded from HarryPotter, who owed Lucius Malfoy a debt of some 58,203 Galleons, was heldwithin the Gringotts Central Bank, in accordance with the laws of Britain.There had been some pushback from Chief Warlock Dumbledore,trying to prevent Harry Potter from leaving the security of Hogwarts (aphrase that caused Harry Potter to raise his fingers and silently makequote marks in the air). For his own part, the Boy-Who-Lived had seemingly pondered quietly, and then assented to the meeting, strangelycompliant in the face of his enemy’s demand.The Headmaster of Hogwarts, who acted as Harry Potter’s legalguardian in the eyes of magical Britain, had overruled his ward’s assent.The Debts Committee of the Wizengamot had overruled the Headmaster of Hogwarts.The Chief Warlock had overruled the Debts Committee.The Wizengamot had overruled the Chief Warlock.And so the Boy-Who-Lived had departed under the heavy guard ofMad-Eye Moody and an Auror trio for the Gringotts Central Bank; withMoody’s bright-blue eye rotating wildly in every direction, as though tosignal to any possible attacker that he was On Guard and Constantly Vigilant and would cheerfully incinerate the kidneys of anyone who sneezedin the general direction of the Boy-Who-Lived.Harry Potter watched more keenly than before, as they marchedthrough the wide-open front doors of Gringotts, beneath the motto Fortius Quo Fidelius. On Harry’s last three visits to Gringotts he had merelyadmired the marble pillars, the gold-burning torchlights, the architecture not quite like the human parts of magical Britain. Since then hadcome the Incident at Azkaban and other things; and now, on his fourthvisit, Harry was thinking about the Goblin Rebellions and goblins’ ongoing resentment at not being allowed to own wands and certain factswhich hadn’t been in the first-year History textbook, which Harry hadguessed at by pattern-matching and which Professor Flitwick had confirmed in a very quiet voice. Lord Voldemort had killed goblins as wellas wizards—an incredibly stupid move on Lord Voldemort’s part, unlessHarry was really missing something—but what goblins thought of theBoy-Who-Lived, Harry had no idea. Goblins had a reputation for payingwhat they owed and taking what they thought owed them, along witha reputation for interpreting those accounts in a somewhat prejudicedfashion.Today, the guards standing upright in armor at regular intervalsaround the bank were staring at the Boy-Who-Lived with blank faces,and glaring at Moody and the Aurors with flashes of bitter contempt.At the stands and counters of the bank’s foyer, goblin tellers staredwith equal contempt at the wizards whose hands they were filling withGalleons; one teller smiled a sharp-toothed grin at a witch who waslooking angry and desperate.If I understand human nature correctly—and if I’m right that all the humanoid magical species are genetically human plus a heritable magical effect—then you’re not likely to become friends with a wizard just because I’m politeto you, or say that I’m sympathetic. But I wonder if you would back the BoyWho-Lived in a bid to overthrow the Ministry, if I promised to revoke the WandLaw afterward… or if I quietly gave you wands, and spellbooks, in exchange foryour support… is that why the secret of wand-making is restricted to people likeOllivander? Though if you really are human, just plain human, then the goblinnation probably has its own internal horrors, its own Azkabans, for that is alsohuman nature; in which case sooner or later I must overthrow or reform your owngovernment as well. Hm.An aged goblin appeared before them, and Harry inclined his headwith careful courtesy, a gesture that the aged goblin returned with anabrupt half-nod. There was no wild train ride; instead the aged goblinushered them into a short hallway that terminated in a small waitingroom, with three goblin-sized benches and one wizard-sized chair,within which nobody sat.“Do not sign anything that Lucius Malfoy gives you,” Mad-Eye Moodysaid. “Nothing, do you understand me, lad? If Malfoy hands you a copyof The Wonderful Adventures of the Boy-Who-Lived and asks you for an autograph, tell him that you’ve sprained a finger. Don’t pick up a quill fora single second while you’re in Gringotts. If someone hands you a quill,break the quill and then break your own fingers. Do I need to explainfurther, son?”“Not particularly,” Harry said. “We also have lawyers in MuggleBritain, and they’d think your lawyers are cute.”A short time later Harry Potter handed his wand over to an armoredgoblin guard who frisked him with all manner of interesting-lookingprobes, and gave his pouch to Moody to keep.And then Harry stepped through another door, and a brief waterfallof Thief’s Downfall, which evaporated from his skin as soon as he steppedout.On the other side of the door was a larger room, richly paneledand appointed, with a great golden table stretching across it; two hugeleather chairs on one side of the table, and a small wooden stool on theother, the debtor’s perch. Two goblins in full armor, wearing ornateearpieces and glasses, stood watch around the room. Neither side wouldhave wands or any other device of magic, and the goblin guards wouldattack immediately if anyone dared to use wandless magic within thispeaceable meeting supervised by Gringotts Bank. The ornate earpieceswould prevent the goblin guards from hearing the conversation unlessdirectly addressed, the eyepieces would leave the wizards’ faces as blurs.It was, in short, something along the lines of actual security, at least ifyou were an Occlumens.Harry climbed up onto his uncomfortable wooden stool, thinking Subtle in a tone of some mental sarcasm, and awaited his creditors.It was only a brief interval later, much shorter than the time a debtorcould legally be made to wait, when Lucius Malfoy entered into the room,taking up his leather chair with motions worn smooth by practice. Hissnake-headed cane was missing from his hands, his long white manedrifted behind him the same as ever, his face could not be read.Quietly following behind him was a young boy with white-blonde hair,now wearing black robes far finer than any Hogwarts uniform, who followed in his father’s footsteps with a controlled face. A boy who wasalso Harry’s creditor to the tune of forty Galleons, and also of House Malfoy, and therefore, technically, covered by the Wizengamot resolution enabling this meeting.Draco. Harry didn’t say it aloud, didn’t let his own expression change.He could not think of what to say. Not even I’m sorry seemed appropriate.Harry hadn’t dared say any of that to Draco’s Patronus either, when theyhad set up this meeting in a few brief exchanges; and not only becauseLucius might be listening. It had been enough to know that Draco’s happythought was still happy, and that he had still been able to want Harry toknow it.Lucius Malfoy spoke first, his voice level, his face set. “I do not understand what is happening at Hogwarts, Harry Potter. Would you care toexplain it to me?”“I don’t know,” Harry said. “If I understood these events I would nothave let them happen, Lord Malfoy.”“Then answer me this question. Who are you?”Harry gazed evenly at the face of his creditor. “I’m not You-KnowWho, like you thought I was,” Harry said. Not being a complete idiot, he’deventually worked out who Lucius Malfoy had thought he was talking toin front of the Wizengamot. “Obviously I’m not a normal boy. Equally obviously, that probably has something to do with the Boy-Who-Lived business. But I don’t know what, or why, any more than you do. I asked theSorting Hat and it didn’t know either.”Lucius Malfoy nodded distantly. “I could not think of any reason whyyou would pay a hundred thousand Galleons to save a mudblood’s life.No reason save one, which would account for her power and bloodthirstalike; but then she died at the hands of a troll, and yet you lived. And alsomy son has told me much of you, Harry Potter, which did not make the tiniestbit of sense, I have heard the ravings of the mad in St. Mungo’s and theywere more sensible by far than the events which my son told me underVeritaserum that you enacted, and that portion of this raving lunacy, whichyou personally carried out, I would have you explain to me, and now.”Harry turned to look at Draco, who looked back at him with a face thatwas screwing up, being controlled, and then tensing up again.“I’d also,” Draco Malfoy said in a high and wavering voice, “like, toknow, why, Potter.”Harry closed his eyes, and spoke without looking. “A boy raised byMuggles who thought he was clever. You saw me, Draco, and you thoughtof how very useful it would be if the Boy-Who-Lived, out of all the otherchildren in your year, could be shown the truth of things, if we could befriends. And I thought the same thing about you. Only, you and I believeddifferent things were true. Not that I’m saying that there are differenttruths, I mean, there’s different beliefs but there’s only one reality, onlyone universe that can make those beliefs true or false—”“You lied to me.”Harry opened his eyes and looked at Draco. “I would prefer to say,”Harry said, not quite with a steady voice, “that the things I told you weretrue from a certain point of view.”“A certain point of view?” Draco Malfoy looked every bit as angry as LukeSkywalker’d had the right to be, and not in a mood to accept Kenobi’sexcuses, either. “There’s a word for things that are true from a certainpoint of view. They’re called lies!”“Or tricks,” Harry said evenly. “Statements which are technically truebut which deceive the listener into forming further beliefs which are false.I think it’s worth making that distinction. What I told you was a selffulfilling prophecy; you believed that you couldn’t deceive yourself, so youdidn’t try. The skills you’ve learned are real, and it would have been verybad for you to start fighting against them internally. People can’t makethemselves believe that blue is green by an act of will, but they think theycan, and that can be almost as bad.”“You used me,” said Draco Malfoy.“I only used you in ways that made you stronger. That’s what it meansto be used by a friend.”“Even I know that’s not what friendship is!”Now Lucius Malfoy spoke again. “For what purpose? To what end?”Even the elder Malfoy’s voice was not quite steady. “Why?”Harry regarded him for a moment, and then turned to Draco. “Yourfather’s probably not going to believe this,” Harry said. “But you, Draco,should be able to see that everything which has happened is compatiblewith this hypothesis. And that any more cynical hypothesis wouldn’t explain why I didn’t press you harder when you thought I had leverage, orwhy I taught you so much. I thought that the heir of House Malfoy, who’dbeen publicly seen to grab a Muggleborn girl to stop her falling off theroof of Hogwarts, would be a good compromise candidate to lead magical Britain after the reformation.”“So you would have me believe,” Lucius Malfoy said in a thin voice,“that you are claiming to be mad. Well, let us leave all that aside. Tell mewho set that troll on Hogwarts.”“I don’t know,” Harry said.“Tell me who you suspect, Harry Potter.”“I have four suspects. One of them is Professor Snape—”“Snape?” Draco burst out.“The second, of course, is the Defense Professor of Hogwarts, just because he’s the Defense Professor.” Harry would have left him out, notwanting to bring Professor Quirrell to the Malfoys’ attention if he was innocent, but Draco might have called him on that. “The third, you wouldn’tbelieve me about. The fourth is a catchall category called Everything Else.”And the fifth, Lord Voldemort, I do not think I should name to you.Lucius Malfoy’s face contorted in a snarl. “Do you think I cannot recognize bait upon your hook? Tell me about this third possibility, Potter,the one you wish me to believe is the true answer, and leave aside games.”Harry regarded Lord Malfoy steadily. “I once read a book I wasn’t supposed to read, and it told me this: Communication is an event that takesplace between equals. Employees lie to their bosses, who, in turn, expectto be lied to. I’m not playing coy, I’m observing that it’s simply not possible, in our present situation, for me to tell you about the third suspect,and have you believe that my story was anything but a lure.”Draco spoke then. “It’s Father, isn’t it?”Harry gave Draco a startled look.Draco spoke evenly. “You suspect that Father sent the troll into Hogwarts to get at Granger, don’t you? That’s what you’re thinking, isn’t it!”Harry opened his mouth to say, Actually, no, and then managed tothink ahead and stop himself for once in his life.“I see…” Harry said slowly. “That’s what this is about. Lucius Malfoypublicly says that Hermione won’t get away with what she’s done, and loand behold, a troll kills her.” Harry smiled then, in a way that bared histeeth. “And if I deny that here, then Draco, who isn’t an Occlumens, canthen testify under Veritaserum that the Boy-Who-Lived does not suspect1591 *Lucius Malfoy of having sent a troll into Hogwarts to kill Hermione Granger, sworn to the Noble House of Potter, whose blood debt was recentlypurchased for a hundred thousand Galleons et cetera.” Harry leaned backslightly, though his wooden stool had no back with which to do it properly.“But now that it’s been pointed out, I see that it’s very reasonable. Obviously you killed Hermione Granger, just like you threatened to do in frontof the whole Wizengamot.”“I did not,” Lucius Malfoy said, expressionless once more.Harry bared his teeth again in that non-smile. “Well then, in that case,there must be someone else out there who killed Hermione and messedwith the Hogwarts wards, the same person who earlier tried to frame Hermione for Draco Malfoy’s murder. Either you killed Hermione Granger afterbeing paid for her life, or you blamed your son’s attempted murder on aninnocent girl and took all my family’s money under false pretenses, oneof those two things must be true.”“Perhaps you killed her in hopes of your money being returned.” Lucius Malfoy had leaned forward, and was staring hard at Harry.“Then I would not have given away my money for her in the first place.As you already know. Don’t insult my intelligence, Lord Malfoy—no, wait,sorry, you just had to say that in case Draco had to testify to it, nevermind.”Lucius Malfoy sat back in his chair and stared.“I tried to tell you, Father,” Draco said under his breath, “but nobodycan imagine Harry Potter until they’ve actually met him…”Harry tapped a finger on his cheek. “So people are starting to figure out the blatantly obvious? I’m surprised, actually. I wouldn’t havepredicted that would happen.” Harry had by now caught the generalrhythm of Professor Quirrell’s cynicism and was able to generate it independently. “I wouldn’t think a newspaper would be able to report ona concept like ‘Either X or Y must be true, but we don’t know which.’I would only expect journalists to report stories consisting of series ofatomic propositions, like ‘X is true’, ‘Y is false’, or ‘X is true and Y is false’.Not more complex logical connectors like ‘If X is true then Y is true,but we don’t know whether X is true’. And all your supporters ought tobe rapidly switching between ‘You can’t prove that Lord Malfoy killedGranger, it could’ve been someone else’ and ‘You can’t prove there wassomeone else to frame Granger’, so long as it’s uncertain they shouldbe trying to have it both ways at once… wait, don’t you own the DailyProphet?”“The Daily Prophet,” Lucius Malfoy said thinly, “which I certainly donot own, is far too respectable to publish any such scurrilous nonsense.Unfortunately, not all wizards of influence are so reasonable.”“Ah. Got it.” Harry nodded.Lucius glanced at Draco. “The rest of what he said—was any of it important?”“No, Father, it was not.”“Thank you, son.” Lucius returned his gaze to Harry. His voice, whenhe spoke, was something closer to his usual drawl, cool and confident.“It is possible that I could be persuaded to show you some favor, if youadmitted before the Wizengamot what you clearly know, that I was notresponsible for this deed. I would be willing to reduce your remainingdebt to House Malfoy quite significantly, or even adjust the terms to allowlater repayment.”Harry regarded Lucius Malfoy steadily. “Lucius Malfoy. You are nowperfectly aware that Hermione Granger was, in fact, framed using yourson as bait, that she was False-Memory-Charmed or worse, and thatHouse Potter held nothing against you before that. My counterproposalis that you return my family’s money, I announce before the Wizengamot that House Potter holds House Malfoy no animus, and we presenta united front against whoever’s doing this. We decide to screw the roleswe’re supposed to play, and ally with each other instead of fighting. Itcould be the one thing the enemy doesn’t expect us to do.”There was a brief silence in the room, except for the two goblin guardswho went on breathing regardless.“You are mad,” Lucius Malfoy said coldly.“It’s called justice, Lord Malfoy. You cannot possibly expect me to cooperate with you while you are holding the wealth of House Potter underwhat you now know to be false pretenses. I understand how it looked toyou at the time, but you know better now.”“You have nothing to offer me worth a hundred thousand Galleons.”“Don’t I?” Harry said distantly. “I wonder. I think it quite probablethat you care more about the long-term welfare of House Malfoy thanabout whichever political issue the last generation’s failed Dark Lordmade his personal hobbyhorse.” Harry glanced significantly at Draco.“The next generation is drawing its own battle lines and forming newalliances. Your son can be frozen out of that, or he can go straight to thetop. Is that worth more to you than forty thousand Galleons you weren’tparticularly expecting and don’t particularly need?” Harry smiled thinly.“Forty thousand Galleons. Two million Muggle pounds sterling. Yourson knows some things about the size of the Muggle economy that mightsurprise you. They’d find it amusing, that the fate of a country was revolving around two million pounds sterling. They’d think it was cute. And Ithink much the same, Lord Malfoy. This isn’t about me being desperate.This is about you getting a fair chance to be fair.”“Oh?” said Lord Malfoy. “And if I refuse your fair chance, what then?”Harry shrugged. “Depends what sort of coalition government getsput together without the Malfoys. If the government can be reformedpeacefully and it would disturb the peace to do otherwise, I’ll pay you themoney out of petty cash. Or maybe the Death Eaters will be retried forpast crimes and executed as a matter of justice, as a result of due legalprocess, of course.”“You truly are mad,” Lucius Malfoy said quietly. “You have no power,no wealth, and yet you say such things to me.”“Yes, it’s silly to think I could scare you. After all, you’re not a Dementor.”And Harry went on smiling. He’d looked it up, and apparently a bezoar would heal almost any poison if you shoved it into someone’s mouthfast enough. Maybe that wouldn’t repair radiation damage from Transfigured polonium, but then again, maybe it would. So Harry had lookedup the freezing points of various acids, and it turned out that sulfuricacid would freeze at just ten degrees Celsius, which meant Harry couldbuy a liter of acid on the Muggle market, freeze it solid, and Transfigureit down to a tiny little unnoticable water-ice chip to be flipped into someone’s mouth and ingested. No bezoar would compensate for that, oncethe Transfiguration wore off. Harry had no intention of saying it out loud,of course, but now that he’d failed decisively to prevent any deaths during his quest, he had no further intention of being restrained by the lawor even the code of Batman.Last chance to live, Lucius. Ethically speaking, your life was bought and paidfor the day you committed your first atrocity for the Death Eaters. You’re still human and your life still has intrinsic value, but you no longer have the deontologicalprotection of an innocent. Any good person is licensed to kill you now, if they thinkit’ll save net lives in the long run; and I will conclude as much of you, if you beginto get in my way. Whoever sent the troll after Granger must have targeted you tooand hit you with some curse that makes former Death Eaters melt into a pile ofgoo. Very sad.“Father,” Draco said in a small voice. “I think you should consider it,father.”Lucius Malfoy looked at his son. “You jest.”“It’s true. I don’t think Potter just made up his books, nobody couldhave written all that and there were things in them that I could check formyself. And if even half of all that is true, he’s right, a hundred thousandGalleons won’t mean much. If we give it to him he really will be friendswith House Malfoy again—the way he thinks of being friends, anyway.And if we don’t, he’ll be your enemy, whether it’s in his own interests ornot, he’ll just go after you. Harry Potter really does think like that. It’s notabout money to him, it’s about what he thinks is honor.”Harry Potter inclined his head, still smiling.“But let’s get one part of it straight,” Draco said, now staring directlyat him. There was a fierce light in his eyes. “You wronged me. And you oweme.”“Acknowledged,” Harry said quietly. “Conditional on the rest of it, ofcourse.”Lucius Malfoy opened his mouth to say who-knew-what and thenclosed it again. “Mad,” he said again.There was a long father-and-son argument during which Harry managed to keep his mouth shut.When it seemed that even Draco wouldn’t be able to persuade his father, Harry spoke up again, and proposed his intended next steps, if theHouses of Potter and Malfoy could cooperate.Then came more argument between Lucius and Draco, during whichHarry again stayed silent.Finally Lucius Malfoy’s eyes turned to gaze at Harry. “And you believe,” Lucius Malfoy said, “that you can persuade Longbottom and Bonesto go along with this notion, even if Dumbledore opposes it.”Harry nodded. “They’ll be suspicious of your involvement, of course.But I’ll tell them that it was my plan to start with, and that should help.”“I suppose,” Lucius Malfoy said after a pause, “that I could have a contract drawn up, absolving you of almost all the remaining debt, if by somechance I do go along with this mad idea. It shall need more guarantees,of course—”Harry promptly reached into his robes and drew out a parchment, unfolding it and spreading it across the golden table. “I’ve taken the libertymyself, actually,” Harry said. He’d spent some careful hours in the Hogwarts library with the law books available. Thankfully, so far as Harrycould tell, the laws of magical Britain were charmingly simple by Mugglestandards. Writing that the original blood debt and payment was cancelled, the Potters’ wealth and all other vault items would be returned,and the remaining debt annulled, all with no fault to the Malfoys, wasonly a few more lines than it took to say out loud. “I had to promise mykeepers not to sign anything you gave me. So I made sure to composethis myself, and sign it before I left.”Draco emitted a choked laugh.Lucius read through the contract, smiling humorlessly. “How charmingly straightforward.”“I also promised not to touch a quill while I was in Gringotts,” Harrysaid. He reached into his robes again and drew out a Muggle pen, alongwith a sheet of normal paper. “Will this wording be all right?” Harryrapidly scribbled down a legal-sounding statement to the effect thatHouse Potter didn’t hold House Malfoy responsible in any way for Hermione Granger’s murder and didn’t believe they had anything to do withit, then held up the paper in the air for Lord Malfoy’s inspection.Lord Malfoy looked at the paper, rolled his eyes slightly, and said,“Good enough, I suppose. Though to have the proper meaning, youshould use the legal term indemnify rather than exonerate—”“Nice try, but no. I know exactly what that word means, Lord Malfoy.”Harry took his parchment and began copying down his original wordingmore carefully.When Harry was done, Lord Malfoy reached across the golden tableand took the pen, looking at it thoughtfully. “One of your Muggle artefacts, I suppose? What does this do, son?”“It writes without needing an inkwell,” Draco answered.“I can see that. I suppose some might find it an amusing trinket.” Lucius smoothed the parchment contract over the table, then set his handby the line for signatures, tapping the pen thoughtfully on the startingspot.Harry wrenched his eyes away, up to Lucius Malfoy’s face, forcinghimself to breathe regularly, not quite able to stop his muscles from tensing.“Our good friend, Severus Snape,” said Lucius Malfoy, still tappingthe pen on the line awaiting his signature. “The Defense Professor, calling himself Quirrell. Now I ask again, who is your third suspect, HarryPotter?”“I would strongly advise that you sign first, Lord Malfoy, if you’re going to do so anyway. You will benefit from this information more if youdo not think I am trying to persuade you of something.”Another humorless smile. “I shall take my chances. Speak, if you wishthis to continue.”Harry hesitated, then said evenly, “My third suspect is Albus Dumbledore.”The tapping pen stilled on the parchment. “A strange allegation,” Lucius drawled. “Dumbledore lost much face when a Hogwarts student diedwithin his tenure. Do you suppose that I will believe anything of him, onlybecause he is my enemy?”“He is one suspect among several, Lord Malfoy, and not necessarilythe most plausible. But the reason I was able to kill a full-grown mountaintroll was that I had a weapon which Dumbledore gave to me, at the startof the school year. It’s not strong evidence, but it’s suspicious. And ifyou’re thinking that murdering one of his students is not Dumbledore’sstyle, well, the same thought had occurred to me.”“It’s not his style?” Draco Malfoy said.Lucius Malfoy shook his head in a measured, careful movement. “Notquite, my son. Dumbledore is particular in his evils.” Lord Malfoy leanedback into his chair, and then sat quite still. “Tell me of this weapon.”“I am not yet certain I should go into details about that in your presence, Lord Malfoy.” Harry took a breath. “Let me be clear on this. I am nottrying to sell you on the idea that Dumbledore is behind this, just raisingthe possibility—”Then Draco Malfoy spoke. “The device Dumbledore gave you—was itsomething to kill trolls? I mean, just trolls? Can you tell us that?”Lucius turned his head to look at his son with some surprise.“No…” Harry said slowly. “It wasn’t specifically a sword of anti-trollslaying, or anything like that.”Draco’s eyes were intent. “Would the device have worked against anassassin?”Not if they had shields raised. “No.”“A fight in school?”An expanding rock in the throat is inherently lethal. “No. I don’t think itwas meant for use against humans.”Draco nodded. “So just magical creatures. Would it have been a goodweapon against an angry Hippogriff, or something like that?”“Does the Stunning Hex work on Hippogriffs?” Harry said slowly.“I don’t know,” said Draco.“Yes,” said Lucius Malfoy.Compared to trying to target a Wingardium Leviosa and Finite Incantatem—“Then a Stunning Hex would be a better way of dealing with a Hippogriff.”Put that way, it did seem increasingly like a Transfigured rock was an optimal weapon only against a flesh-and-blood magical creature with spellresistant skin. “But… I mean, it might not have been intended as a weaponat all, I used it in a strange way, it could have just been a crazy whim—”“No,” Lucius Malfoy said lowly. “Not a whim. Not coincidence. NotDumbledore.”“Then it’s him,” Draco said. Slowly Draco’s eyes narrowed, and hegave a vicious nod. “It’s been him since the beginning. The court Legilimens said that someone had used Legilimency on Granger. Dumbledoreadmitted that it was him. And I bet the wards did go off when Grangercursed me and Dumbledore just ignored them.”“But—” Harry said. He looked at Lucius, wondering if it was really tohis advantage to question this idea. “What would be his motive? Are wegoing to say he’s evil and leave it at that?”Draco Malfoy jumped out of his chair and began pacing around theroom, black robes swishing behind the young boy, the goblin guards staring at him in some surprise through their enchanted goggles. “To figureout a strange plot, look at what happens, then ask who benefits. Exceptthat Dumbledore didn’t plan on you trying to save Granger at her trial, hetried to stop you from doing that. What would’ve happened if Grangerhad gone to Azkaban? House Malfoy and House Potter would’ve hatedeach other forever. Of all the suspects, the only one who wants that isDumbledore. So it fits. It all fits. The one who really committed the murder is—Albus Dumbledore!”“Um,” Harry said. “But why give me an anti-troll weapon? I said it wassuspicious, I didn’t say that it made any sense.”Draco nodded thoughtfully. “Maybe Dumbledore thought you’d stopthe troll before it got Granger and then he could blame Father for sendingit. A lot of people would be very angry if they thought Father had even triedto do something like that, in Hogwarts. Like Father said, Dumbledoremust’ve lost face when people found out that a student had actually diedin Hogwarts, being safe is what Hogwarts is famous for. So that partprobably wasn’t supposed to happen.”Harry’s mind involuntarily flashed back to the horror in Dumbledore’s eyes when he’d seen Hermione Granger’s body.Would I have gotten there in time, if the Weasley twins hadn’t had their magicmap stolen? Could that have been the plan? And then, though Dumbledore didn’tknow it, somebody stole their map, and I was too late… but no, that doesn’t makemuch sense, I found out too late, how could Dumbledore have guessed that I’d usea broomstick… well, he did know I had one…There was no way a plan like that could work.And it hadn’t.But someone going a little bit senile might expect it to work, and aphoenix might not know the difference.“Or,” Draco Malfoy continued, still pacing energetically, “maybe Dumbledore had an enchanted troll around, and he expected you to defeat itsome other time, for some other plot, and then he used the troll on Granger instead. I can’t imagine Dumbledore had this all planned since thefirst week of lessons—”“I can imagine,” Lucius Malfoy said in low tones. “I have seen such,from Dumbledore.”Draco nodded decisively. “Then I was never supposed to die in the firstplot. Dumbledore knew Professor Quirrell was checking on me, or Dumbledore planned to have someone else find me in time—I couldn’t havetestified against Granger if I was dead, and he’d have lost face if I’d died.But my leaving Hogwarts and not being around to lead Slytherin wouldbe just right for him. And then the next time Harry was supposed to stopthe troll before it got Granger and everyone was supposed to blame you,Father, only that time it didn’t go the way Dumbledore planned.”Lucius Malfoy lifted his grey eyes, from where he’d been gazing withopen surprise at his son. “If this is true—but I wonder if Harry Potter isonly playing at being reluctant to believe it.”“Maybe,” Draco said. “But I’m pretty sure he isn’t.”“Then, if it is true…” Lucius Malfoy’s voice trailed off. A slow fury waslighting in his eyes.“What would we do, exactly?” Harry said.“That, too, is clear to me,” Draco said. He whirled on them and raiseda finger high in the air. “We shall find the proof to convict Dumbledoreof this crime, and bring him to justice!”Harry Potter and Lucius Malfoy looked at each other.Neither of them quite knew what to say.“My son,” Lucius Malfoy said after a time, “truly, you have done verywell this day.”“Thank you, Father!”“However, this is not a play, we are not Aurors, and we do not put ourtrust in trials.”Some of the light went out of Draco’s eyes. “Oh.”“I, ah, do have a sentimental fondness for trials,” Harry interjected.I cannot believe I am having this conversation. He needed to go home andtake a sheet of paper and a pencil and try to figure out whether Draco’sreasoning actually made sense. “And evidence.”Lucius Malfoy turned his gaze to Harry Potter then, and his eyes simmered in pure grey fury.“If you have deceived me,” Lucius Malfoy said in tones of low anger, “ifall this is a lie, then I will not forgive. But if this is not deception… Bringme the proof to convict Dumbledore of this murder before the Wizengamot, or evidence enough to have him cast down, and there is nothingthat House Malfoy will not do for you, Harry Potter. Nothing.”Harry took a deep breath. He needed to sort all this out and figure outthe actual probabilities, but he didn’t have time. “If it is Dumbledore, thenremoving him from the gameboard leaves a huge hole in Britain’s powerstructure.”“So it does,” Lucius Malfoy said with a grim smile. “Did you have ambitions of filling it yourself, Harry Potter?”“Some of your opposition might not like that. They could fight.”“They will lose,” Lucius Malfoy said, now with a face hard like iron.“So this is what I’d want House Malfoy to do for me, Lord Malfoy, ifDumbledore gets removed because of me. When the opposition is mostfrightened—that’s when they’ll be offered a last-minute arrangement toavoid a civil war. Some of your allies might not prefer it, but there’ll bea lot of neutrals who’ll be glad to see stability. The bargain will be thatinstead of you taking over right away, Draco Malfoy will take power whenhe comes of age.”“What?” Draco said.“Draco has testified under Veritaserum that he tried to help Hermione Granger. I bet there’d be a lot of people in the opposition who’d takea chance on him rather than fight. I’m not sure how exactly you’d enforce it—Unbreakable Vows or Gringotts contracts or what—but there’llbe some sort of enforceable compact about power going to Draco afterhe graduates Hogwarts. I’ll throw any support the Boy-Who-Lived hasbehind that bargain. Try to persuade Longbottom and Bones and so on.Our first plan paves the way for that later, if you’re careful to act honorable when you deal with Longbottom and Bones this time around.”“Father, I swear I didn’t—”1601 *Lucius’s face twisted into a grim smile. “I know you didn’t, son. Well.”The white-haired man stared across the mighty golden table at Harry Potter. “Those terms are acceptable to me. But fail in any part of our agreement, whether our first bargain, or the second, and there shall be consequences for you, Harry Potter. Clever words will not halt that.”And Lucius Malfoy signed the parchment.Mad-Eye Moody had been staring at the bronze door of the Gringottsmeeting room for what seemed like hours, insofar as a man could stareat any one thing when his gaze always saw in all directions.The trouble with trying to be suspicious of a man like Lucius Malfoy,Moody thought, was that you could spend an entire day thinking of everything he might be up to, and still not have finished.The door cracked open and Harry Potter trudged out, small beads ofsweat still on his forehead.“Did you sign anything?” Mad-Eye demanded upon the instant.Harry Potter looked at him silently, then reached into his robes anddrew out a folded parchment. “The goblins are already executing this,”said Harry Potter. “They made three copies before I left.”“MERLIN DAMN IT SON—” Moody paused as his Eye caught sight ofthe second half of the document as Harry Potter slowly, as though reluctantly, began to unfold the top upward. A glance sufficed to take in theparagraphs drawn in careful handwriting, Lucius Malfoy’s elegant signature below Harry Potter’s. And then Moody exploded, even as the top halfof the document also began to enter his Sight. “You exonerate House Malfoy of any involvement in Hermione Granger’s death? Do you have any ideawhat you’ve done, you little fool? Why in Merlin’s name would you dosomething like WHAT—”Sunday, April 19th, 6:34pm.aphne Greengrass walked quietly toward the Greengrass room belowthe Slytherin dungeons, the privilege of an Ancient House; on herway to drop off her trunk from the Hogwarts Express, before she joinedthe other students for dinner. The whole private area had been hers aloneever since Malfoy had gone. Her hand, held behind her, made repeatedcome-along gestures at her huge emerald-studded trunk, which seemedhesitant to follow. Maybe the enchantments on the sturdy old family device needed to be reapplied; or maybe her trunk was reluctant to followher into Hogwarts, which was no longer safe.There’d been a long talk between Mother and Father, after they’d beentold about Hermione; with Daphne hiding around a doorway to listen,choking back her tears and trying not to make sounds.Mother had said that the sad fact was that if only one student died every year, well, that still made Hogwarts safer than Beauxbatons, let aloneDurmstrang. There were more ways for a young witch to die than being murdered. Beauxbatons’s Transfiguration Master just wasn’t on thesame level as McGonagall, Mother had said.Father had soberly remarked how important it was for the Greengrassheir to stay at Hogwarts where all the other Noble families sent their children to school (it was the reason for the old tradition of the Noble families synchronizing the birth of their heirs, to put them in the same yearof Hogwarts, if they could). And Father had said that being heiress to aMost Ancient House meant you couldn’t always stay away from trouble.She could have done without hearing that last part.Daphne gulped hard, as she turned the doorknob, and opened thedoor.“Miss Greengrass—” whispered a shadowy, silvery-robed figure.Daphne screamed and slammed the door and drew her wand andturned to run.“Wait!” cried the voice, now higher and louder.Daphne paused. That couldn’t possibly be who it had sounded like.Slowly, Daphne turned, and opened the door again.“You!” Daphne said in astonishment, as she saw the face beneath thehood. “I thought you were—”“I come back to you now,” the silvery-robed figure said in a strongvoice, “at the turn of the—”“What are you doing in my bedroom?” shrieked Daphne.“I heard you can cast the mist form of the Patronus Charm. Can I see?”Daphne stared, and then her blood began to burn. “Why?” she said,keeping her wand level. “So you can kill everyone in Slytherin who castsun-Slytherin spells? We all know who it was had Hermione killed!”The figure’s voice rose. “I testified under Veritaserum that I tried tohelp Miss Granger! I really was trying to help her, when I grabbed herhand on the roof, when I helped her off the floor—”Daphne kept her wand level. “Like your father couldn’t tamper withthe Aurors’ record, if he wanted to! I wasn’t born yesterday, Mister Malfoy!”Slowly, as if not to cause alarm, the silver-robed figure drew a wandfrom his robes. Daphne’s hand tightened on her own wand, but then sherecognized the position of the fingers on the wand, the stance the figurewas assuming, and she drew a shocked breath—“Expecto Patronum!”Silver light leapt from the end of the other’s wand—and condensed,forming a shining serpent that seemed to coil in the air as though nestingthere.She just gaped.“I did try to help Hermione Granger,” Draco Malfoy said with a levelvoice. “Because I know the sickness at the heart of Slytherin’s House, thereason why so many of us can’t cast the Patronus Charm any more, ishate. Hate of Muggleborns, or just anyone really. People think that’sall Slytherin is about now, not cunning or ambition or honorable nobility. And I even know, because it’s obvious if you just look, that HermioneGranger wasn’t weak at magic.”Daphne’s mind had gone completely blank. Her eyes darted aroundnervously, just to check that there wasn’t blood coming from under thedoors, like the last time Something had Broken.“And I’ve also figured out,” Draco Malfoy said quietly, as the silversnake went on shining with unmistakeable light and warmth, “thatHermione Granger never really tried to kill me. Maybe she was FalseMemory-Charmed, maybe she was Legilimized, but now that she’s beenmurdered, it’s obvious that Miss Granger was the target in the first place,when somebody tried to set her up for murdering me—”“D-do-do you know what you’re saying?” Daphne’s voice broke. If Lucius Malfoy heard his heir saying that—he’d skin Draco and turn him intotrousers!Draco Malfoy smiled, metallic robes gleaming in the light of his fullcorporeal Patronus; it was a smile both arrogant and dangerous, like being turned into a pair of leather pants was beneath his concerns. “Yes,”said Draco, “but it doesn’t matter now. House Malfoy is returning HousePotter’s money and cancelling the debt.”Daphne walked over to her bed and then fell on it, hoping she couldwake up from the dream once she was in bed.“I’d like you to join a conspiracy,” said the figure in the shining robes.“Everyone in Slytherin who can cast the Patronus Charm, and everyonewho can learn. That’s how we’ll know to trust each other, when the Silvery Slytherins meet.” With a dramatic gesture, Draco Malfoy cast backhis hood. “But it won’t work without you, Daphne Greengrass. You andyour family. Your mother will negotiate it with Father, but I’d like theGreengrasses to hear the proposal from you, first.” Draco Malfoy’s voicelowered grimly. “There is much we must speak of, before we eat dinner.”Harry Potter had, apparently, taken to being invisible; they’d glimpsedhis hand only briefly, when he was handing them the list, written onstrange not-parchment. Harry had explained that, all things considered,he didn’t really think it was smart for him to be findable except on specialoccasions, so he was just going to deal with people as a disembodiedfloating voice from now on, or as a brilliant silver light that hid behindcorners where nobody could see it, and which could always find hisfriends no matter where they tried to hide. It was, in all honesty, oneof the creepiest things which Fred and George had ever heard, over alifetime which had included filling the shoes of every student in secondyear Slytherin with Transfigured live millipedes. Fred and George didn’tthink this could possibly be good for anyone’s sanity, but they didn’tknow what to say. It couldn’t be denied, they’d seen with their own foureyes, that Hogwarts……wasn’t safe…“I don’t know who you went to for the False Memory Charm on RitaSkeeter,” said the sourceless voice of Harry Potter. “Whoever it is… probably won’t be able to fill this order directly, but they may know someonewho can get things from the Muggle world. And—I know it may cost extra, but as few people as possible should know that Harry Potter is relatedto this.” Another flash of a small boy’s hand, and a bag hit the groundwith the clinking noise. “Some of these items are expensive even in theMuggle world, and your contact may have to go outside Britain; but onehundred Galleons will be enough to pay for it all, I hope. I’d tell you wherethe Galleons came from, but I don’t want to spoil tomorrow’s surprise.”“What is this stuff?” said Fred or George, as they looked over the list.“Our father is a Muggle expert—”“—and we don’t recognize half this stuff—”“—why, we don’t recognize any of it—”“—just what are you planning to do?”“Things have become serious,” Harry’s voice said softly. “I don’t knowwhat I’ll have to do. I may need the power of the Muggles, not just the wizards, before this is done—and I might need it right away, with no time toprepare. I’m not planning to use any of this. I just want it around in caseof… contingencies.” Harry’s voice paused. “Obviously I owe you morethan I can ever repay and you won’t let me give you any of what you deserve, I don’t even know how to say thank you properly, and all I can do ishope that someday when you grow up you’ll be more sensible about thiswhole thing and would you please take a ten percent commission—”“Shut up, you,” said George or Fred.“For God’s sake, you went after a troll for me and Fred had his ribsbroken!”They both just shook their heads. Harry had stayed behind whenthey’d told him to run, and stepped forward to distract the troll fromeating George. Harry was the kind of person, they knew, who’d thinkthat something like that didn’t cancel out what he owed the Weasleytwins, that his own deed wasn’t properly commensurate. But what theWeasleys knew, and Harry wouldn’t understand until he was older, wasthat it meant that nothing was owed, or ever could be owed betweenthem. It was a strange kind of selfishness, they thought, that Harrycould understand kindness within himself—never dreaming of askingof money from anyone he’d helped more than they’d helped him, or calling that a debt—while being apparently unable to conceive that othersmight want to act the same way toward him.“Remind me to buy you a copy of the Muggle novel Atlas Shrugged,” thesourceless voice said. “I’m starting to understand what sort of person canbenefit from reading it.”Monday, April 20th, 7:00pm.It happened without any intervention or sign from the Head Table,as the students had finished their subdued dinner; it happened with nopermission or forgiveness asked from the Professors or the Headmaster.Shortly after the dessert dishes had appeared, a student stood up fromthe Slytherin Table and calmly made his way, not to the front of the HeadTable, but toward the opposite side of the Four Tables of Hogwarts. A fewwhispers broke out at the sight of the white-blonde short-cropped hair,as Draco Malfoy stood there, silently regarding all of Hogwarts. DracoMalfoy had said almost nothing since his surprise return. The Slytherinhad condescended neither to confirm nor deny that he had returned because, with Hermione Granger dead at his family’s hand, he no longerhad anything to fear.Then Draco Malfoy took up a spoon in one hand, and a glass of waterin the other, and began tapping, producing a clear ringing sound.Ting.Ting.Ting.It produced more excited babble at first. At the Head Table, the various Professors looked in puzzlement toward the Headmaster in his greatchair, but the Headmaster gave no sign, and so the faculty did nothing.Draco Malfoy continued tapping the spoon upon his glass, until theroom fell silent, waiting.Then another student arose from the Ravenclaw table, and made hisway to where Draco Malfoy was standing, turning to face Hogwarts athis side. Breaths were drawn in surprise; those two should have been thebitterest of enemies—“I, and my Father, the Lord of the Noble and Most Ancient House ofMalfoy,” Draco Malfoy said in a clear voice, “have come to realize thatthere are ill forces at work in Hogwarts. That these ill forces, did wish Hermione Granger harm. That Hermione Granger was perhaps compelled,against her will, to raise her hand against our House; or perhaps she andI were both Memory-Charmed. We now say that whoever dared use theheir of Malfoy so, is the enemy of House Malfoy, upon whom we shall haveour vengeance. And that honor be served, we have returned all moneystaken from House Potter, and canceled all debt.”Then Harry Potter spoke. “House Potter acknowledges that it was anhonest mistake, and holds House Malfoy no ill will. We believe and publicly say that House Malfoy was not at fault in Hermione Granger’s death.Whoever harmed Hermione Granger is the enemy of House Potter, uponwhom we shall have our vengeance. Both of us.”Then Harry Potter began to walk back to the Ravenclaw table, and thebabble of sheer, utter, reality-crashing bewilderment began to explode—Draco Malfoy resumed tapping his spoon against his waterglass, creating a clear ringing chime.Ting.Ting.Ting.And other students arose, from other tables, making their way towhere Draco Malfoy stood, arranging themselves at his side, or behindhim, or before him.There was a dread silence in the Great Hall, a sense of the world shifting, of realigning Powers, almost tangible in the air.“My father, Owen Greengrass, with the consent and full backing of mymother, the Lady of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Greengrass,”Daphne Greengrass spoke.“And my forefather, Charles, of the House of Nott,” said the formerLieutenant Nott, once Theodore of Chaos, now standing behind DracoMalfoy.“And my grand-aunt, Amelia, of the House of Bones, also Director ofthe Department of Magical Law Enforcement,” said Susan Bones, whostood anext Daphne Greengrass, beside whom she had fought.“And my grandmother, Augusta, of the Noble and Most AncientHouse of Longbottom,” said Neville Longbottom, who had returned forthis one night.“And my father, Lucius, the Lord Malfoy, of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy!”“Together with Alanna Howe constituting a majority of the HogwartsBoard of Governors!” Daphne Greengrass said clearly. “Have, to ensurethe safety of all students, including their own children, passed the following Educational Decrees upon the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft andWizardry!”“First!” Daphne said. Daphne was trying to keep her trembling undercontrol, as she faced the Four Houses at the forefront of the five. Therewas only so far her parents’ lessons in speech-making could take her.Daphne’s eyes darted down quickly to her hand, upon which, writtenwith a quill in faint red ink, cues to her lines had been written. “Studentsare not to go anywhere alone, not even to the toilets! You will travelin groups of at least three, and every group must have a sixth-year orseventh-year student!”“Second!” Susan Bones said from behind her, voice almost firm. “Tofurther ensure the students’ safety, nine Aurors have been dispatchedto Hogwarts to form an Auxiliary Protective Force!” Susan took a small,round glass object from within her robes, one of the communicators thatthe DMLE used, which they’d all been given. Susan raised it to her mouthand said, her voice now higher, “Auror Brodski, this is Susan Bones. Enter!”The doors to the Hall slammed open, and in marched nine Aurors inthe reinforced leather gear they used when on duty. At once they spreadout, two Aurors taking up station by each of the four tables, and the lasttook up watch at the Head Table. There were more gasps.“Third!” said Draco Malfoy, his voice commanding. Malfoy had apparently memorized his own lines, since there was nothing written on hishand that Daphne could see. “In the face of a common enemy who doesnot balk at killing students from any House, the four Houses of Hogwartsmust come together and act as one! To emphasize this, the House Pointssystem is temporarily suspended! All Professors will encourage solidaritybetween Houses, by decree of the Hogwarts Board of Governors!”“Fourth!” recited Neville Longbottom. “All students not already inthe Defense Professor’s after-school classes, will receive special trainingin self-defense by Auror instructors!”“Fifth!” Theodore Nott yelled in a menacing tone. “All fighting inthe corridors or anywhere outside of Defense lessons will be dealt withseverely! Fight together or don’t fight at all!”“Sixth!” said Daphne Greengrass, and took a deep breath. When she’dfound out what was planned, she’d made her own little extra request toMother through the Floo. Even with Lucius Malfoy going along withAmelia Bones—a thought her mind was still having trouble grasping—the Greengrass swing vote had still been vital, since Jugson and his ownfaction had refused to back Malfoy. Not to mention that Bones didn’t1610 *trust Malfoy, and Malfoy didn’t trust Bones. So Mother had demanded,and the Greengrasses had received—“Since Memory Charms have beenused on students without setting off wards, it is possible that someoneon the Hogwarts faculty may be implicated. Therefore! The AuxiliaryProtective force reports directly to my father, Lord Greengrass!” And thispart was only symbolic, she knew, there’d be no reason anyone wouldn’tjust contact the Aurors directly; but it might turn into more, someday,which was why she’d asked Mother to demand it—“And if anyone wantsto report something to the Auxiliary Protectors, they can talk to theAurors, or go through me—” Daphne’s arm swept behind her to indicatethe gathered students. “The duly appointed President of the AuxiliaryProtective Special Committee!”And Daphne paused dramatically. They’d all rehearsed this part.“We don’t know who the enemy is,” said Neville, whose voice did notsqueak.“We don’t know what the enemy wants,” said Theodore, still lookingmenacing.“But we know who the enemy is attacking,” said Susan, as fierce aswhen she’d taken on three seventh-year students.“The enemy is attacking Hogwarts students,” said Draco Malfoy, clearand commanding, like all this was his natural element.“And Hogwarts,” spoke Daphne of Greengrass, feeling her blood burnlike it never had before in her life, “is going to fight back.”en days later, the first dead unicorn was found in the Forbidden Forest.1613 *May 13th, 1992.rgus Filch’s face appeared twisted in the light of the oil lamp he held,shadows dancing over his face. Behind them the doors of Hogwartsquickly receded, and the dark grounds moved closer. The track they nowwalked was muddy and indistinct.The trees, branches formerly bare with winter, were not yet fully cladwith spring; their branches stretched up toward the sky like lean fingers,skeletons visible amid the thin foliage. The moon was bright, but cloudsscudding across it often threw them into darkness, lit only by the dimflames of Filch’s lamp.Draco kept a firm grip on his wand.“Where are you taking us?” said Tracey Davis. She’d been caughtalong with Draco by Filch, on their way to an attempted meeting of theSilvery Slytherins after curfew hours, and likewise given a detention.“You just follow me,” said Argus Filch.Draco was feeling rather annoyed with the whole affair. The SilverySlytherins ought to be recognized school business. There was no reasonwhy a secret conspiracy shouldn’t have permission to meet after curfew,if it was for the greater good of Hogwarts. If this happened one moretime he’d talk to Daphne Greengrass and Daphne would talk to her fatherand then Filch would learn the wisdom of looking the other way whereMalfoys were concerned.1615 *The lights of the Hogwarts castle had diminished in the distancewhen Filch spoke again. “I bet you’ll think twice about breaking a schoolrule again, won’t you, eh?” Filch turned his head, away from the lamp,so that he could leer at the four students following him. “Oh yes… hardwork and pain are the best teachers if you ask me… It’s just a pity they letthe old punishments die out… hang you by your wrists from the ceilingfor a few days, I’ve got the chains still in my office, keep ’em well oiled incase they’re ever needed…”“Hey!” Tracey said, a touch of indignation entering her voice. “I’mtoo young to hear about that—that sort of—you know! Especially if thechains are well-oiled!”Draco wasn’t paying attention. Filch simply wasn’t in Amycus Carrow’s league.Behind them, one of the two older Slytherins following them snickered, though she didn’t say anything. Beside her was the other, a tall boywith an Slavic cast to his face, and who still spoke with an accent. They’dbeen caught for some unrelated offense, having to do with the type ofthing Tracey went on about, and looked to be in their third or fourth year.“Pfeh,” said the taller boy. “In Durmstrang they hang you upside-down byyour toes. By one toe, if you are insolent. Hogwarts was soft even in theold days.”Argus Filch was silent for around half a minute, as though trying tothink of a proper rejoinder, and then gave a chuckle. “We’ll see what yousay about that… when you learn what you’ll be doing tonight! Ha!”“I said, I’m too young for that sort of thing!” said Tracey Davis. “It hasto wait until I’m older!”Ahead of them was a cottage with lighted windows, though the proportions seemed wrong.Filch whistled, a high sharp sound, and a dog began barking.From the cottage stepped forth a figure, making the trees seem tooshort around it. The figure was followed by a dog that seemed like a puppyby comparison, until you looked at it apart from the taller silhouette andrealized the dog was huge, more like a wolf.Draco’s eyes narrowed, before he caught himself. As a SilverySlytherin he wasn’t supposed to be Prejudiced against any sentient1616 *being, especially not where other people might see him.“What’s this?” said the figure, in the loud gruff voice of the half-giant.His umbrella lit up with a white glow, brighter than Filch’s dim lamp. Inhis other hand he held a crossbow; a quiver of short bolts was strapped tohis upper arm.“Students serving detention,” Filch said, loudly. “They’re to help yousearch the Forest for… whatever’s been eating ’em.”“The Forest?” gasped Tracey. “We can’t go in there at night!”“That’s right,” said Filch, turning from Hagrid to glare at them. “It’sinto the Forest you’re going, and I’m much mistaken if you’ll all come outin one piece.”“But—” said Tracey. “There’s werewolves, I’ve heard, and vampires,and everyone knows what happens when there’s a girl and a werewolfand a vampire all at the same time!”The huge half-giant was frowning. “Argus, I ’ad in mind you an’maybe a few seventh-years. ’Ere’s not much point in bringing along helpif I’m to watch over ’em the whole time.”Argus’s face lit with cruel satisfaction. “That’s their lookout, isn’tit? Should’ve thought of them werewolves before they got in trouble,shouldn’t they? Send them out alone. I shouldn’t be too friendly to them,Hagrid. They’re here to be punished, after all.”The half-giant gave a massive sigh (it sounded like a normal man having all the air driven out of his lungs by a Bludgeoning Hex). “Yeh’ve doneyer bit. I’ll take over from here.”“I’ll be back at dawn,” said Filch, “for what’s left of them,” he addednastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his lamp bobbing away in the darkness.“Right then,” said Hagrid, “now, listen carefully, ’cause it’s dangerouswhat we’re gonna do tonight an’ I don’ want no one takin’ risks. Followme over here a moment.”He led them to the very edge of the Forest. Holding his lamp up highhe pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into thethick black trees. A light breeze blew over Draco’s head as he looked intothe Forest.1617 *“There’s summat in there that’s bin eatin’ unicorns,” the huge mansaid.Draco nodded; he distantly remembered hearing something alongthose lines a couple of weeks ago, toward the end of April.“Did you call us to track down a trail of silvery blood to a woundedunicorn?” Tracey said excitedly.“No,” said Draco, though he managed to stop the reflexive sneer.“Filch gave us the detention note at lunch today, at noon. Mr. Hagridwouldn’t wait that long to find a wounded unicorn, and if we were looking for something like that, we’d look in the day when it’s bright. So,”Draco held up a finger, like he’d seen Inspector León do in plays, “I inferthat we’re looking for something that only comes out at night.”“Aye,” said the half-giant, sounding thoughtful. “Yer not what I expected, Draco Malfoy. Not what I expected at all. An’ you’d be TraceyDavis, then. I’ve heard of yeh. One of poor Miss Granger’s lot.” RubeusHagrid looked over at the two older Slytherins, peering at them in thelight of his glowing umbrella. “An’ who’d yeh be, again? Don’t rememberseeing much of yeh, boy.”“Cornelia Walt,” said the witch, “and this is Yuri Yuliy,” indicating theSlavic-looking boy who’d spoken of Durmstrang. “His family is visitingfrom the Ukrainian lands, so he’s in Hogwarts just for the year.” The olderboy nodded, a faintly contemptuous cast on his face.“This is Fang,” Hagrid said, indicating the dog.The five of them set off into the woods.“What could be killing unicorns?” Draco said after they’d walked fora few minutes. Draco knew a bit about Dark creatures, but he couldn’tremember anything that was said to prey on unicorns. “What sort of creature does that, does anyone know?”“Werewolves!” said Tracey.“Miss Davis?” Draco said, and when she looked at him, he silentlypointed a finger up at the moon. It was waxing gibbous, but not yet full.“Oh, right,” said Tracey.“No weres in the Forest,” said Hagrid. “They’re plain wizards mosto’ the time, ’member. Couldn’t be wolves either, they’re not near fast1618 *enough ter catch a unicorn. Powerful magical creatures, unicorns are,I never knew one ter be hurt before.”Draco listened to this, thinking about the puzzle almost despite himself. “Then what is fast enough to catch a unicorn?”“Wouldn’t ’ave been a matter of speed,” Hagrid said, giving Draco anindecipherable glance. “Ere’s no end ter the ways that creatures hunt. Poison, darkness, traps. Imps as can’t be seen or heard or remembered, evenwhile they’re eatin’ yer face. Always summat new an’ wonderful to learn.”A cloud passed over the moon, casting the forest into shadow lit onlyby the glow of Hagrid’s umbrella.“Meself,” Hagrid continued, “I think we might ’ave a Parisian hydraon our ’ands. They’re no threat to a wizard, yeh’ve just got to keep holdin’’em off long enough, and there’s no way yeh can lose. I mean literally noway yeh can lose so long’s yeh keep fightin’. Trouble is, against a Parisianhydra, most creatures give up long before. Takes a while to cut down allthe heads, yeh see.”“Bah,” said the foreign boy. “In Durmstrang we learn to fight Buchholz hydra. Unimaginably more tedious to fight! I mean literally, cannotimagine. First-years not believe us when we tell them winning is possible!Instructor must give second order, iterate until they comprehend.”They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the Forest, until the path became almost impossible to follow because the treeswere so thick.Then Draco saw it, thick splashes on the roots of trees, gleaming abrighter color beneath the moonlight. “Is that—”“Unicorn’s blood,” Hagrid said. The huge man’s voice was sad.In a clearing ahead, visible through the tangled branches of a greatoak, they saw the fallen creature, splayed beautiful and sad upon theground, the dirt around her shining moon-silver with pooled blood. Theunicorn was not white, but pale blue, or appearing so beneath the moonand night sky. Her slender legs stuck out at odd angles, obviously broken, and her mane spread across the dark leaves, green-black but with asheen like pearls. On her flank was a small white shape like a starburst, acenter surrounded by eight straight rays. Half her side had been ripped1619 *away, the edges ragged like the marks of teeth, bones and inner organsexposed.A strange choking sensation rose in Draco’s throat.“That’s ’er,” Hagrid said, his sad whisper as loud as a normal man’svoice. “Just where I found ’er this mornin’, dead as a dead doorknob. Sheis—was—the first unicorn I e’er met in these woods. I called ’er Alicorn,not that it matters ter ’er any more, I s’pose.”“You named a unicorn Alicorn,” said the older girl. Her voice was a bitdry.“But she doesn’t have wings,” Tracey said.“An alicorn’s a unicorn’s horn,” Hagrid said, now louder. “Don’t knowwhere yeh all started thinking it meant a unicorn with wings, ’ere’s nosuch thing I ever heard. It’s just like naming a dog Fang,” indicating thehuge wolf-like dog that barely came to his knees. “What’d you have called’er? Hannah, or some such? I gave ’er a name as would’ve meant summatter ’er. Common courtesy, I call it.”Nobody said anything to this, and after a further moment, the hugeman gave a sharp nod. “We’ll start our search from ’ere, the last place itstruck. We’re gonna split inter two parties an’ follow the trail in diff’rentdirections. Yeh two, Walt and Yuliy—yeh’ll go that way, and take Fang.There’s nothin’ that lives in the Forest that’ll hurt yeh if yer with Fang.Send up green sparks if yeh find summat interestin’, an’ send up redsparks if anyone gets in trouble. Davis, Malfoy, with me.”The Forest was black and silent. Rubeus Hagrid had dimmed the lightof his umbrella after they’d set out, so that Draco and Tracey had to steerthemselves by the light of the moon, not without occasional trips and falls.They walked past a mossy tree-stump, the sound of running water speaking of a stream somewhere close by. Now and then a ray of moonlightthrough the branches above lit a spot of silver blue blood on the fallenleaves; they were following the trail of blood, toward where the creaturemust have first struck the unicorn.“There’s rumors about yeh,” Hagrid said in a low voice after they’dwalked for a while.“Well, they’re all true,” Tracey said. “All of them.”“Not yeh,” Hagrid said. “Did yeh really testify under Veritaserum thatyeh tried to help Miss Granger, three times it was?”Draco weighed his words for a while, and finally said, “Yes.” Itwouldn’t have done to appear too eager to claim credit.The huge man shook his head, his great feet still stomping silentlythrough the woods. “I’m surprised, teh be honest. And yeh too, Davis,tryin’ to put the halls in order. Are yeh sure the Sorting Hat put yeh inthe right place? There’s not a single witch or wizard who went bad whowasn’t in Slytherin, so it’s always been said.”“That’s not true,” Tracey said. “What about Xiaonan Tong the BlackRaven, Spencer of the Hill, and Mister Kayvon?”“Who?” said Hagrid.“Just some of the best Dark Wizards from the last two centuries,”Tracey said. “They’re probably the best from Hogwarts who weren’t fromSlytherin.” Her voice fell, lost its enthusiasm. “Miss Granger always toldme I should read up on anything I—”“Anyway,”Draco said quickly, “that’s not really relevant, Mr. Hagrid.Even if—” Draco worked it around in his head, trying to translate the difference between probability of Slytherin given Dark and probability of Darkgiven Slytherin into nonscientific language. “Even if most Dark Wizardsare from Slytherin, very few Slytherins are Dark Wizards. There aren’tall that many Dark Wizards, so not all Slytherins can be one.” Or as Father had said, while any Malfoy should certainly know much of the secretlore, the more… costly rituals were better left to useful fools like AmycusCarrow.“So yeh’re saying,” Hagrid said, “that most Dark Wizards areSlytherins… but…”“But most Slytherins are not Dark Wizards,” Draco said. He had aweary feeling they’d be at this a while, but like fighting a hydra, the important thing was to not give up.“I never thought of it that way,” the huge man said, soundingawestruck. “But, well, if yeh’re not all a house of snakes, then why—getbehind that tree!”Hagrid seized Draco and Tracey and hoisted them off the path behinda towering oak. He pulled out a bolt and fitted it into his crossbow, raising1621 *it, ready to fire. The three of them listened. Something was slitheringover dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground.Hagrid was squinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the soundfaded away.“I knew it,” Hagrid murmured. “There’s summat in here that shouldn’be.”They went after where the rustling sound had come from, with Hagrid in the lead and Tracey and Draco both gripping their wands at theready, but they found nothing, despite searching in a widening circlewith their ears straining for the faintest sound.They walked on through the dense, dark trees. Draco kept lookingover his shoulder, a feeling nagging at him that they were being watched.They had just passed a bend in the path when Tracey yelled and pointed.In the distance, a shower of red sparks lit the air.“You two wait here!” Hagrid shouted. “Stay where yeh are, I’ll comeback for yeh!”Before Draco could say a word, Hagrid spun and crashed awaythrough the undergrowth.Draco and Tracey stood looking at each other, until they heard nothing but the rustling of leaves around them. Tracey looked scared, but trying to hide it. Draco was feeling more annoyed than anything else. Apparently Rubeus Hagrid, when he had formed his plans for tonight, hadnot spent even five seconds visualizing the consequences if somethingactually went wrong.“Now what?” said Tracey, her voice a little high.“We wait for Mr. Hagrid to come back.”The minutes dragged by. Draco’s ears seemed sharper than usual,picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig. Tracey kept looking up at the moon, as though to reassure herself that it wasn’t full yet.“I’m—” Tracey whispered. “I’m getting a little nervous, Mr. Malfoy.”Draco thought about it a bit. To be honest, there was something… well,it wasn’t that he was a coward, or even that he was scared. But there hadbeen a murder at Hogwarts and if he’d been watching himself in a play,having just been abandoned in the Forbidden Forest by a half-giant, hewould currently feel like yelling at the boy on stage that he should…Draco reached into his robes, and took out a mirror. Tapping the surface showed a man in red robes, who frowned almost immediately.“Auror Captain Eneasz Brodski,” the man said clearly, causing Traceyto start with the loudness in the quiet forest. “What is it, Draco Malfoy?”“Put me on ten-minute check-in,” Draco said. He’d decided not tocomplain directly about his detention. He did not want to look like aspoiled brat. “If I don’t respond, come get me. I’m in the Forbidden Forest.”Inside the mirror, the Auror’s brows rose. “What are you doing in theForbidden Forest, Mr. Malfoy?”“Looking for the unicorn-eater with Mr. Hagrid,” Draco said, andtapped the mirror off, putting it back in his robes before the Aurorcould ask anything about detentions or say anything about serving it outwithout complaining.Tracey’s head turned toward him, though it was a little too dim to readher expression. “Um, thanks,” she whispered.The few leaves which had emerged on their branches rustled as another, colder breeze blew through the forest.Tracey’s voice was a little louder when she spoke again. “You didn’thave to—” she said, now sounding a little shy.“Don’t mention it, Miss Davis.”The dark silhouette of Tracey put her hand to her cheek, as though toconceal a blush that wasn’t visible anyway. “I mean, not for me—”“No, really,” Draco said. “Don’t mention it. At all.” He would havethreatened to take out the mirror and order Captain Brodski not to rescueher, but he was afraid she would consider that flirting.Tracey’s silhouetted head turned from him, looked away. Finally shesaid, in a smaller voice, “It’s too soon, isn’t it—”A high scream echoed through the woods, a not-quite-human sound,the scream of something like a horse; and Tracey shrieked and ran.“No, you numbskull!” yelled Draco, plunging after her. The soundhad been so eerie that Draco wasn’t certain where it came from—but hethought that Tracey Davis might, in fact, be running straight toward thesource of that eerie scream.Brambles whipped at Draco’s eyes, he had to keep one hand in frontof his face to shield them, trying not to lose track of Tracey because itseemed obvious that, if this was a play, and they got separated, one ofthem was going to die. Draco thought of the mirror secured within hisrobes but he somehow knew that if he tried to take it out one-handedwhile running, the mirror would inevitably fall and be lost—Ahead of them, Tracey had stopped, and Draco felt relieved for an instant, before he saw.Another unicorn lay on the ground, surrounded by a slowly wideningpool of silver blood, the edge of the blood creeping across the ground likespilled mercury. Her coat was purple, like the color of the night sky, herhorn exactly the same twilight color as her skin, her visible flank markedby a pink star-blotch surrounded by white patches. The sight tore atDraco’s heart, even more than the other unicorn because this one’s eyeswere staring glassily right at him, and because there was a——blurring, twisting form——feeding on an open wound on the unicorn’s side, like it was drinking from it——Draco couldn’t understand, somehow couldn’t recognize what hewas seeing——it was looking at them.The blurring, seething, unrecognizable darkness seemed to turn to regard them. A hiss came from it, like the hiss of the deadliest snake whichever had existed, something more dangerous by far than any Blue Krait.Then it bent back over the wound in the unicorn, and continued todrink.The mirror was in Draco’s hand, and it remained lifeless as his fingermechanically tapped at the surface, over and over.Tracey was holding her wand now, saying things like “Prismatis” and“Stupefy” but nothing was happening.Then the seething outline rose up, like a man rising to his feet onlynot so; and it seemed to scuttle forward, moving with a strange half-jumpacross the dying unicorn’s legs, approaching the two of them.Tracey tugged at his sleeve and then turned to run, run from something that could hunt down unicorns. Before she could take three stepsthere came another terrible hiss, burning his ears, and Tracey fell to theground and did not move.Somewhere in the back of his mind, Draco knew that he was about todie. Even if the Auror checked his mirror this very instant, there was noway anyone could get here fast enough. There was no time.Running hadn’t worked.Magic hadn’t worked.The seething outline came closer, while Draco tried, in his last moments, to solve the riddle.Then a blazing silver ball of light plunged out of the night sky andhung there, illuminating the forest as bright as daylight, and the seethingoutline leapt backwards, as though in horror of the light.Four broomsticks plunged out of the sky, three Aurors with brightmulticolored shields and Harry Potter holding his wand aloft, seated behind Professor McGonagall within a larger shield.“Get out of here!” roared Professor McGonagall——an instant before the seething thing gave forth another terrible hiss, and allthe shielding spells winked out. The three Aurors and Professor McGonagall felloff their broomsticks and dropped heavily to the forest floor, lying motionless.Draco couldn’t breathe, the most intense fear he’d ever felt in his life grippingall through his chest, sending tendrils around his heart.Harry Potter, who had remained untouched, silently guided his broomsticktoward the ground——and then leapt off to stand between Draco and the seething outline, interposing himself like a living shield.“Run!” said Harry Potter, turning his head half-back to look at Draco. Thesilver moonlight gleamed on his face. “Run, Draco! I’ll hold it off!”“You can’t fight that thing alone!” Draco cried aloud. A nausea was in hisstomach, a churning sensation that, looking back in memory, seemed both likeand unlike a sense of guilt, as though it had the sensations but not quite all of theemotion.“I must,” Harry Potter said grimly. “Go!”“Harry, I—I’m sorry, for everything—I” Though later, looking back, Dracocouldn’t quite remember what he’d meant to apologize for, maybe it’d been that hewas planning to overthow Harry’s conspiracy, all that time ago.The seething figure, now seeming blacker and more terrible, rose up into theair, hovering off the ground.“GO!” shouted Harry.Draco turned and fled headlong into the woods,with the branches whipping athis face. Behind him, Draco heard another terrible hiss, and Harry’s voice rising,crying something that Draco couldn’t make out from the distance; Draco turnedhis head for only an instant to look back, and in that moment ran into something,hitting his head HARD, and blacked out.Harry held a tight grip on his wand, a Prismatic Sphere glowing aroundhim. He stared levelly at the seething, blurring form in front of him, andsaid, “What on Earth are you doing?”The seething blurs resolved, reformed, relaxed back into a hoodedform. Whatever concealment had been at work—a device rather than aCharm, Harry guessed, since the magic had been able to affect him—hadprevented his mind from recognizing the shape or even that the shapewas human. But it hadn’t prevented Harry from recognizing the sharpsense of doom.Professor Quirrell stood straight with silver blood all down the frontof his enshrouding black cloak, and gave a sigh, looking at the fallenforms of three Aurors, Tracey Davis, Draco Malfoy, and Professor McGonagall. “I had honestly thought,” Professor Quirrell murmured, “that Ijammed that mirror without alarm. What were two first-year Slytherinsdoing alone in the Forbidden Forest? Mr. Malfoy has more sense thanthis… What a fiasco.”Harry didn’t answer. The sense of doom was as strong as Harry couldever remember feeling it, a feeling of power in the air so great that it wasalmost tangible. Some part of him was still viscerally shocked at how fastthe shields surrounding the Aurors had been torn apart. He almost hadn’tbeen able to see the successive lashes of color which had torn away theshields like tissue paper. It made the duel Professor Quirrell had foughtagainst the Auror in Azkaban look like a mockery, a child’s game—thoughProfessor Quirrell had claimed, then, that if he’d fought for real the Aurorwould have been dead in seconds; and Harry knew now that this was alsotrue.Just how high did the power ladder go?“I take it,” Harry said, managing to keep his voice steady, “that youreating unicorns has something to do with why you’ll get fired from theDefense Professor position. I don’t suppose you’d care to explain in considerable detail?”Professor Quirrell looked at him. The almost tangible sense of powerin the air seemed to diminish, drawing back into the Defense Professor.“I shall indeed explain myself,” the Defense Professor said. “I need to casta few Memory Charms first, and then we may go off and discuss it, for itwould not be wise for me to stay. You will return to this time later, as Iknow.”Harry willed himself to be able to see through the Cloak he had mastered; and knew that another Harry stood beside him, hidden by his ownDeathly Hallow. Harry then told his Cloak to hide himself from himselfonce more, and it did; being able to perceive your future self meant having to match the memory later.Harry’s own voice said, then, sounding strange in present-Harry’sears, “He has a surprisingly good explanation.”Present-Harry remembered the words as best he could. Nothingmore was said between them.Professor Quirrell walked to Draco’s form, and chanted the spell of theFalse Memory Charm. The Defense Professor stood there for perhaps aminute, seemingly lost to the world.Harry had been studying Obliviations, these last couple of weeks—though he couldn’t have helped cast the spells, unless he was willing toexhaust himself almost completely, and for some reason they wanted anAuror to lose every single life memory involving the color blue. But Harryhad some idea, now, of the concentration which the far more difficultFalse Memory Charm entailed. You had to try to live the other person’sentire life inside your own head, at least if you wanted to create the FalseMemories with less than a sixteen-to-one slowdown as you separatelycrafted sixteen major tracks of memory. It might have been quiet, theremight have been no outward sign; but Harry knew something of the difficulties now, and he knew to be impressed.Professor Quirrell finished, and moved on to Tracey Davis, then thethree Aurors, and finally Professor McGonagall. Harry waited, but futureHarry made no protest. It was possible that even Professor McGonagall,if she’d been awake, wouldn’t have protested. It was not yet the Ides ofMay, and apparently there would be a surprisingly good explanation.With a gesture, Draco’s stunned body was lifted, and sent a short distance into the woods, before being carefully deposited on the ground.Then a final gesture from Professor Quirrell ripped a huge chunk out ofthe unicorn’s side, leaving behind ragged edges; the raw meat hovered inthe air, then wavered in Vanishment and was gone.“Done,” Professor Quirrell said. “I must depart this place now,Mr. Potter. Come with me, and remain here.”Professor Quirrell strode away, and Harry followed and remained behind.They walked through the woods in silence for a time, before Harryheard faint voices in the distance. The next set of Aurors, presumably,after the first set had fallen out of contact. What his future self was saying,Harry didn’t know.“They won’t detect us, nor hear our speech,” said Professor Quirrell.The sense of power and doom around the Defense Professor was stillstrong. The man seated himself on a tree stump, one where the lightof the almost-full moon fell full on him. “I should first say that whenyou speak to the Aurors, in the future, you should tell them that youfrightened away the seething dark, the same as you did that Dementor.It is what Mr. Malfoy will remember seeing.” Professor Quirrell gave asmall sigh. “It may cause some alarm, if they conclude that some horrorkin to Dementors, and strong enough to break the Aurors’ shields, isloose in the Forbidden Forest. But I could not think of what else to do. Ifthe forest is better-guarded after this—but with any luck I have alreadyconsumed what I need. Would you mind telling me how you arrived soquickly? How did you know Mr. Malfoy was in trouble?”After Captain Brodski had learned that Draco Malfoy was in the Forbidden Forest, seemingly in the company of Rubeus Hagrid, Brodski hadbegun inquiring to find out who had authorized this, and had still beenunable to find out when Draco Malfoy had missed check-in. DespiteHarry’s protests, the Auror Captain, who was authorized to know aboutTime-Turners, had refused to allow deployment to before the time of themissed check-in; there were standard procedures involving Time. ButBrodski had given Harry written orders allowing him to go back anddeploy an Auror trio to arrive one second after the missed check-in time.There had been a Patronus Charm to locate Draco, which Harry hadsuccessfully willed to take the form of a ball of pure silver light, and theflight of Aurors had arrived on time to the second.“I’m afraid I couldn’t say,” Harry replied evenly. Professor Quirrellwas still a major suspect, and it was good for him not to know the details.“Now why are you eating unicorns?”“Ah,” Professor Quirrell said. “As to that…” The man hesitated. “I wasdrinking the blood of unicorns, not eating them. The missing flesh, theragged marks upon the body—those were to obscure the case, to makeit seem like some other predator. The use of unicorn’s blood is too wellknown.”“I don’t know it,” Harry said.“I know you do not,” the Defense Professor said sharply. “Or youwould not be pestering me about it. The power of unicorn’s blood is topreserve your life for a time, even if you are on the very verge of death.”There was a stretch of time when Harry’s brain claimed to be refusingto process the words, which was of course a lie, because you couldn’t knowthe meaning you weren’t allowed to process, without having already processed it.A strange sense of blankness overtook Harry, an absence of reaction,maybe this was what other people felt like when someone went off-script,and they couldn’t say or think of anything to do.Of course Professor Quirrell was dying, not just occasionally ill.Professor Quirrell had known he was dying. He’d volunteered to takethe Defense Professor position at Hogwarts, after all.Of course he’d been getting worse the whole school year. Of courseillnesses which kept getting worse had a predictable destination at theirend.Harry’s brain had surely known already, somewhere in the safeback of his mind where he could refuse to process things he’d alreadyprocessed.Of course that was why Professor Quirrell wouldn’t be able to teachBattle Magic next year. Professor McGonagall wouldn’t even have to firehim. He would just be——dead.“No,” Harry said, his voice a little shaky. “There has to be a way—”“I am not stupid nor particularly eager to die. I have already looked. Ihad to go this far simply to last out my lesson plans, having less time thanI had thought, and—” The head of the dark moonlit figure turned away.“I think I do not want to hear about it, Mr. Potter.”Harry’s breath hitched. Too many emotions were bubbling up in himat once. After denial came anger, according to a ritual someone had justmade up. And yet it seemed surprisingly appropriate.“And why—” Harry’s breath hitched again. “Why isn’t unicorn’s bloodstandard in healer’s kits, then? To keep someone alive, even if they’re onthe very verge of dying from their legs being eaten?”“Because there are permanent side effects,” Professor Quirrell saidquietly.“Side effects? Side effects? What kind of side effect is medically worsethan DEATH?” Harry’s voice rose on the last word until he was shouting.“Not everyone thinks the same way we do, Mr. Potter. Though, to befair, the blood must come from a live unicorn and the unicorn must diein the drinking. Would I be here otherwise?”Harry turned, stared at the surrounding trees. “Have a herd of unicorns at St. Mungos. Floo the patients there, or use portkeys.”“Yes, that would work.”Harry’s face tightened, the only outward sign behind his tremblinghands of everything that was welling up inside him. He needed to scream,needed some outlet, needed something he couldn’t name and finally Harryleveled his wand at a tree and shouted “Diffindo!”There was a sharp tearing sound, and a cut appeared across the wood.“Diffindo!”Another cut. Harry had learned the Charm only ten days previously,after he’d started getting serious about self-defense. It was theoretically asecond-year Charm, but the anger pouring through him seemed to knowno bounds, he knew enough now not to exhaust himself and he still hadpower yet.“Diffindo!” Harry had aimed at a branch this time, and it plummetedto the ground with a sound of twigs and leaves.There didn’t seem to be any tears inside him, only pressure with nooutlet.“I shall leave you to it,” Professor Quirrell said quietly. The DefenseProfessor rose from his tree stump, the unicorn’s blood still moonlit onthe black cloak he wore, and drew his hood back over his head.1631 *arry stood, panting, in the midst of a brief wasted circle amid theforest, more destruction than a first-year should have been able toreach, by himself. The Severing Charm wouldn’t bring down a tree, sohe’d started partially Transfiguring cross-sections through the wood. Ithadn’t let out what was inside him, bringing down a small circle of treeshadn’t made him feel any better, all the emotions were still there but whilehe was destroying trees he at least wasn’t thinking about how the feelingscouldn’t be let out.After Harry had run out of available magic he’d started tearing offbranches with his bare hands and snapping them. His hands were bleeding, though nothing that Madam Pomfrey couldn’t fix in the morning.Only Dark magic left permanent scars on wizards.There came a sound of something moving in the woods, like the hoofbeats of a horse, and Harry whirled, his wand rising once more; somepart of his magic had returned while he was working with his hands. Itoccurred to him for the first time that he was out in the Forbidden Forestalone, and making noise.What emerged into the moonlight was not the unicorn Harry had expected, but a creature with a lower body like that of a horse, gleamingwhite-brown beneath the moonlight, and the bare upper chest of a malehuman with long white hair. The moonlight caught the centaur’s face,and Harry saw that the eyes were almost as blue as Dumbledore’s, halfwayto sapphire.In one hand the centaur held a long wooden spear, with an overlargemetal blade whose edge did not gleam beneath the moonlight; a gleamingedge, Harry had once read, was the sign of a dull blade.“So,” the centaur said. His voice was low, powerful and male. “Hereyou are, surrounded by destruction. I can smell the unicorn’s blood in theair, the blood of something innocent, slain to save oneself.”A jolt of sudden fear brought Harry into the now, and he said quickly,“It’s not what it looks like.”“I know. The stars themselves proclaim your innocence, ironicallyenough.” The centaur took a step toward Harry within the small clearing, still holding his spear upright. “A strange word, innocence. It meanslack of knowledge, like the innocence of a child, and also means lack ofguilt. Only those entirely ignorant can lack all responsibility for the consequences of their actions. He knows not what he does, and thereforecan be without harmful intent; so says that word.” The deep voice did notecho in the woods.Harry’s eyes flickered to the spear-tip, and he realized that he shouldhave grabbed his Time-Turner the moment he saw the centaur. Now, ifHarry tried to reach beneath his robes, the spear could strike him beforethen, if the centaur was fast enough. “I read once,” Harry said, his voice abit unsteady as he tried to match deep-sounding words to deep-soundingwords, “that it’s wrong to think of little children as innocent, because notknowing isn’t the same as not choosing. That children do little harms toeach other with schoolyard fights, because they don’t have the power todo great harm. And some adults do great harm. But the adults who don’t,aren’t they more innocent than children, not less?”“The wisdom of wizards,” the centaur said.“Muggle wisdom, actually.”“Of the magicless I know little. Mars has been dim of late, but it growsbrighter.” The centaur took another step forwards, bringing him almostwithin striking distance of Harry.Harry didn’t dare look up to the sky. “That means Mars is comingcloser to the Earth, as both planets go around the Sun. Mars is reflectingthe same amount of sunlight as always, it’s just getting nearer to us. Whatdo you mean, the stars proclaim my innocence?”“The night sky speaks to centaurs. It is how we know what we know.Or do they not even tell wizards that much, these days?” A look of contempt crossed the centaur’s face.“I… tried to look up centaurs, when I was checking out Divination.Most of the authors just ridiculed centaur Divination without explainingwhy, wizards don’t understand argumentative norms, to them ridiculingan idea or a person feels like casting that idea down just as much as bringing evidence against it… I thought the part about centaurs using astrologywas just more ridicule…”“Why?” the centaur intoned. His head cocked curiously.“Because the course of the planets is predictable for thousands ofyears in advance. If I talked to the right Muggles, I could show you adiagram of exactly what the planets will look like from this spot ten yearslater. Would you be able to make predictions from that?”The centaur shook his head. “From a diagram? No. The light of theplanets, the comets, the subtle shifts in the stars themselves, those Iwould not see.”“Cometary orbits are also set thousands of years in advance so theyshouldn’t correlate much to current events. And the light of the starstakes years to travel from the stars to Earth, and the stars don’t movemuch at all, not visibly. So the obvious hypothesis is that centaurs have anative magical talent for Divination which you just, well, project onto thenight sky.”“Perhaps,” the centaur said thoughtfully. His head lowered. “The others would strike you for saying such a thing, but I have ever sought toknow what I do not know. Why the night sky can foretell the future—that I surely do not know. It is hard enough to grasp the skill itself. All Ican say, son of Lily, is that even if what you are saying is true, it does notseem useful.”Harry allowed himself to relax a little; being addressed as ‘son of Lily’implied that the centaur thought of him as more than a random intruderin the forest. Besides, attacking a Hogwarts student would probablybring some kind of huge reprisal upon the non-wizard centaur tribe inthe forests, and the centaur probably knew that… “What Muggles havelearned is that there is a power in the truth, in all the pieces of the truthwhich interact with each other, which you can only find by discoveringas many truths as possible. To do that you can’t defend false beliefs inany way, not even by saying the false belief is useful. It might not seemto matter whether your predictions are really based on the stars or if it’san innate talent being projected. But if you wanted to really understandDivination, or for that matter the stars, the real truth about centaurpredictions would be a fact that matters to other truths.”Slowly the centaur nodded. “So the wandless have become wiser thanthe wizards. What a joke! Tell me, son of Lily, do the Muggles in theirwisdom say that soon the skies will be empty?”“Empty?” Harry said. “Er… no?”“The other centaurs in this forest have stayed from your presence, forwe are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens’ course. Because, inbecoming entangled in your fate, we might become less innocent in whatis to come. I alone have dared approach you.”“I… don’t understand.”“No. You are innocent, as the stars say. And to slay something innocent to save oneself, that is a terrible deed. One would live only a cursedlife, a half-life, from that day. For any centaur would surely be cast out, ifhe slew a foal.”The spear made a lightning motion, too fast for Harry’s eyes to follow,and smashed his wand out of his hand.Another powerful blow smashed into Harry’s solar plexus, and hewent gasping and retching to the forest floor.Harry’s hand reached up toward his robes, for his Time-Turner, andthe spear-butt knocked his hand away, almost hard enough to break fingers, he reached with his other hand and that was knocked away too—“I am sorry, Harry Potter,” the centaur said, and then looked up withwidened eyes. The spear spun about and came up, intercepting a red spellbolt. Then the centaur dropped the spear and leaped away desperately, agreen flash of light went past him and another green flash of light followed in its wake, then a third green flash hit the centaur straight-on.The centaur fell and did not move again.It took a long time for Harry to catch his breath, to stagger to his feet,to pick up his wand, to croak, “What?”By that time the sense of doom, of power almost tangible in the air,had approached once more.“P-Professor Quirrell? What are you doing here?”“Well,” the man in the black cloak said thoughtfully, “you needed to flyinto a rage and have a loud tantrum in the Forbidden Forest in the middleof the night, and I needed to go just outside your ability to detect me andkeep watch. One does not leave a student alone in the Forbidden Forest.That should be obvious in retrospect.”Harry stared at the fallen centaur.The horse-form wasn’t breathing.“You—you killed him, that was Avada Kedavra—”“I do not always understand how other people imagine morality towork, Mr. Potter. But even I know that on conventional morality, it isacceptable to kill nonhuman creatures which are about to slay a wizardchild. Perhaps you do not care about the nonhuman part, but he wasabout to kill you. He was hardly innocent—”The Defense Professor stopped, looking at Harry, who had raised onetrembling hand to his mouth.“Well,” the Defense Professor said then, “I have made my point, andyou may think on it. Centaur spears can block many spells, but no onetries to block if they see that the spell is a certain shade of green. For thispurpose it is useful to know some green stunning hexes. Really, Mr. Potter, you should understand by now how I operate.”The Defense Professor came nearer the centaur’s body, and Harrytook an involuntary step back, then another, at the terrible rising senseof STOP, DON’T—The Defense Professor kneeled and pressed his wand to the centaur’shead.The wand stayed there for a time.And the centaur rose, eyes blank, breathing once more.“Remember nothing of this time,” the Defense Professor commanded.“Wander away and forget everything about this night.”The centaur walked away, the four horse-legs moving in strange synchrony.“Happy now?” the Defense Professor said, sounding rather sardonicabout it.Harry’s brain still felt broken. “He was trying to kill me.”“Oh, for Merlin’s sake—yes, he was trying to kill you. Get used to it.Only boring people never have that experience.”Harry’s voice emerged, hoarse. “Why—why did he want to—”“Any number of reasons. I would be lying if I said I’d never consideredkilling you myself.”Harry stared at where the centaur had wandered into the trees.His brain still felt half-broken, like an engine misfiring, but Harry didnot see how this could possibly be a good sign.The news of Draco Malfoy nearly being eaten by a horror had been sufficient to summon back Dumbledore from wherever he’d gone, to wakeLord Malfoy and the Lady Greengrass’s handsome husband, to bringforth Amelia Bones. The supposed presence of the horror had provokedskepticism even from Dumbledore, and the possibility of False MemoryCharms had been raised. Harry had said (after some internal debateabout the consequences of people believing a demon was on the loose)that he didn’t actually remember making the same effort he’d put forthto frighten the Dementor, the dark thing had just left; which was whatyou would expect someone to create as a False Memory, if they hadn’tactually known how Harry had done it. The names of Bellatrix Black,Severus Snape, and Quirinus Quirrell had been mentioned in connection with wizards strong enough to subdue everyone present and castFalse Memory Charms, and Harry had known that Lucius was thinkingof Dumbledore. There had been Aurors testifying, and discussions goingin circles, and glares of accusation, and cutting remarks at 2am in themorning. There had been motions, and votes, and consequences.“Do you believe,” Headmaster Dumbledore said quietly to Harry,when all of it was done, and the two of them alone, “that the Hogwartsyou have wrought is an improvement?”Harry sat with his elbows on his knees, his face resting on his palms,in the conference room from which all the others had now departed. Professor McGonagall, who did not use a Time-Turner as routinely as the twoof them, had departed swiftly for her bed.“Yes,” Harry answered after too long a hesitation. “From my perspective, Headmaster, things in Hogwarts are finally, finally normal. This ishow things should be, when four children get sent into the Forbidden Forest at night. There should be a huge fuss, constables showing up, and theresponsible party getting sacked.”“You believe it is good,” Dumbledore said quietly, “that the man whoyou call responsible was, as you put it, sacked.”“Yes, in fact, I do.”“Argus Filch has served this institution for decades.”“And when given Veritaserum,” Harry said tiredly, “Argus Filch revealed that he had sent an eleven-year-old boy into the Forbidden Forest, hoping something awful would happen to him, because he thoughtthe boy’s father had been responsible for the death of his cat. The threeother students in Draco’s company don’t seem to have fazed him. I wouldhave argued for jail time, but your concept of jail in this country is Azkaban. I’ll also note that Filch was remarkably unpleasant to the children inHogwarts and I expect the school’s hedonic index to be improved by hisdeparture, not that it matters to you, I suppose.”The Headmaster’s eyes were impenetrable behind the half-moonglasses. “Argus Filch is a Squib. His work at Hogwarts is all he has. Had,rather.”“The purpose of a school is not to provide work for its employees. Iknow you probably spent more time around Filch than around any individual student, but that shouldn’t make Filch’s inner experiences loomlarger in your thoughts. Students have inner lives too.”“You don’t care at all, do you Harry?” Dumbledore’s voice was quiet.“About those you hurt.”“I care about the innocent,” Harry said. “Like Mr. Hagrid, who you’llnote I argued should not be considered malicious, just oblivious. I wasfine with Mr. Hagrid working here so long as he didn’t take anyone intothe Forbidden Forest again.”“I had thought that with Rubeus vindicated, he might teach Care ofMagical Creatures after Silvanus departs the position. But much of thatteaching is done in the Forbidden Forest. So that too shall not be, in thewake of your passage.”Harry said slowly, “But—you told us that Mr. Hagrid has a blind spotwhen it comes to magical creatures threatening wizards. That Mr. Hagrid had a cognitive deficit and couldn’t really imagine Draco and Traceygetting hurt, which was why Mr. Hagrid didn’t see anything wrong withleaving them alone in the Forbidden Forest at night. Was that not true?”“It is true.”“Then wouldn’t Mr. Hagrid be the worst possible teacher for MagicalCreatures?”The old wizard gazed down at Harry through the half-moon glasses.His voice was thick when he spoke. “Mr. Malfoy himself saw nothingawry. It was not so implausible a trick which Argus played, Harry Potter.And Rubeus might have grown into his position. It would have been—allRubeus wished, his one greatest desire—”“Your mistake,” Harry said, looking down at his knees, feeling at leastten percent as exhausted as he’d ever been, “is a cognitive bias we wouldcall, in the trade, scope insensitivity. Failure to multiply. You’re thinkingabout how happy Mr. Hagrid would be when he heard the news. Considerthe next ten years and a thousand students taking Magical Creatures andten percent of them being scalded by Ashwinders. No one student wouldbe hurt as much as Mr. Hagrid would be happy, but there’d be a hundredstudents being hurt and only one happy teacher.”“Perhaps,” the old wizard said. “And your own error, Harry, is thatyou do not feel the pain of those you hurt, once you have done your multiplication.”“Maybe.” Harry went on staring at his knees. “Or maybe it’s worsethan that. Headmaster, what does it mean if a centaur doesn’t like me?”What does it mean when a member of a race of magical creatures known for Divination gives you a lecture on people who are ignorant of consequences, apologizes,and then tries to stab you with a spear?“A centaur?” the Headmaster said. “When did you—ah, the TimeTurner. You are the reason why I could not travel back to before the event,on pain of paradox.”“Am I? I guess I am.” Harry shook his head distantly. “Sorry.”“With very few exceptions,” Dumbledore said, “centaurs do not likewizards, at all.”“This was a bit more specific than that.”“What did the centaur say to you?”Harry didn’t reply.“Ah.” The Headmaster hesitated. “Centaurs have been wrong manytimes, and if there is anyone in the world who could confuse the starsthemselves, it is you.”Harry looked up, and saw the blue eyes once more gentle behind thehalf-circle glasses.“Do not fret too much about it,” said Albus Dumbledore.1641 *June 3rd, 1992.rofessor Quirrell was very sick.He’d seemed better for a while, after drinking his unicorn’s bloodin May, but the air of intense power which had surrounded him afterwardhadn’t lasted even a day. By the Ides of May, Professor Quirrell’s handshad been trembling again, though subtly. The Defense Professor’s medical regimen had been interrupted too early, it seemed.Six days ago Professor Quirrell had collapsed at dinnertime.Madam Pomfrey had tried to forbid Professor Quirrell from teachingclasses, and Professor Quirrell had shouted at her in front of everyone.The Defense Professor had shouted that he was dying regardless, andwould use his remaining time as he chose.So Madam Pomfrey, blinking hard, had forbidden the Defense Professor from doing anything except teaching his classes. She’d asked for avolunteer to help her take Professor Quirrell to a room in the Hogwartsinfirmary. More than a hundred students had risen to their feet, only halfwearing green.The Defense Professor no longer sat at the Head Table during mealtimes. He didn’t cast spells during lessons. The oldest students who hadthe most Quirrell points helped him to teach, the seventh-years who hadalready sat their Defense N.E.W.T.s in May. They took turns floating himfrom his room in the infirmary to his classes, and brought him food atmealtimes. Professor Quirrell proctored his Battle Magic classes from achair, sitting.Watching Hermione die had hurt more than this, but that had endedmuch more quickly.This is the true Enemy.Harry had already thought that, after Hermione had died. Beingforced to watch Professor Quirrell die, day by day, week by week, had notdone much to change his mind.This is the true Enemy I have to face, Harry thought in Wednesday’s Defense class, watching Professor Quirrell leaning far to one side of his chairbefore that day’s seventh-year assistant caught him. Everything else is justshadows and distraction.Harry had been turning over Trelawney’s prophecy in his mind, wondering if maybe the true Dark Lord had nothing to do with Lord Voldemort at all. Born to those who have thrice defied him seemed to strongly invoke the Peverell brothers and the three Deathly Hallows—though Harrydidn’t exactly see how Death could have marked him as an equal, whichseemed to imply some sort of deliberate action on Death’s part.This alone is the true Enemy, Harry thought. After this will come ProfessorMcGonagall, Mum and Dad, even Neville in his time, unless the wound in theworld can be healed before then.There was nothing Harry could do. Madam Pomfrey was already doing for Professor Quirrell what magic could do, and magic seemed strictlysuperior to Muggle techniques when it came to healing.There was nothing Harry could do.Nothing he could do.Nothing.Nothing at all.Harry raised his hand, and knocked upon the door, in case the personthere could no longer detect him.“What is it?” came a strained voice from the infirmary room.“It’s me.”There was a long pause. “Come in,” said that voice.Harry slipped inside and closed the door behind him, and cast the Quieting Charm. He stood as far away from Professor Quirrell as he could,just in case his own magic was making the Professor feel uncomfortable.Though the sense of doom was fading, fading with each passing day.Professor Quirrell was lying back in his infirmary bed, only his headpropped up by a pillow. A coverlet of cottony material, red with blackstitching, covered him to his chest. A book hovered before his eyes, outlined in a pale glow which also surrounded a black cube lying by the bed.Not the Defense Professor’s own magic, then, but a device of some kind.The book was Thinking Physics by Epstein, the same book Harry hadlent to Draco a few months back. Harry had stopped fretting about itspossible misuse several weeks earlier.“This—” Professor Quirrell said, and coughed, it didn’t sound quiteright. “This is a fascinating book… if I’d ever realized…” A laugh, mixedwith another cough. “Why did I assume the Muggle arts… must not bemine? That they would be… of no use to me? Why did I never bother trying… to test it experimentally… as you would say? In case… my assumption… was wrong? It seems sheerly foolish of me… in retrospect…”Harry was having more trouble speaking than Professor Quirrell was.Wordlessly, Harry reached into his pocket, and laid a kerchief on the floor;which he unfolded to reveal a small white pebble, smooth and round.“What’s that?” said the Defense Professor.“It’s a, it’s a, Transfigured, unicorn.”Harry had checked the books, had learned that since he was too youngto have sexual thoughts he would be able to approach a unicorn without fear. The same books had said nothing about unicorns being smart.Harry had already noticed that every intelligent magical species was atleast partially humanoid, from merfolk to centaurs to giants, from elvesto goblins to veela. All had essentially humanlike emotions, many wereknown to interbreed with humans. Harry had already reasoned out thatmagic didn’t create new intelligence but just changed the shape of genetically human beings. Unicorns were equinoid, were not even partially humanoid, didn’t talk, used no tools, they were almost certainly just magicalhorses. If it was right to eat a cow to feed yourself for a day, then it had tobe right to drink a unicorn’s blood in order to stave off death for weeks.You couldn’t have it both ways.So Harry had gone into the Forbidden Forest wearing his Cloak. Hehad searched the Grove of Unicorns until he saw her, a proud creaturewith a pure white coat and violet hair, with three blue blotches on herflank. Harry had gone over, and the sapphire eyes had stared at him inquisitively. Harry had tapped out the sequence 1–2–3 on the ground several times with his shoes. The unicorn had shown no sign of respondingin kind. Harry had reached over, taken her hoof in his hand, and tappedthe same sequence with the unicorn’s hoof. The unicorn had only lookedat him curiously.And something about feeding the unicorn the sleeping-potion-lacedsugar cubes had still felt like murder.That magic gives their existence a weight of meaning which no mere animalcould possess… to slay something innocent to save oneself, that is a very grave sin.Those two phrases, from Professor McGonagall, from the centaur, hadboth run through Harry’s mind, over and over as the white unicorn hadyawned, laid down on the ground, and closed its eyes for what would bethe last time. The Transfiguration had lasted an hour, and Harry’s eyeshad watered repeatedly as he worked. The unicorn’s death might not havecome then, but it would come soon enough, and it was foreign to Harry’snature to try to refuse responsibility of any kind. Harry would just haveto hope that, if you didn’t kill the unicorn to save yourself, if you did it tohelp a friend, it would be acceptable in the end.Professor Quirrell’s eyebrows had climbed toward his hairline. Hisvoice was less soft, had something of his normal sharpness, as he said, “Iforbid you from doing that again.”“I wondered if you’d say that,” Harry said. He swallowed again. “Butthis unicorn is already, already doomed, so you might as well take it, Professor…”“Why have you done this?”If the Defense Professor really didn’t understand that, he was sloweron the uptake than anyone Harry had ever met. “I kept thinking therewas nothing I could do,” Harry said. “I got tired of thinking it.”Professor Quirrell closed his eyes. His head leaned back into the pillow. “You were lucky,” the Defense Professor said in a soft voice, “that aunicorn in Transfigured form… did not set off the Hogwarts wards, as astrange creature… I shall have to… take this outside the grounds, to makeuse of it… but that can be managed. I shall tell them that I wish to lookupon the lake… I will ask you to sustain the Transfiguration before yougo, and it should last long enough, after that… and with my last strength,dispel whatever death-alarms were placed to watch over the herd… which,the unicorn being not yet dead, but only Transfigured, will not yet havetriggered… you were very lucky, Mr. Potter.”Harry nodded. He started to speak, then stopped again. Wordsseemed to stick in his throat once more.You already calculated the expected utilities, if it works, if it goes wrong. Youassigned probabilities, you multiplied, and then you threw out the answer andwent with your new gut feeling, which was the same. So say it.“Do you know,” Harry said unsteadily, “of any way at all, by which yourlife might be saved?”The Defense Professor’s eyes opened. “Why… do you ask me that,boy?”“There’s… a spell I heard of, a ritual—”“Be silent,” said the Defense Professor.An instant later a snake lay in the bed.Even the snake’s eyes were dull.It did not rise.“Sspeak on,” hissed that snake, its flickering tongue its only motion.“There is… there iss a ritual, I heard of from the sschoolmasster, by which hethinkss the Dark Lord might have lived on. It iss called—”and Harry stopped, ashe realized that he did know how to say the word in Parseltongue. “Horcrux. It requiress a death, I have heard. But if you are dying in any casse, you mighttry to adapt the ritual, even at great rissk for the new sspell, sso that it can be donewith a different ssacriﬁce. It would change the whole world, if you ssucceed—thoughI don't know anything about the sspell—the sschoolmasster thought it tore off a pieceof ssoul, though I don't ssee how that could be true—”The snake was hissing laughter, strange sharp laughter, almost hysterical. “You tell me of that sspell? Me? You musst learn more caution in the future,boy. But it matterss not. I learned of the horcrux sspell ssince long ago. It iss meaninglesss.”“Meaningless?” Harry said aloud in surprise.“Would be pointlesss sspell from beginning, if ssoulss exissted. Tear piece of ssoul?That iss lie. Missdirection to hide true ssecret. Only one who doess not believe incommon liess will reasson further, ssee beneath obsscuration, realisse how to casstsspell. Required murder iss not ssacriﬁcial ritual at all. Ssudden death ssometimesmakess ghosst, if magic burssts and imprintss on nearby thing. Horcrux sspell channelss death-bursst through casster, createss your own ghosst insstead of victim'ss,imprintss ghosst in sspecial device. Ssecond victim pickss up horcrux device, deviceimprintss your memoriess into them. But only memoriess from time horcrux devicewass made. You ssee flaw?”The burning sensation was back in Harry’s throat. “No continuity of—”there wasn’t a snake word for consciousness “—sself, you would go on thinking after making the horcrux, then sself with new memoriess diess and iss not resstored—”“Yess, you do ssee. Alsso Merlin'ss Interdict preventss powerful sspells from passing through ssuch a device, ssince it iss not truly alive. Dark Wizardss who think toreturn thuss are weaker, eassily disspatched. None have perssissted long by ssuchmeanss. Perssonalitiess change, mix with victim'ss. Death iss not truly gainssaid.Real sself is losst, as you ssay. Not to my pressent tasste. Admit I conssidered it, longago.”A man was lying in the infirmary bed once more. The Defense Professor breathed, then made a wretched coughing sound.“Can you give me a full recipe for the spell?” Harry said, after a moment’s deliberation. “There might be some way to improve on the flaws,with enough research. Some way to do it ethically and have it work.” Likedoing the transfer into a clone body with a blank brain, instead of an innocent victim, which might also improve the fidelity of the personalitytransfer… though that still left the other problems.Professor Quirrell made a short sound, under his breath, that mighthave been laughter. “You know, boy,” Professor Quirrell whispered, “I hadthought… to teach you everything… the seeds of all the secrets I knew…from one living mind to another… so that later, when you found the rightbooks, you would be able to understand… I would have passed on myknowledge to you, my heir… we would have begun as soon as you askedme… but you never asked.”Even the grief surrounding by Harry like thick water gave way to that,to the sheer magnitude of the missed opportunity. “I was supposed to—?I didn’t know I was supposed to—!”Another coughing chuckle. “Ah yes… the unknowing Muggleborn… inheritage if not in blood… that is you. But I thought… better of it… that youshould not walk my path… it was not a good path, in the end.”“It’s not too late, Professor!” Harry said. A part of Harry yelled that hewas being selfish, and then another part shouted that down; there wouldbe other people to help.“Yes, it is too late… and you shall not… persuade me otherwise… Ihave… thought better of it… as I said… I am too full… of secrets better leftunknown… look at me.”Harry looked, almost despite himself.He saw a still-unwrinkled face, looking old and pained, beneath ahead rapidly losing its hair, even the sides looking wispy now; Harrysaw a face he’d always thought was sharp, now revealed as thin, muscleand fat fading away from the face, as from the arms beneath it, like theskeletal form of Bellatrix Black he’d seen in Azkaban—Harry’s head wrenched aside, unthinkingly.“You see,” whispered the Professor. “I dislike to sound cliched…Mr. Potter… but the truth is… the Arts called Dark… really are not goodfor a person… in the end.”Professor Quirrell breathed in, breathed out. There was quiet for atime in the infirmary, the two of them watched only by the elaboratelyornamented stone of the walls.“Is there anything left… unsaid between us?” said Professor Quirrell.“I am not dying today… mind you… not right now… but I do not know howlong… I shall be able to converse.”“There’s,” Harry said, swallowed again. “There’s a lot of things, waytoo many things, but… it might be the wrong thing to ask, but I don’twant—this one question unanswered—snake?”A snake lay on the bed.“I learned how the Killing Cursse workss. Requiress true hate to casst, not muchhate, but musst want target dead, they ssay. In prisson with life-eaterss, you casstKilling Cursse at guard—ssaid you did not want him dead—wass that lie? Here,now, at thiss disstance—you may sspeak truth—even if you fear it reflectss poorlyon you—it sshould not matter now, teacher. I wissh to know. Musst know. Will notabandon you, either way.”A man lay on the bed.“Listen carefully,” Professor Quirrell whispered. “I will tell you a conundrum… a riddle of a dangerous spell… when you know the answer tothat puzzle… you will also know… the answer to your question… are youlistening?”Harry nodded.“There is a limitation… to the Killing Curse. To cast it once… in afight… you must hate enough… to want the other dead. To cast Avada…Kedavra twice… you must hate enough… to kill twice… to cut their throatwith your own hands… to watch them die… then do it again. Very few…can hate enough… to kill someone… five times… they would… get bored.”The Defense Professor breathed several times, before continuing. “But ifyou look at history… you will find some Dark Wizards… who could cast theKilling Curse… over and over. A nineteenth-century witch… who calledherself Dark Evangel… the Aurors called her A. K. McDowell. She couldcast the Killing Curse… a dozen times… in one fight. Ask yourself… as Iasked myself… what is the secret… that she knew? What is deadlier thanhate… and flows without limit?”A second level to the Avada Kedavra spell, just like with the Patronus Charm…“I don’t really care,” Harry answered.The Defense Professor chuckled wetly. “Good. You are… learning. Soyou see…” A pause of transformation. “I did not wissh guard dead, after all.Casst Killing Cursse, but not with hate.” And then a man.Harry swallowed hard. It was both better, and worse, than whatHarry had suspected; and characteristic enough of Professor Quirrell. Acracked soul, for certain; but Professor Quirrell had never claimed to bewhole.“Any else… to say?” said the man in the bed.“Are you absolutely sure,” Harry said, “that there is nothing you’veever heard of that might save you, Professor? In all your lore? Finding anduniting all three Deathly Hallows, an ancient artifact that Merlin sealedbehind a riddle nobody’s ever figured out? You’ve seen some of what I cando. That I’m good at solving riddles. You know I can figure things out,sometimes, that other wizards can’t. I—” Harry’s voice broke. “I have astrong preference for your life, over your death, Professor Quirrell.”There was a long pause.“One thing,” whispered Professor Quirrell. “One thing… that mightdo it… or it might not… but to obtain it… is beyond your power, or mine…”Oh, it was just the setup for a subquest, said Harry’s Inner Critic.All the other parts screamed for that part to shut up. Life didn’t worklike that. Ancient artifacts could be found, but not in a month, not whenyou couldn’t leave Hogwarts and were still in your first year.Professor Quirrell took in a deep breath. Exhaled. “I’m sorry… thatcame out… too dramatic. Do not… get your hopes up… Mr. Potter. Youasked… for anything… no matter how unlikely. There is… a certain object… called…”A snake lay on the bed.“The Philossopher'ss Sstone,” hissed the snake.If there’d been a mass-manufacturable means of safe immortality thisentire time and nobody had bothered, Harry was going to snap and killeveryone.“I read of it in a book,”Harry hissed. “Concluded it wass obviouss myth. Noreason why ssame device would provide immortality and endlesss gold. Not unlesssssomeone wass jusst inventing happy sstoriess. Not to mention, every ssane perssonsshould have been ressearching wayss to make more Sstoness, or kidnapping makerto produce. Thought of you sspeciﬁcally, teacher.”A hissing of cold laughter. “Reassoning iss wisse, but not wisse enough. Likewith horcrux sspell, abssurdity hidess true ssecret. True Sstone iss not what that legend ssayss. True power iss not what sstoriess claim. Sstone's ssuppossed maker wassnot one who made it. One who holdss it now, wass not born to name now ussed. YetSstone iss powerful healing device in truth. Have you heard it sspoken of ?”“Jusst in the book.”1651 *“One who holdss Sstone iss repossitory of much lore. Taught sschoolmasster manyssecretss. Sschoolmasster hass ssaid nothing of Sstone'ss holder, nothing of Sstone? Nohintss?”“Not that I can eassily recall,” Harry replied honestly.“Ah,”hissed the snake. “Ah, well.”“Could assk sschoolmasster—”“No! Do not assk him, boy. He would not take quesstion well.”“But if the Sstone only healss—”“Sschoolmasster doess not believe that, would not believe that. Too many havessought Sstone, or ssought holder's lore. Do not assk. Musst not assk. Do not try toobtain Sstone yoursself. I forbid.”A man lay on the bed once more. “I am at… my limit…” said ProfessorQuirrell. “I must regain… my strength… before I go… to the forest… withyour gift. Leave now… but sustain the Transfiguration… before you go.”Harry reached out, touched the white pebble lying within the kerchief,renewing the Transfiguration on it. “It should last for one hour and fiftythree minutes after this,” Harry said.“Your studies… do well.”It was far longer than Harry’s Transfigurations had lasted at the startof the school year. Second-year spells came to him easily now, withoutstrain; which wasn’t surprising, since he would be twelve in less than twomonths. Harry could even have cast a Memory Charm, if it had beengood for someone to forget every memory involving their left arm. Hewas climbing the power ladder, slowly, from very far down.The thought came with a potential for sadness, a thought of one dooropening as another closed; which Harry also rejected.The door to the infirmary closed behind Harry, as the Boy-Who-Livedwalked swiftly and with purpose, shrugging on his Invisibility Cloak ashe moved. Soon, presumably, Professor Quirrell would call for assistance;and an older student trio would guide the Defense Professor into somequiet place, maybe the forest, with an excuse of viewing the lake or somesuch. Someplace the Defense Professor could eat a unicorn undetected,after Harry’s Transfiguration wore off.And then Professor Quirrell would be healthier, for a time. His powerwould return to him as strong as he’d ever been, for a much shorter time.It wouldn’t last.Harry’s fists clenched as he strode, the tension radiating up his armmuscles. If the Defense Professor’s treatment regimen hadn’t been interrupted, by Harry and the Aurors that he had brought to Hogwarts…It was stupid to blame himself, Harry knew it was stupid and somehow his brain was doing it anyway. Like his brain was searching, carefullyfinding and selecting some way for this to be his fault, no matter how farit had to stretch.As if having things be his fault were the only way that his brain knewhow to grieve.A trio of seventh-year Slytherins passed Harry’s invisible form in thehallway, heading for the healer’s offices where the Professor waited, looking deeply serious and concerned. Was that how other people grieved?Or did they, on some level, not really care, as Professor Quirrellthought?There is a second level to the Killing Curse.Harry’s brain had solved the riddle instantly, in the moment of firsthearing it; as though the knowledge had always been inside him, waitingto make itself known.Harry had read once, somewhere, that the opposite of happinesswasn’t sadness, but boredom; and the author had gone on to say that tofind happiness in life you asked yourself not what would make you happy,but what would excite you. And by the same reasoning, hatred wasn’tthe true opposite of love. Even hatred was a kind of respect that youcould give to someone’s existence. If you cared about someone enoughto prefer their dying to their living, it meant you were thinking aboutthem.It had come up much earlier, before the Trial, in conversation withHermione; when she’d said something about magical Britain beingPrejudiced, with considerable and recent justification. And Harry hadthought—but not said—that at least she’d been let into Hogwarts to bespat upon.Not like certain people living in certain countries, who were, it wassaid, as human as anyone else; who were said to be sapient beings, worthmore than any mere unicorn. But who nonetheless wouldn’t be allowedto live in Muggle Britain. On that score, at least, no Muggle had the rightto look a wizard in the eye. Magical Britain might discriminate againstMuggleborns, but at least it allowed them inside so they could be spatupon in person.What is deadlier than hate, and flows without limit?“Indifference,” Harry whispered aloud, the secret of a spell he wouldnever be able to cast; and kept striding toward the library to read anythinghe could find, anything at all, about the Philosopher’s Stone.June 4th, 1992.aphne Greengrass was in the Slytherin common room, writing a let-ter to her Lady Mother (who was surprisingly intransigent aboutpower-sharing, despite not even being in Hogwarts to exercise control)when she saw Draco Malfoy stagger in through the portrait door carrying what must have been a dozen books, Vincent and Gregory behind himeach carrying a dozen more. The Auror who’d accompanied Malfoy stuckhis head in briefly, then withdrew to who-knew-where.Draco looked around, then seemed to be struck by a bright idea as hestaggered toward her, Vincent and Gregory following after.“Can you help me read these?” said Draco, sounding slightly out ofbreath as he approached.“What.” Lessons were over, only the exams were left now, and sincewhen did Malfoys ask Greengrasses for help with their homework?“These,” Draco Malfoy said importantly, “are all the library booksMiss Granger borrowed between April 1st and April 16th. I thought I’dgo through them in case there are any Clues there, only then I thought,maybe you should help because you knew Miss Granger better.”Daphne stared at the books. “The General read all that in two weeks?”A twinge of pain went through her heart, but she suppressed it.“Well, I don’t know if Miss Granger finished them all,” Draco said. Heheld up a cautioning finger. “In fact, we don’t know if she read any ofthem, or if she really borrowed them, I mean, all we’ve observed is that thelibrary ledger says she checked them out—”Daphne suppressed a groan. Malfoy had been talking like this forweeks. There were some people who clearly were not meant to be involved with mysterious murders because it did strange things to their minds.“Mr. Malfoy, I couldn’t read all these if I spent my whole summer doingnothing else.”“Then just skim through them, please?” Draco said. “Especially ifthere’s, you know, mysterious words scribbled in her handwriting, or abookmark left inside, or—”“I’ve seen those plays too, Mr. Malfoy.” Daphne rolled her eyes. “Don’twe have Aurors now for—”“We’re doomed!” shrieked Millicent Bulstrode, as she burst up from thelower chambers into the Slytherin common room.People paused to look at her.“It’s Professor Quirrell!”A sudden air of attentiveness, as of long-standing disputes about tobe settled. “Well, finally,” someone said, as Millicent tried to catch herbreath. “He’s only got, what, ten days left to go bad?”“Eleven days,” said the seventh-year who was running the bettingpool.“He’s gotten a little better suddenly and he’s going to summon the first-yearsfor our Defense final! By surprise! In fifty minutes!”“A Defense final?” Pansy said blankly. “But Professor Quirrell doesn’tgive exams.”“The Ministry Defense final!” shrieked Millicent.“But Professor Quirrell doesn’t teach anything from the Ministry curriculum,” objected Pansy.Daphne was already fleeing to her room, racing for the first-year Defense textbook that she hadn’t touched since September and screamingcurses inside her mind.One desk back of her, someone was crying, their soft sobs providing abackground chant of despair for the classroom. Daphne looked back, expecting to see a Hufflepuff and hoping it wasn’t Hannah, and was surprised at first (though not on further reflection) to see it was a Ravenclaw.Before them were set the exam parchments, turned over, waiting forthe bell.Fifty minutes hadn’t been nearly enough preparation time, but itwas something, and Daphne was now feeling ashamed that she hadn’tthought to send messengers to warn the Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, andGryffindor Houses. They’d started giving House Points again just threedays ago, at the beginning of June, but the Auxiliary Protective SpecialCommittee still ought to promote House unity.Another Ravenclaw, sitting four desks to her left, also started to cry.That was Katherine Tung of Dragon Army, if she recalled correctly, whomshe’d once seen take on three Sunshine Soldiers simultaneously withouta flinch.Daphne had calmed down after the first couple of minutes of franticreading. It was just a test, not a murder or anything; and if almost all thefirst-year students turned in mostly blank parchments then it stood toreason that nobody would be shamed. But Daphne could understand, ifnot exactly sympathize, that Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs might not seeit that way.“He’s evil,” another Ravenclaw witch said in a shaking voice. “Onehundred percent pure Dark Wizard to the bone. The Dark Lord Grindelwald wouldn’t do this, not to children, he’s worse than You-Know-Who.”Daphne looked reflexively at where Professor Quirrell was sitting,slumped to one side but his eyes alert; and she thought she saw theDefense Professor smile for one tiny instant. No, that had to be herimagination, there was no way the Defense Professor could have heardthat.The bell rang.Daphne flipped the parchment over.The top was stamped with the seals for the Ministry, the HogwartsBoard of Governors, and the Department of Magical Education, andrunes to detect cheating. Below that was a line for her to write her name,and a list of exam rules with a picture of Lindsay Gagnon, the Director ofthe Department of Magical Education, shaking an admonishing fingerat everyone.Halfway down the page was the first exam question.It was, Why is it important for children to stay away from strange creatures?There was a stunned pause.One student began laughing, she thought it was from the Gryffindorsection of the class. Professor Quirrell made no motion to censor it, andthe laughter spread.Nobody spoke aloud, but the students looked around at each other,exchanging glances as the laughter died down, and then as if by some unspoken agreement they all looked at Professor Quirrell, who was smilingdown at them benevolently.Daphne bent over her exam, wearing a defiant evil smile that wouldhave done proud to either Godric Gryffindor or Grindelwald; and shewrote down, Because my Stunning Hex, my Most Ancient Blade, and my Patronus Charm won’t work against everything.Harry Potter turned over the last page of his Defense exam.Even Harry had needed to quash a small bit of nervousness, some tinyremnant of his childhood, upon reading the first real question (‘How canyou make a Shrieking Eel be silent?’). Professor Quirrell’s lessons hadspent roughly zero time on the surprising yet useless trivia that some idiot had imagined a ‘Defense class’ should look like. In principle, Harrycould have used his Time-Turner to read through the first-year Defensebook after being notified of the surprise exam; but that might have unfairly skewed the grading curve for others. After staring at the questionfor a couple of seconds, Harry had written down ‘Quieting Charm’, andincluded the casting directions in case the Ministry grader didn’t believethat Harry knew it.Once Harry had decided to just answer all the questions correctly, theexam had gone by very quickly. The most realistic answer to more thanhalf the questions was ‘Stunning Hex’, and many of the other questionshad optimal solutions along the lines of ‘Turn around and walk in the opposite direction’ or ‘Throw away the cheese and buy a new pair of shoes.’The last question on the test was “What would you do if you suspectedthere might be a Bogeysnake underneath your bed?” The Ministryapproved answer, Harry could in fact recall from his read-through ofthe textbook at the start of the year, was Tell your parents. The problemwith this had occurred to Harry right away, which was why Harry hadremembered it.After some pondering, Harry wrote down:Dear Ministry grader: I’m afraid the real answer to that is a secret, but restassured that a Bogeysnake would present no more trouble to me than a mountaintroll, a Dementor, or You-Know-Who. Please inform your superiors that I findyour standard answer prejudicial to Muggleborns, and that I expect this failingwill be corrected at once without any need for my direct intervention.Sincerely, the Boy-Who-Lived.Harry signed the last parchment with a broad flourish, turned it overinto his stack, put down his quill, and sat up.Looking around, Harry saw that Professor Quirrell seemed to be looking in his rough direction, though the Defense Professor’s head had nodded to one side. The other students were still writing. Some of them weresilently crying, but they were still writing. Continuing to fight was also alesson Professor Quirrell had taught.Interminably later, the official exam time was up. A seventh-year student went from desk to desk, collecting the exams in Professor Quirrell’splace.The last exam parchment was collected, and Professor Quirrell sat upstraight.“My young students,” he said softly. The seventh-year student hadher wand trained on the Defense Professor’s mouth, so that they all heardhis voice seeming to come from right beside them. “I know… that probably seemed very fearsome to some of you… it is a different kind of fearfrom facing the enemy’s wand… you must conquer it separately. So I…shall tell you this now. It is the custom of Hogwarts… that grades aregiven in the second week of June. But for my case… they can make an ex* 1659 *ception, I think.” The Defense Professor smiled his familiar dry smile,tinged now as though by a suppressed grimace. “I know you are worried… that you were not prepared for this exam… that my lessons havenot covered this material… and I quite forgot to mention… that it was approaching… though you should have known… it would come in time. ButI have just now magically checked… the answers you have given on that…terribly, terribly important final exam… though of course only the Ministry grade is official… and assigned your full-year grades taking the results into account… and magically written your full grades down on theseparchments,” Professor Quirrell tapped a stack of parchments on the sideof his desk, “which will now be handed out… an incredible spell… is it not?”A few students on the Ravenclaw side were looking indignant, but forthe most part the students just looked relieved, and some Slytherins werechuckling. Harry would have laughed too, if not for the pain of watchingProfessor Quirrell gasp out the words.The seventh-year student standing beside Professor Quirrell pointedher wand and spoke an incantation in magical pseudo-Latin. The parchments rose up and started to drift through the air, separating in mid-flowto drift toward each student.Harry waited until his parchment had arrived on his desk, and thenunfolded it.The parchment said EE+, which stood for Exceeds Expectations. Itwas the second-highest grade letter, the highest being Outstanding.In another world, a distant vanished world, a little boy named Harrywould have shouted with indignation about receiving only the secondhighest grade. This Harry sat quietly and thought. Professor Quirrellwas making some point, and it wasn’t as though the exact grade lettermattered in any other way. Was Professor Quirrell saying that Harry haddone relatively well, but not lived up to his full potential? Or was the grademeant to be read literally, that Harry had in fact exceeded the DefenseProfessor’s expectations?“All of you… pass,” Professor Quirrell said, as the students all looked attheir final grades, as sighs of relief rose from desks and Lavender Brownraised her parchment in a clenched fist held high with triumph. “Everystudent in first-year Battle Magic has passed… except for one.”A number of students looked up in sudden terror.Harry sat there silently. He had seen the point immediately, and evenif it was a wrong point, he knew Professor Quirrell would never, ever betalked out of making it.“All of you in this room… have received grades of at least Acceptable.Neville Longbottom… who took this test in the Longbottom home… received a grade of Outstanding. But the other student who is not here…has had a Dreadful grade entered on her record… for failing the only important test… that was given her this year. I would have marked her evenlower… but that would have been in poor taste.”The room was very quiet, though a number of students were staringangrily at the Professor.“You may think that a grade of Dreadful… is not fair. That Miss Granger was faced with a test… for which her lessons… had not prepared her.That she was not told… that the exam was coming on that day.”The Defense Professor drew in a shaking breath.“Such is realism,” said Professor Quirrell. “The only important test…may come at any time… be better prepared for it… than she was. As forthe rest of you… those who have received Exceeds Expectations or above…have received my letters of recommendation… to certain organizationsbeyond Britain’s shores… where your training might be completed. Theywill contact you… when you are old enough… if you still appear worthy…and if you have not failed an important test. And remember… from thisday… you must train yourselves… you cannot rely… on future Defense professors. Your first year of Battle Magic is over… you are dismissed.”Professor Quirrell sat back with his eyes closed, seeming to ignore theexcited babble that broke out around him.In time most of the students had departed, and one remained, stayinga prescribed distance from the Defense Professor.The Defense Professor opened his eyes.Harry raised the parchment with its EE+, still silent.The Defense Professor smiled, and it went all the way to those tiredeyes.“It is the same grade… that I received in my own first year.”1661 *“Th, th, th,” Harry couldn’t make the words thank you come out, theywere stuck in his suddenly closed throat, the Defense Professor tilting hishead and giving him an inquiring stare, so Harry just bowed jerkily andthen left the room.Nine days yet remained.June 13th, 1992.was the last week of school in Hogwarts, and Professor Quirrell wasIt stillalive, barely. The Defense Professor himself would be in a healer’sbed, this day, as he’d been for almost the last week.Hogwarts tradition said that exams were given in the first week ofJune, that exam results were released the second week, and that in thethird week, there would be the Leave-Taking Feast on Sunday and theHogwarts Express transporting you to London on Monday.Harry had wondered, a long time ago when he’d first read about thatschedule, just what exactly the students did during the rest of the secondweek of June, since ‘waiting for exam results’ didn’t sound like much; andthe answer had surprised him when he’d found out.But now the second week of June was done as well, and it was Saturday; there was nothing left of the year but the Leave-Taking Feast on the14th and the Hogwarts Express ride on the 15th.And nothing had been answered.Nothing had been resolved.Hermione’s killer hadn’t been found.Somehow Harry had been thinking that, surely, all the truth wouldcome out by the end of the school year; like that was the end of a mysterynovel and the mystery’s answer had been promised him. Certainly it hadto be known by the time the Defense Professor… died, it couldn’t be allowed for Professor Quirrell to die without knowing the answer, withouteverything being neatly resolved. Not exam grades, certainly not death,it was only truth that finished a story…But unless you bought Draco Malfoy’s latest theory that ProfessorSprout had been assigning and grading less homework around the timeof Hermione being framed for attempted murder, thereby proving thatProfessor Sprout had been spending her time setting it up, the truthremained unfound.And instead, like the world had priorities that were more like otherpeople’s way of thinking, the year was going to end with a climactic Quidditch match.In the air above the stadium, distant figures on broomsticks swoopedand pirouetted and spun around each other. The red-purplish truncatedtetrahedron that was the Quaffle was caught, tossed, blocked, and occasionally thrown through floating hoops, accompanied by stadiumrocking cries of triumph or dismay. Blue and green and yellow and redtrimmed robes shouted with the enthusiasm that people felt so easilywhen no action would be required from them personally.It was the first Quidditch match Harry had attended at Hogwarts, andhe’d already decided that it would be the last.“Davies has the Quaffle!” shouted the amplified voice of Lee Jordan. “That’s another ten points for Ravenclaw in seven… six… five… holysmokes, he’s done it already! Smack through the center of the centralhoop! I’ve never seen such a winning streak—I’m calling it right now forDavies becoming Captain next year after Bortan steps down—”Lee’s voice cut out abruptly and Professor McGonagall’s own amplified voice said, “That’s the Ravenclaw team’s own business, Mr. Jordan.Confine yourself to the match, please.”“And the Slytherins take possession—Flint hands off the Quaffle tothe lovely—”“Mr. Jordan!”“To the merely acceptable Sharon Vizcaino, whose hair trails behindher like a comet as she blazes toward the Ravenclaw defense—now withtwo Bludgers in close pursuit! Pucey’s on Sharon’s tail—what are youdoing, Inglebee?—and she swerves in midair to avoid—IS THAT THE“Calm down, Mr. Jordan!”MISSED PLAY I’VE EVER SEEN! And the Snitch is gone—maybe gonefor good, after being missed that badly—Pucey’s heading off towards thegoal posts, Inglebee’s nowhere near him—”In a distant era of history, maybe in another world entirely, ProfessorQuirrell had undertaken that the House Cup would be awarded to eitherSlytherin or Ravenclaw. Or possibly, somehow, both; for he had promisedthat three wishes would be granted. So far it was looking good on two outof three.If you just went by the current score, Hufflepuff was leading therace for the House Cup by something like five hundred points, thanks toHufflepuff’s students doing their homework and staying out of trouble. Itappeared that Professor Snape had been strategically taking quite a lotof points from Hufflepuffs for, er, the last seven years or so. SlytherinHouse, reigning champion for the last seven years, still had to its advantage a certain generosity of its Head of House in handing out points; andthis was sufficient to put it neck-and-neck with Ravenclaw House, homeof the academic achievers. Gryffindor was far behind in the last place,as befit the House of nonconformists; Gryffindor had Slytherin’s profilewhen it came to academics and mischief, only without the advantage ofProfessor Snape. Even Fred and George had barely broken even on theyear.Ravenclaw House and Slytherin House both needed a lot of pointsfrom somewhere if either wanted to catch up with Hufflepuff in the nexttwo days.And so far as anyone knew, Professor Quirrell hadn’t done a singlething leading to the obvious result. It was happening all by itself, now thatone lone Professor in Hogwarts had taught a class with creative problem* 1665 *solving.The final Quidditch match of the year was between Ravenclaw andSlytherin. Earlier in the year, Gryffindor’s initial Quidditch lead had vanished after their new Seeker, Emmett Shear, fell off a possibly malfunctioning broomstick during his second game. This had also required somehasty rescheduling of the remaining games.This, the final game of the year, wouldn’t end until the Snitch wascaught.Quidditch scores added directly onto the House points total.And what did you know, today it seemed that both the Slytherin andRavenclaw Seekers just could… not… catch… the… Snitch.“Language, Mr. Jordan, or I’ll remove you from this game! Though itwas a terrible play, I admit.”Harry had to admit that Lee Jordan and Professor McGonagall hada wonderful comedic routine, with Jordan as the banana-man and Professor McGonagall as the straight-woman; Harry now felt a little sorry tohave missed it at the earlier Quidditch matches. It was a side of ProfessorMcGonagall he hadn’t seen before.A few seats down from where Harry sat in the Hufflepuff section ofthe Quidditch bleachers, there lurked the hulking form of Cedric Diggory.The Super Hufflepuff had observed the most recent near-air-collision between Cho Chang and Terence Higgs with the keen eye of a wizard whowas a Seeker and a Quidditch Captain in his own right.“The Ravenclaw Seeker is new,” Cedric said. “But Higgs is in his seventh year. I’ve played against him. He’s better than that.”“You think it’s a strategy?” asked one of the Hufflepuffs sitting nextto Cedric.“It would make sense if Slytherin needed some extra points to leadfor the Quidditch Cup,” Cedric said. “But Slytherin already has us beatfor the title. What are they thinking? They could’ve won right there!”The game had started at six o’ clock in the afternoon. A typical gamewould have gone until seven or so, at which point it would have been timefor dinner. June in Scotland meant plenty of daylight; sunset wasn’t untilten.It was at eight pm and six minutes, according to Harry’s watch, whenSlytherin had just scored another 10 points bringing the score to 170–140,when Cedric Diggory leapt out of his seat and shouted “Those bastards!”“Yeah!” cried a young boy beside him, leaping to his own feet. “Whodo they think they are, scoring points?”“Not that!” cried Cedric Diggory. “They’re—they’re trying to steal theCup from us!”“But we’re not in the running any more for—”“Not the Quidditch Cup! The House Cup!”The word spread, with cries of outrage.That was Harry’s cue.Harry politely asked a Hufflepuff witch sitting next to him, andanother Hufflepuff sitting one row above him, if they could move aside.Then Harry drew forth from his pouch a huge scroll, and unfurled it intoa 2-meter-tall banner which stuck in place in midair. The enchantmenthad been done courtesy of a sixth-year Ravenclaw who had a reputationfor knowing less about Quidditch than Harry did.In huge, glowing purple letters, the sign read:2 : 06 : 47Beneath it was a Snitch, with a blinking red X over it.Second, after second, after second, the time counter incremented.As that counter rose higher, there seemed to be an awful lot of Hufflepuffs who’d decided that they wanted to sit next to Harry’s banner.As the game dragged on past nine, there also seemed to be a lot ofGryffindors.As the sun set and Harry started using Lumos to read his books—he’dgiven up on the actual game a long time ago—there were a noticeablenumber of Ravenclaws who’d betrayed patriotism for sanity.And Professor Sinistra.And Professor Vector.And as the stars began to come out, Professor Flitwick.The climactic final Quidditch game of the year… dragged on.One of the things Harry hadn’t planned on, when he’d decided to dothis, was that he would still be out here at—Harry glanced at his watch—eleven-oh-four at night. Harry was now reading a sixth-year Transfiguration textbook; or rather he’d weighted the book open, illuminated bya Muggle glowstick, while he did one of the exercises. Last week, whenthe graduating Ravenclaws were discussing their N.E.W.T. scores, Harryhad overheard that upper-year Transfiguration practice involved several‘shaping exercises’ that relied more on control and precise thinking thanraw power; and Harry had promptly set out to learn those, whackinghimself hard on the forehead for not trying to read all the later-yeartextbooks earlier. Professor McGonagall had approved Harry doing ashaping exercise that involved controlling the way in which a Transfiguring object approached its final form—for example, Transfiguring aquill so that the shaft grew out first, then the barbs. Harry was doingan analogous exercise with pencils, growing out the lead first, thensurrounding it with wood and finally having the eraser form on top. AsHarry had suspected, focusing his attention and magic into a particularpart of the pencil’s ongoing transformation had proven similar to themental discipline used in partial Transfiguration—which could indeedhave been used to fake the same effect, by partially Transfiguring onlythe outer layers of the object. This way was proving relatively easier,though.Harry finished his current pencil and looked up at the Quidditchgame, which was, check, still fantastically boring. Lee Jordan wascommentating in a tone of dull disgust, “Another ten points—yay—whoopee—and now someone takes possession of the Quaffle again—askif I care who.”Almost nobody remaining in the stands was paying attention either,since everyone who’d remained in the stadium seemed to have discovered a new and more interesting sport, the debate about how to amendthe House Cup rules and/or Quidditch. The argument had becomeheated to the point where all of the nearby Professors were barely keeping order at a level short of open combat. This argument, unfortunately,had considerably more than two factions. Some darned busybodies wereproposing sensible-sounding alternatives to eliminating the Snitch entirely, and this was threatening to split the vote and sap the momentumfor reform.In retrospect, Harry thought, it would have been nice to have Dracounfurl his own banner from the Slytherin side saying ‘SNITCHES AREAWESOME’, to set the polarity of the debate. Harry had squinted over atthe Slytherin section earlier, but he hadn’t been able to spot Draco anywhere in the stands. Severus Snape, who could also have been sympathetic enough to play the villainous opposition, was likewise nowhere tobe seen.“Mr. Potter?” said a voice next to him.Beside Harry’s seat was standing a short but older Hufflepuff boy,someone who’d never before come to Harry’s attention, holding out ablank parchment envelope with wax dripped on the front. The wax wasalso blank, without impression.“What is it?” said Harry.“It’s me,” said the boy. “With the envelope you gave me. I know yousaid not to talk to you, but—”“Then don’t talk to me,” Harry said.The boy tossed the envelope at Harry and walked away, looking offended. It made Harry wince a little, but it probably hadn’t been the wrongdecision considering the temporal issues…Then Harry broke the unsigned wax seal and drew out the envelope’scontents. It was parchment instead of the Muggle paper that Harrywould have expected, but the writing on it was his own handwriting, ifdone with a quill instead of a pen. The parchment said:Beware the constellation,and help the watcher of stars.Pass unseen by the life-eaters’ confederates,and by the wise and the well-meaning.Six, and seven in a square,in the place that is prohibited and bloody stupid.Harry took it in at a glance, then folded the paper again and put itback into his cloak with another exhaled sigh. ‘Beware the constellation’,really? Harry would have expected a riddle left by himself, to himself, tohave been easier to interpret… though some parts were obvious enough.Clearly future-Harry had been worried about this paper being intercepted, and while present-Harry wouldn’t ordinarily have thought ofthe local Aurors as ‘the ones in league with the Dementors of Azkaban’,maybe that had been the best way to say ‘Auror’ without potentially tipping off anyone else who read the parchment and did their own best todecrypt it. Translating the idiom back out of the Parseltongue he’d usedduring the Incident with Azkaban… that worked, Harry supposed.The note had said that Professor Quirrell needed help, and that whatever was going on needed to pass unnoticed from the Aurors, and fromDumbledore and McGonagall and Flitwick. Since Time-Turning was involved already, the obvious solution was to leave for the loo, travel backin time, and return to the game right after he’d left.Harry started to rise from his seat, then hesitated. His Hufflepuffside was remarking something about leaving the Auror escorts behindand not telling Professor McGonagall anything, and wondering if his future self was being stupid.Harry unfolded the parchment again, and took another glance at thecontents.On closer examination, the riddle-verse didn’t say that Harry couldn’tbring anyone along. Draco Malfoy… was he missing from the Quidditchgame because future-Harry, hours in the past, had brought Draco withhim as backup? But that didn’t make sense, there wasn’t much marginalimprovement in safety from bringing along another first-year……Draco Malfoy would certainly have been present, regardless of hispersonal feelings about Quidditch, to watch Slytherin clinch the HouseCup. Had something happened to him?Suddenly Harry didn’t feel as tired anymore.A trickle of adrenaline was starting to rise in Harry, but no, thiswouldn’t be like the troll. The message had told Harry when to arrive.Harry wouldn’t be too late, not this time.Harry glanced over at where Cedric Diggory was looking back andforth, visibly torn between a clutch of Ravenclaws arguing that the Snitchhad to be kept because it was traditional and rules were rules, and a packof Hufflepuffs saying that it wasn’t fair for the Seeker to be more important than the other players.Cedric Diggory had been an excellent dueling tutor to Harry andNeville, and Harry had thought they’d established a good relationship.More importantly, a student taking literally all of the electives wouldhave his own Time-Turner. Maybe Harry could try to get Cedric to goback in time with him? The Super Hufflepuff seemed like a good sparewand to have by your side in any sort of sticky situation…1671 *Later, and earlier:Harry’s watch now said 11:45, which translated into 6:45pm after looping back five hours.“It’s time,” Harry murmured to the empty air, and began walkingdown the third-floor corridor above the grand staircase, on the righthand side.‘The place that is prohibited’ would ordinarily mean the ForbiddenForest; that was probably what someone intercepting the message wasmeant to think. But the Forbidden Forest was huge, and there was morethan one distinguished location inside it. No obvious Schelling Point atwhich to rendezvous, or find some event that needed intervention.But when you added the ‘bloody stupid’ modifier, there was only oneprohibited place in Hogwarts that fit.And so Harry set forth on that outlawed path where, if rumor spoketrue, all the first-year Gryffindors had gone before. The third-floor corridor, on the right-hand side. A mysterious door leading to a series ofrooms filled with dangerous and potentially lethal traps that nobodycould possibly get through, especially if they were only in their first year.Harry didn’t know himself what sort of traps awaited. Which, on reflection, meant that the students who’d gone through had been surprisingly scrupulous about not ruining the puzzle for others. Maybe therewas a sign down there saying Don’t give it away, just as a favor to me, sincerelyHeadmaster Dumbledore. All Harry knew so far was that the outer doorwould open to Alohomora, and that the final room contained a magic mirror that would show your reflection in some situation you found highlyappealing, which was apparently the big payoff.The third-floor corridor was illuminated by dim blue light thatseemed to come from nowhere, and the arches were covered with cobwebs, as though the corridor hadn’t been used in centuries rather thanjust the last year.Harry’s pouch was loaded with useful Muggle things, and useful wizarding things, and everything he’d found that could possibly be a questitem. (Harry had asked Professor McGonagall to recommend someonewho could expand the pouch’s capacity, and she’d just done it herself.)Harry had applied the Charm he’d learned for battles that made his eyeglasses stick to his face, regardless of how his head moved. Harry hadrefreshed the Transfigurations he was maintaining, both the tiny jewelin the ring on his hand and the other one, in case he was knocked unconscious. He wasn’t literally ready for anything, but Harry was as ready ashe thought he could be.The five-sided floor tiles creaked beneath Harry’s shoes and vanishedbehind him like the future becoming the past. It was almost 6:49—six, andseven in a square. Obvious if you thought in Muggle math, otherwise notso much.Just as Harry was about to round another corner, something tickledat the back of his mind, and he heard a soft voice talking.“…sensible person… wait until later… after certain faculty had departed…”Harry stopped, then crept forward as lightly as he could, not goingaround the corner, trying to hear Professor Quirrell’s voice better.There came a louder cough, and then the soft voice spoke again fromaround the corner. “But if they were also… to depart themselves… at thattime…” murmured the voice, “they might think… this final game… makesfor the best distraction… left in this year… a predictable distraction. So Ilooked… to see what people of significance… were not at the game… and Isaw the Headmaster missing… but for all my magic can tell me… he couldbe in another… realm of existence… I also saw your own absence… so Idecided to go… where you were. That is what I am doing here… now…what are you doing here?”Harry breathed shallowly, and listened.“And just how did you know where I was?” drawled the voice ofSeverus Snape, so much louder that Harry nearly jumped.A small, coughing laugh. “Check your wand… for Trace.”Severus said something in magical pseudo-Latin, and then, “Youdared tamper with my wand? You dared?”“You are a suspect… just like myself… so your false indignation iswasted… however finely crafted it may be… now tell me… what are youdoing?”“I am watching this door,” said the voice of Professor Snape. “And Iwill ask you to be off from it!”“On whose authority… are you ordering me… my fellow Professor?”There was a pause, then, “Why, the Headmaster’s,” came the smoothvoice of Severus Snape. “I was ordered by him to watch this door duringthe Quidditch match, and as a Professor I must obey his whims. I shallhave words about it with the Board of Governors later, but for now I amdoing as I must. Now be off with you, as the Headmaster desires.”“What? You mean I am to believe… that you abandoned yourSlytherins… during their most important… game of the year… and leaptup like a dog… at Dumbledore’s word? Well that… I must say… is entirelyplausible. Even so… I think it would be wise… if I kept my own watchover you.. while you watch this fine door.” There was a sound of rustlingcloth and a soft thud, as if someone had sat down hard upon the ground,or maybe just fallen.“Oh, for the love of Merlin—” Severus Snape’s voice now sounded angry. “Get up, you!”“Ba-blu-a-bu-bluh—” said the Defense Professor’s zombie-mode.“Get up!” said Severus Snape, and there was a soft thud.Help the watcher of stars—Harry stepped around the corner, though it was possible that he’dhave done so even without an intertemporal message. Had ProfessorSnape just kicked Professor Quirrell? That would have been foolhardy ifProfessor Quirrell had been dead and buried.A round-topped door of dark wood was framed within a stone arch,set within the dusty marble bricks of Hogwarts. Where a Muggle wouldhave set a doorknob there was only a handle of polished metal; there wereno visible locks, or visible keyholes. Set upon the wall to either side, a pairof torches burned, sending forth an ominous orange glow. Before thedoor stood the Potions Master in his customary stained robes. Besidethe door, to the left side beneath the orange torch, slumped the form ofthe Defense Professor, back against the wall, head staring out at the surroundings. The eyes seemed to flicker, as if halfway between awareness,and emptiness.“What,” said the towering form of the Potions Master, “are you doinghere, Potter?”Going by facial expressions and tone of voice, the Potions Master wasquite angry with Harry; and certainly was not Harry’s co-conspirator incouncils to which the Defense Professor had never been invited.“I’m not sure,” Harry said. He wasn’t sure what role he should be playing, and was, in desperation, falling back on simple honesty. “I think perhaps I’m supposed to be keeping an eye on the Defense Professor.”The Potions Master stared at him coldly. “Where’s your escort, Potter?Students are not to wander these halls alone!”Harry’s mind was genuinely blank. The game was afoot, and nobodyhad told him the rules. “I’m not sure how to answer that…”The cold expression on Professor Snape’s face flickered. “Perhaps Ishould call the Aurors,” he said.“Wait!” Harry blurted.The Potions Master’s hand hovered about his robes. “Why?” said thePotions Master.“I… I just think you probably shouldn’t call them…”In a blur, the Potions Master’s wand was in his hand. “Nullus confundio!” A black jet darted out and hit Harry, striking in the direction Harryhad already started to evade. There followed four other spells, containingwords like Polyfluis and Metamorphus; and for those Harry politely stoodstill.After all of those spells had failed to produce any effect, Severus Snapewas staring at Harry with a dark glitter that now seemed genuine. “I suggest,” the Potions Master said softly, “that you explain yourself, Potter.”“I can’t explain myself,” Harry said. “I don’t have the Time, not yet.”Harry looked directly into the Potions Master’s gaze as he said thewords myself and time, widening his own eyes to try to convey the keyinformation, and the Potions Master hesitated.Harry was frantically trying to work out who was pretending to bewhat. Since Professor Quirrell wasn’t in on Dumbledore’s conspiracy,Severus was pretending to be the evil Potions Master of Hogwarts, who’dbeen sent here by the Headmaster… and might or might not have actuallybeen sent here by Dumbledore… but Professor Quirrell either thought, orwas pretending to think, that someone needed to keep an eye on Professor Snape… and Harry himself had been sent here by future-Harry andhad no idea why… and why were they all standing outside the Headmaster’s forbidden door in the first place?And then…From behind where Harry stood…Came the growing sound of another set of footsteps, rapid and manyfold.Professor Snape stabbed his wand once, creating a burst of darknessthat shrouded where the Defense Professor was lying. “Muffliato,” the Potions Master hissed. “Mr. Potter, if you must be here, then hide! Put onyour invisibility cloak! My duty is to guard this door in case he comeshere. And there has been—a disturbance, meant to draw the Headmaster,he thinks—”“Who—”Severus took a long stride forward and snapped his wand against theside of Harry’s head. There was a trickling sensation like an egg had beencracked over him, the feeling of a Disillusionment Charm; and Harry’shands faded out, followed by the rest of him.The darkness shrouding one side of the wall dissipated like slow mist,and there was again visible the huddled form of the Defense Professor,who said nothing.Harry tiptoed away quietly as he could, then turned to watch.The approaching footsteps rounded the corner—“What are you doing here?” came many simultaneous cries.Trimmed in three sets of Slytherin green and one Hufflepuff yellowstood Theodore Nott, Daphne Greengrass, Susan Bones, and TraceyDavis.“Where,” said Professor Snape with mounting wrath, “are your escorts,children? First-years must be accompanied by a sixth or seventh-year student at all times! Especially you!”Theodore Nott raised his hand. “We’re, um,” said Theodore Nott.“We’re doing what the Chaos Legion calls a team-building exercise… see,we realized just now that none of us had tried the Headmaster’s forbid* 1676 *den chamber yet, and there wasn’t much time left… and Harry Potter hasauthorized it, Professor, he said specifically that you mustn’t interfere.”Severus Snape turned to glance over at where Harry Potter had tiptoed; a storm seemed to be gathering on his brow, and a dark fury in hiseyes.I… maybe? There was still one hour left on Harry’s Time-Turner, so itwas possible.“Harry Potter does not have that authority,” the Potions Master saidin a deceptively mild tone. “Explain yourselves, now.”“Really?” said the form of Susan Bones. “Really? You’re telling Professor Snape that Harry Potter authorized the mission, that’s your idea of abluff?” The young Hufflepuff turned to Professor Snape and spoke, hervoice strangely firm. “Professor, this is the truth and it’s urgent. DracoMalfoy is missing and we think he went down there—”“If Mr. Malfoy is missing,” said Professor Snape, “why have the Aurorsnot been notified?”“Because of, because of reasons!” cried Daphne Greengrass. “There’sno time, you’ve got to let us through!”Professor Snape’s voice was now as sardonic as Harry had ever heardit. “Are you four morons under the impression that you are on some sortof adventure? Well, you are mistaken. I assure you that Mr. Malfoy hasnot passed through this door.”“We think Mr. Malfoy has an invisibility cloak,” Susan Bones saidrapidly. “Do you remember the door seeming to open for no reason?”“No,” the Potions Master said. “Now be gone from here. This place isoff-limits for today.”“This is Dumbledore’s forbidden corridor,” Tracey said. “The Headmaster himself said nobody was to come here. Who do you think you are, forbidding it too?”“Miss Davis,” said the Potions Master, “you need to stop associatingwith Gryffindors, especially those named Lavender Brown. And if you arestill here in one minute, I will file papers requesting your transfer intothat House.”“You wouldn’t dare!” shrieked Tracey.“Hm,” Susan Bones said, her face screwed up in concentration. “Professor Snape, do you occasionally open the door yourself, to check onwhatever’s inside?”Professor Snape froze in place. Then he spun and put his right handon the metal knocker—Harry was watching the hand on the knocker, so he didn’t notice whatProfessor Snape was doing with his left hand until he heard the suddenoutcry.“No, in fact,” said Professor Snape, now holding the choking head ofDraco Malfoy by his collar, though the rest of Draco was still underneathhis invisibility cloak. “A fine try, though.”“What?” cried Tracey and Daphne.Susan Bones hit herself in the forehead. “I can’t believe I fell for that.”“So, Mr. Malfoy,” Professor Snape said. His voice had lowered. “Yousent your friends here on a ruse… just in the hopes that you could passthrough this door? Now why would you do that?”“I think we should trust him—” said Theodore Nott. “Mr. Malfoy,we’ve got to trust him, he’s the one Professor who would take our side!”“No!” cried Draco’s floating head, from where Professor Snape wasstill grasping his collar. “You mustn’t say anything! Stop!”“We’ve got to take the chance!” yelled Theodore. “Professor Snape,Mr. Malfoy finally worked out what’s been going on this whole year, andwhy—Dumbledore is trying to get the Philosopher’s Stone away fromNicholas Flamel! Because Dumbledore doesn’t think anyone ought tohave immortality! So Dumbledore tried to convince Flamel that the DarkLord was coming back and needed the Stone to revive, and asked Flamelto give it to him, but Flamel wouldn’t, and instead Flamel put the Stonein the magic mirror that’s down there, and Dumbledore is finding outright now how to get it, and then he’ll come for it and we’ve got to get to itfirst! Dumbledore really will be all-powerful if he gets the Philosopher’sStone!”“What?” said Tracey. “That’s not what you said before!”“It—” Daphne said. She looked frightened, but determined. “Itdoesn’t matter—Professor Snape, please, you have to believe me. Ilooked at the books Hermione checked out of the library, and she wasresearching the Philosopher’s Stone just before someone killed her. Hernotes said that something dangerous might happen if the Stone staysinside the mirror too long. We have to get it out of the castle right away.”Susan Bones now had both hands over her face. “I’m not with them, Ijust came along to prevent anything even stupider from happening.”Severus Snape was staring at Theodore Nott and the others. Then heturned his head to look at Draco Malfoy. “Mr. Malfoy,” the Potions Masterdrawled. “How did you come to discover Dumbledore’s plot?”“I deduced it from evidence!” said Draco Malfoy’s floating head.Professor Snape’s head swiveled back to Theodore Nott. “How didyou intend to obtain this Stone from inside a magic mirror that couldsupposedly baffle Dumbledore himself? Answer me at once!”“We’re going to take the whole mirror and send it back to Flamel,” saidTheodore Nott. “It’s not like we want the Stone for ourselves, we just needto stop Dumbledore from stealing it.”Professor Snape nodded, as though confirming something, andturned his head to look at the other students. “Tell me, have any of younoticed one of the others behaving in an unusual fashion? Especiallyif there is a peculiar object that they have in their possession, or theycan use spells a first-year should not know?” Professor Snape’s righthand now pointed his wand at Susan Bones. “I see that Miss Greengrassand Miss Davis are trying not to look at you, Miss Bones. If there is amundane explanation, you would be wise to offer it immediately.”Susan Bones’s hair turned bright red, though her face didn’t change.“I suppose there’s not much point keeping it mum any longer,” she said,“since I’m graduating in two days anyway.”“Double witches get to graduate six years early?” said Tracey Davis.“That’s not fair!”“Bones is a double witch?” cried Theodore.“No, she is Nymphadora Tonks, a Metamorphmagus,” ProfessorSnape said. “Masquerading as another student is extremely againstregulation, as you are well aware, Miss Tonks. It is not too late to expelyou from Hogwarts two days before your graduation, which would be adreadful tragedy—from your perspective, that is. From my perspectiveit would be hilarious. Now tell me what exactly you are doing here.”“That explains it,” said Daphne Greengrass. “Um, is there actually aSusan Bones, or is the House dying out so they had you secretly—”The red-haired form of Susan Bones had a palm to her face. “Yes, MissGreengrass, there’s a real Susan Bones. She only sends me in when youlot are about to get into ridiculous amounts of trouble. Professor Snape,the reason I’m here is because Draco Malfoy was missing, and this lotinsisted on trying to find him instead of calling the Aurors. For reasonsthe real Miss Bones said there was no time to explain to me, which I nowrealize were stupid. But young students must never go alone, and mustbe accompanied by a sixth or seventh year at all times. And now we foundDraco Malfoy and we can all go back. Please? Before this gets any moreridiculous?”“What in Merlin’s name is going on here?”“Ah,” said Professor Snape, who was still pointing the wand at the redhaired form of Susan Bones, his other hand still grasping the collar belowthe disembodied head of Draco Malfoy, standing next to the crumpledform of the Defense Professor. “Professor Sprout, I perceive.”“It’s not what it looks like,” volunteered Tracey Davis.The short, dumpy form of the Herbology Professor stormed forwards.She had, by this point, drawn her wand, though she wasn’t pointing it atanyone. “I don’t even know what this looks like! Down wands, all of you, rightnow! Including you, Professor!”Distraction. The thought came to Harry with sudden clarity. Whateverhe was watching now, from where he stood invisibly and well back of theaction, it wasn’t what was really going on, it wasn’t the true thread of thestory, it had been arranged. Professor Sprout’s arrival had broken Harry’ssuspension of disbelief; things like that didn’t happen just for the sakeof comedic coincidence. Someone was deliberately causing all this chaos,but what was the point?Harry really hoped he hadn’t gone back in time and done this, becauseit did seem like the sort of thing he would do.Severus Snape lowered his wand. His other hand unfisted Draco Malfoy. “Professor Sprout,” the Potions Master said, “I am here on the Headmaster’s orders to watch this door. Everyone else present is not supposedto be here, and I ask you to see them cleared away.”“A likely story,” snapped Professor Sprout. “Why would Dumbledoreset you of all people to guard the door to his playground? It’s not as if hewants to keep the students out, oh no, they need to go in and get stuckin my Devil’s Snare! Susan, dear, you’ve got a communications mirror,don’t you? Use it to call the Aurors.”The watching Harry nodded to himself. That was the point. The Aurors would take away everyone present at this terribly confusing situation, no excuses accepted, and then the door would be unguarded.But was Harry meant to go into the forbidden corridor himself? Orwatch, to see who finally came once all the others were gone?A loud fit of hacking and coughing caused everyone to look at wherethe Defense Professor lay.“Snape—listen—” said the Defense Professor between coughs.“Why—Sprout—here—”The Potions Master looked down.“Memory Charm—implies—Professor—” The Defense Professor began coughing again.“What?”And the logic unfolded in Harry’s mind in crystalline dismay, all thesteps already suspected, the dreadful realization coming as a repetitionwith greater confidence.Someone had Memory-Charmed Hermione to believe she’d tried tokill Draco.Only a Hogwarts Professor could have done it without alarm.So all the true mastermind needed to do was Legilimise or Imperiusa Hogwarts Professor.And the last person anyone would suspect would be the Head ofHouse Hufflepuff.Snape’s head snapped around, as Professor Sprout raised her wand,and the Potions Master managed to raise a wordless translucent ward between them. But the bolt that shot from Professor Sprout’s wand was adark brown that produced a surge of awful apprehension in Harry’s mind;and the brown bolt made Severus’s shield wink out before they touched,clipping the Potions Master’s right arm even as he dodged. ProfessorSnape gave a muffled shriek and his hand spasmed, dropping his wand.1681 *The next bolt that came from Sprout’s wand was a bright red the colorof a Stunning Hex, seeming to grow brighter and move faster even as itleft her wand, accompanied by another surge of anxiety; and that blew thePotions Master into the door, dropping him motionless to the ground.By that time pink-haired-Susan-Bones was surrounded by a multifaceted blue haze and she was firing hex after hex at Professor Sprout.Professor Sprout was ignoring the hexes to summon plant tendrils thatentangled the younger students as they tried to run, except Draco Malfoy,who had again vanished beneath his invisibility cloak.Not-Susan-Bones stopped casting hexes. She leveled her wand, tooka deep breath, and cried aloud an incantation that sent golden worms oflight chewing into the shield around Professor Sprout. At that the Herbology Professor turned to face not-Susan, her expression vacant, a new setof plant tentacles rising in the air behind her. Those stalks were a darkergreen, and seemed to have shields of their own.Harry Potter murmured to the seemingly empty air, “Attack Sprout.Help Bones. Nonlethal only.”“Yes, my lord,” whispered Lesath Lestrange beneath Harry’s Cloak ofInvisibility, and the fifth-year Slytherin’s presence moved off toward thefight.Harry looked down at at his own hands, and saw with a jolt of unpleasant shock that his Disillusionment Charm wasn’t as complete as it hadbeen before. There were hints of distortion in the air, each time Harrymoved…Slowly, Harry stepped backward, until he came to a corner, andducked behind a wall. Then he took out his communications mirror…which was blank and jammed. Of course. Harry levitated the mirror towhere he could use it to see around the corner, and watch the end of the…distraction? What was happening, why?Professor Sprout and the form of Susan Bones were dueling in flashesof light and leaves; and the blazing green of a Greater Drill Hex eruptedfrom midair and chewed halfway through the outer layer of ProfessorSprout’s shields. The Herbology Professor turned and fired a broad washof yellow at where the Drill Hex had come from, but the spell didn’t seemto hit anything.Yellow blazes, blue facets, dark green plant-tendrils and swirling purple flower petals…It was when Professor Sprout started firing arcs of crimson in all directions that one of the crimson blades caught something in midair, theInvisibility Cloak not concealing how the crimson arc was absorbed andwinked out; and Lesath’s presence beneath the Invisibility Cloak fell tothe ground.And that gave not-Susan-Bones time enough to stand still, catchher breath, and scream something that inspired in Harry another surgeof dread; and the white spark that blazed out went through ProfessorSprout’s chewed shields and her plant-armor and dropped her.Not-Susan-Bones went to her knees, panting, her robes soaked insweat.Her head turned to look around her, at the bodies lying stunned onthe floor or wrapped in vines.“What,” said not-Susan. “What. What. What.”There was no reply. The victims entangled in Professor Sprout’s vinesweren’t moving, though they did seem to be breathing.“Malfoy…” said the pink-haired form of Susan, still gasping for breath.“Draco Malfoy, where are you? Are you there? Call the Aurors already!Merlin damn it—Homenum Revelio!”And Harry found himself visible again, staring in his mirror at theform of Draco Malfoy half-visible beneath a shimmering cloak, standingbehind not-Susan, pointing his wand at a gap in not-Susan’s blue haze.Harry’s mind moved in flashes of insight, too slow and yet too fast;even as Harry’s mouth opened and he inhaled in preparation to shout.beware the constellationthere was a constellation named Dracoif you could control a Professor you could control a student“Duck!”Harry shouted, but it was too late, a bolt of red light caught theback of not-Susan’s head at point-blank, smashing her to the floor.Harry stepped around the corner and said, “Somnium Somnium Somnium Somnium Somnium Somnium.”Draco Malfoy’s shimmering form collapsed in a heap.Harry took a moment to catch his breath. Then Harry said “Stupefy!”and verified that, yes, the Stunning Hex did hit Draco Malfoy’s form.(You could be mistaken about whether a Somnium had really hit.Harry had seen enough horror movies, not to mention the business withthe Sunshine Regiment, that he wasn’t about to make that error again.)After a further reflection on this, Harry cast another Stunning Hexinto the prostrate form of Professor Sprout.Harry gripped his wand, staring at the scene, breathing heavily fromthe exhaustion. He didn’t have enough magic left to cast a messengerPatronus to Dumbledore and he really really should have thought of thatpossibility immediately this time around. Harry started to reach back towhere his mirror had fallen, to see if it was now unjammed.And then Harry hesitated.His note to himself had said to avoid notice from Aurors, and Harrystill did not know what was going on.The crumpled form of Professor Quirrell gave another series of racking coughs, reached out a hand to the wall beside him, and slowly pulledhimself to his feet.“Harry,” croaked Professor Quirrell. “Harry. Are you there?”It was the first time Professor Quirrell had ever called him by his firstname.“I’m here,” Harry said. Without any conscious thought, his feet weremoving forward.“Please,” said Professor Quirrell. “Please, I haven’t… much time.Please take me… to the mirror… help me… get the Stone.”“The Philosopher’s Stone?” Harry said. He glanced around at thescattered bodies, but he couldn’t see Draco anymore, the revealmenthad worn off. “You think Mr. Nott was right? I don’t think Dumbledorewould—”“Not—Dumbledore,” gasped Professor Quirrell. “Because—Sprout—”“I understand,” Harry said. If Dumbledore had been the one behindit all, he wouldn’t have needed to mind-control a Professor in order to useMemory Charms.“Mirror… ancient relic… could hide anything… Stone could be there…many others want Stone… one sent Sprout…”Harry repeated rapidly, “The mirror down there is an ancient relicthat can be used to hide things, and it would be one possible place to hidethe Philosopher’s Stone. If the Philosopher’s Stone is inside the mirrorthen any number of people might want to get it. One of them is controlling Sprout and that would explain what their goal really is… only… thatdoesn’t explain why Sprout’s controller would go after Hermione?”“Harry, please,” Professor Quirrell said. His breathing was yet morelabored now, his voice came with excruciating slowness. “It’s the onething… that can save my life… and I find, now… I don’t want to die… please,help me…”And somehow that tore it.Somehow that was a little too much.The sense of detachment that had come over Harry when ProfessorSprout had arrived, the broken suspension of disbelief, was returning; hisInner Critic weighing up everything as though it were a set-piece. Timing, probability, so many people showing up at the same door, the Defense Professor’s desperation… this whole situation didn’t feel real. Buthe might be able to solve it if he just took time to think things through inadvance, instead of running off at adventure’s first call. All the accumulated experience from the last year had finally crystallized into somethinglike a touch of battle hardening. An instinct born of past disaster wastelling Harry that if he just rushed on ahead, he would end up afterwardin a sad conversation, realizing that he’d been stupid. Again.“Let me think,” Harry said. “Let me think for a minute before we go.”He turned away from the Defense Professor, looking at the unconsciousbodies draped in various shapes over the floor. There’d been so many puzzle pieces already, this last year, maybe everything would just fall intoplace with one more piece…“Harry…” the Defense Professor said in a faltering voice. “Harry, I’mdying…”One more minute can’t make the difference he’s had the WHOLE YEAR to besick it’s IMPROBABLE that his life versus death would be precisely timed to reston this last minute no matter what happened to Hermione—“I know!” Harry said. “I’ll think quickly!”Harry stared at the bodies and tried to think. There was no timefor doubts, for caveats, no brakes or second-guessing just take the firstthoughts and run with them—In the back of Harry’s mind, fragments of abstract thought flittedpast, heuristics of problem-solving that there was no time to rehearse inwords. In wordless flashes they shot past, to set up the object-level problem.—what do I notice I am confused by——the first place to look for a problem is whatever aspect of the situation seemsmost improbable——simple explanations are more probable, eliminate separate improbabilitiesthat must be postulated—Professor Snape had already been here then Professor Quirrell hadarrived then Harry had arrived (via Time-Turner) then the adventuringparty had arrived and Draco had been revealed (part of the party) thenProfessor Sprout had shown up.Too many people had shown up synchronously and that was too muchcoincidence, it was improbable that so many different parties would showup at the same location within a five-minute window, there had to be hidden entanglements.Label Sprout’s controller as the mastermind who had ordered Hermione Memory-Charmed. The mastermind had sent Sprout.Professor Snape had said that the Headmaster had sent him to guardthe door after there’d been some sort of disturbance, if the mastermindhad caused that as a distraction then that explained Severus’s presenceas well.Harry wasn’t sure any more that Draco had been controlled by themastermind, that hypothesis had come to him in the spur of the moment,Draco might have just been trying to drop not-Susan so he could get intothe corridor unhindered—No that was the wrong way to think, turn it around, try to explainthe timed presence of Draco and his adventuring party, no time for selfquestioning, run with the hypothesis, therefore suppose Sprout’s mastermind had sent Draco or triggered his coming.That was three arrivals explained.Harry had shown up because his note to himself had told him to doso. That could be attributed to time travel.That left the Defense Professor who’d said he was following Snape,only that didn’t really seem like an adequate reason for Professor Quirrellto show up it didn’t really make Harry feel less confused and so maybe themastermind had also controlled the timing of Professor Quirrell’s presence somehow and even arranged for Harry himself to enter the timeloop.Harry’s mind hit a stumbling-block, he couldn’t see how to extendthat reasoning further.There was no time to stare blankly at stumbling-blocks.Without any pause or braking Harry’s mind attacked the problemfrom a new angle.Professor Quirrell had deduced a controlled Hogwarts Professor fromthe need for some Professor to Memory-Charm Hermione which meantthat Professor Sprout’s controller had framed and then murdered Hermione which meant Professor Sprout’s controller had detailed informationabout Hogwarts life and maybe a personal interest in the Boy-Who-Livedand his friends.Harry’s mind finally threw up the relevant memory, Dumbledore saying that Lord Voldemort’s strongest road to life was hidden here insideHogwarts run with the hypothesis so that resurrection tool was the Philosopher’s Stone hidden inside the mirror why had Dumbledore put the mirrorinto a corridor first-years could get through no ignore this question it’s not important right now and Professor Quirrell had said the Philosopher’s Stonepossessed great healing power so that part also fit.But if it was the Philosopher’s Stone that was hidden in the mirror tokeep it away from the Dark Lord, that meant the mirror also containedthe one thing in the world that could save the Defense Professor’s life—Harry’s mind tried to hesitate, to flinch away, feeling a sudden apprehension as to where this was going.But there was no time allowed for hesitation.-and that was also far too much coincidence just too much improbability if your mind didn’t write it off as an amazing plot twist like youwere inside a story.Could the putative Dark Lord also be manipulating Professor Quirrellso that Professor Quirrell would discover his supposed salvation at theright time so that Harry and Professor Quirrell would go get the resurrection tool from the mirror that might not even actually be the Philosopher’s Stone and then the Dark Lord’s avatar or some other servant wouldshow up and seize it from them that would explain all the synchroniesand negate every coincidence.Or Professor Quirrell had known from the beginning that the onething that could save his life was hidden inside this mirror and that waswhy he had agreed to teach Defense at Hogwarts and now he was finallytrying to get it but then why wait until he was this sick to even try andwhy had Sprout shown up at the same time as Professor Quirrell—Harry’s mind faltered harder.His inner eye was looking in a direction it was afraid to look.The note I sent myself said to help the watcher of stars. I wouldn’t send myselfa note saying that, if I hadn’t already worked out in the future that it was the rightthing to do—maybe the note is just telling me to get on with it—A small note of confusion was promoted to conscious attention.The coded message on the parchment… one or two lines hadn’t quitesounded right, hadn’t sounded like the code Harry would expect himselfto use…“Harry,” whispered the dying voice of Professor Quirrell from behindhim. “Harry, please.”“I’m almost done thinking,” Harry’s voice said aloud, and Harry realized as he spoke the words that they were true.Turn it around.Look at it from the Enemy’s perspective, from where the Enemy doestheir own intelligent planning, somewhere out of your sight.There are Aurors in Hogwarts, and your target Harry Potter is nowfully on guard. Harry Potter will call in Aurors at the first sign of trouble,or send a Patronus to Albus Dumbledore. Considering that as a puzzle,one creative solution is to——forge a supposedly Time-Turned message to Harry Potter fromhimself, telling Harry Potter not to call for help, telling him to be at theplace and time you want him to be. You get the target himself to bypassall the protections he set up. You even bypass his protection of skepticismwith the overriding authority of his own future self’s judgment.It isn’t even difficult. You can Memory-Charm some random studentinto remembering Harry Potter handing over an envelope to be givenback to himself later.You can Memory-Charm that student because you are a HogwartsProfessor.You don’t go to the extra effort to steal a pencil and Muggle paper fromHarry Potter’s pouch. Instead you forge Harry Potter’s handwriting onwizard parchment. You can forge Harry Potter’s handwriting becauseyou have seen it on Ministry-mandated exams you have graded.You call Draco Malfoy ‘the constellation’ because you know Harry Potter is interested in astronomy and you are a wizard and you have takenAstronomy and memorised the names of all the constellations. But it’snot the natural code that Harry Potter would use to describe Draco Malfoy to himself, that would have been ‘the apprentice’.You call Professor Quirrell ‘the watcher of stars’, and tell Harry Potterto help him.You know that life-eater is how you say ‘Dementor’ in Parseltongueand you expect Harry Potter to think of the Aurors as being in league withthem.You encode 6:49 as ‘six, and seven in a square’ because you have beenreading a Muggle physics book that Harry Potter gave you.Who are you, then?Harry noticed his breathing had sped up, and with a burst ofheartrate, Harry slowed his breath down again, Professor Quirrell waswatching him.What if hypothetically speaking Professor Quirrell was the mastermind and had faked Harry’s message then that explained all five partiesshowing up the whole synchronous coordination of the comedy and thenProfessor Sprout was just controlled to give Professor Quirrell deniabilitylet him blame someone else for the False Memory Charm after the dustsettled butBut why would Professor Quirrell risk the fragile alliance Harry hadwith Draco via the attempted murder-frame(that Professor Quirrell had ‘detected’ and ‘stopped’ allegedly via atracer put on Draco)Why would Professor Quirrell kill Hermione(if his first attempt to remove her hadn’t worked)If Professor Quirrell was the bad guy then he might have lied about everything to do with horcruxes and maybe it wasn’t coincidence at all thatthe only thing that could save his life was the avenue that could resurrectthe Dark Lord what if the Dark Lord had arranged that too somehow(one day David Monroe had mysteriously disappeared, presumeddead at the Dark Lord’s hands)An awful intuition had come over Harry, something separate from allthe reasoning he’d done so far, an intuition that Harry couldn’t put intowords; except that he and the Defense Professor were very much alikein certain ways, and faking a Time-Turned message was just the sort ofcreative method that Harry himself might have tried to bypass all of atarget’s protections—And that was when Harry finally realized what should have been obvious from the very, very beginning.Professor Quirrell was smart.Professor Quirrell was smart in the same way as Harry.Professor Quirrell was smart in exactly the same way as Harry’s mysterious dark side.If you had to guess when the Boy-Who-Lived had acquired his mysterious dark side, the obvious guess was the night of October 31st, 1981.AndAndAnd Professor Quirrell had known a password that Bellatrix Black hadthought identified the Dark Lord and his presence gave the Boy-Who* 1690 *Lived a sense of doom and his magic interacted destructively with Harry’sand his favorite spell was Avada Kedavra and and and—The realization blasted through Harry like a vast dam breaking, releasing out all its water, bursting through his mind in an irresistible floodthat swept everything away.There is only one reality that generates all of the observations.If different observations seem to point in incompatible directions, itmeans the true hypothesis is one you haven’t thought of yet.And in those cases, when you finally think of the correct hypothesis,everything aligns behind it, beyond denial or horror, tearing away everydoubt and every emotion that might stand in its path.—and then ‘David Monroe’ and ‘Lord Voldemort’ had just been oneperson playing both sides of the Wizarding War and that was why theMonroe family had been killed before they could meet ‘David Monroe’ justlike Moody had suspected—Reality settled down into a single known state, one coherent state-ofaffairs that compactly generated the observation set.Harry didn’t jump, didn’t change his breathing, tried not to show asingle sign of the horror and agony flooding his mind.The Enemy was behind him, watching him.“All right,” Harry said out loud, as soon as he dared trust his voiceto sound normal. He kept on staring at the bodies, looking away fromProfessor Quirrell, because Harry didn’t trust his own face. Harry lifted asleeve to wipe away the sweat on his forehead, trying to make the gesturelook casual; Harry couldn’t control the sweat, or the rapid hammering inhis chest. “Let’s go get the Philosopher’s Stone.”All Harry needed was a single moment of distraction anywhere alongthe way to use his Time-Turner.There was no reply from behind him.The silence stretched.Slowly, Harry turned around.Professor Quirrell was standing upright and smiling.In the Defense Professor’s hand was a shape of black metal pointed atHarry’s wand arm, held with the sure grip of someone who knew exactlyhow to use a semiautomatic handgun.1691 *Harry’s mouth was dry, even his lips were trembling with adrenaline,but he managed to speak. “Hello, Lord Voldemort.”Professor Quirrell inclined his head in acknowledgement, and said,“Hello, Tom Riddle.”om Riddle.The words seemed to echo inside Harry’s head, sparking resonances that as quickly died away, broken patterns trying to completethemselves and failing.Tom Riddle is aTom Riddle was theRiddleThere were other priorities occupying Harry’s attention.Professor Quirrell was pointing a gun at him.And for some reason Lord Voldemort hadn’t fired it yet.Harry’s voice came out in more of a croak. “What is it that you wantfrom me?”“Your death,” said Professor Quirrell, “is clearly not what I am about tosay, since I have had plenty of time to kill you if I wished. The fateful battlebetween Lord Voldemort and the Boy-Who-Lived is a figment of Dumbledore’s imagination. I know where to find your family’s house in Oxford,and I am familiar with the concept of sniper rifles. You would have diedbefore you ever touched a wand. I hope this is clear to you, Tom?”“Crystal,” Harry whispered. His body was still shaking, running programs more suited to fleeing a tiger than casting delicate spells or thinking. But Harry could think of one thing the person pointing a gun at himobviously wanted him to do, a question that person was waiting for himto ask, and Harry did so. “Why are you calling me Tom?”Professor Quirrell regarded him steadily. “Why am I calling you Tom?Answer. Your intellect is not everything I hoped for, but it should sufficefor this.”Harry’s mouth seemed to know the answer before his brain couldmanage to focus on the question. “Tom Riddle is your name. Our name.That’s who Lord Voldemort is, or was, or—something.”Professor Quirrell nodded. “Better. You have already vanquished theDark Lord, the one and only time that you will ever do so. I have alreadydestroyed all but a remnant of Harry Potter, eliminating the differencebetween our spirits and enabling us to reside in the same world. Now thatit is clear to you that the battle between us is a lie, you might act sensibly toadvance your own interests. Or you might not.” The gun jabbed slightlyforward, causing prickles of sweat to appear on Harry’s forehead. “Dropyour wand. Now.”Harry dropped it.“Step away from the wand,” said Professor Quirrell.Harry obeyed.“Reach toward your neck,” said Professor Quirrell, “and remove yourTime-Turner, touching it by the chain only. Place the Time-Turner on theground, then step away from it as well.”This also Harry did. Even in his state of shock, his mind still looked fora way to spin the Time-Turner in the process, a sudden move that wouldwin; but Harry knew that Professor Quirrell would already be imagininghimself in Harry’s position, looking for the same possible opportunities.“Remove your pouch and place it also on the ground, then step away.”Harry did this.“Very good,” said the Defense Professor. “Now. It is time for me to obtain the Philosopher’s Stone. I mean to bring along these four first-yearshere, suitably Obliviated of their most recent memories so that they stillrecall their original purpose. Snape I shall control and set to guard thisdoor. After this day’s work is done, I intend to kill Snape for the betrayals he has offered my other identity. The three heir-children I shall takewith me afterwards, to shape their future loyalties. And know this, I havetaken hostages. I have already set in motion a spell that will kill hundredsof Hogwarts students, including many you called friends. I can stop thatspell using the Stone, if I obtain it successfully. If I am interrupted before then, or if I choose not to stop the spell, hundreds of students willdie.” Professor Quirrell’s voice was still mild. “Do you yet perceive anyinterests you have at stake, boy? I would smile to hear you say ‘no’, butthat is too much to hope.”“I’d like,” Harry managed to say, through the horror, and the heartbreak, and the knives slicing away at an emotional connection that hurtlike living flesh as it was cut, “for you not to do those things, Professor.”Why, Professor Quirrell, why, why did it have to turn out like this, I don’t, I don’t,I don’t want this to be happening…“Very well,” Professor Quirrell said. “I grant you permission to offer me something I want.” The gun gestured invitingly. “That is a rareprivilege, child. Lord Voldemort does not usually negotiate for what hewants.”Some part of Harry’s mind scrabbled frantically, looking for something, anything that might be of more value to Lord Voldemort or Professor Quirrell than child hostages or Severus’s death.Another part of him, the part that had never stopped thinking, alreadyknew his answer.“You already have an idea for what you want from me,” Harry said,through the sickness and the bleeding wounds in his soul. “What is it?”“Your help in obtaining the Philosopher’s Stone.”Harry swallowed. He couldn’t stop his eyes from going to the gun,then back up at Professor Quirrell’s face.He was aware that the hero in a storybook was supposed to say ‘No’,but now that he was actually in a situation like this, saying ‘No’ didn’tseem to make sense.“I am disappointed that you need to think about this,” said ProfessorQuirrell. “It is straightforward that you should obey me for now, since Ihold every advantage over you. I have taught you better than this; in thissituation you should certainly pretend to lose. You can expect to gainnothing by resisting, except pain. You should have calculated that it wasbetter to answer sooner, and not earn my distrust.” Professor Quirrell’seyes studied him curiously. “Perhaps Dumbledore has filled your earswith nonsense about noble defiance? I find such morals amusing, sincethey are so easy to manipulate. I assure you that I can make defianceseem morally worse, and you would be well advised to submit before Idemonstrate how.” The gun stayed pointed at Harry; but with a wave ofProfessor Quirrell’s other hand, Tracey Davis rose up into the air, spunlazily, her limbs stretched out spreadeagle——then, even as new adrenaline hammered at Harry’s heart, Traceyfloated back down again.“Choose,” said Professor Quirrell. “This begins to try my patience.”I should have spoken just then, before he might’ve ripped off Tracey’s legs, no,I shouldn’t have, the Headmaster said I mustn’t show Lord Voldemort that I’ll dothings if he threatens my friends because that will just make him threaten moreof them—only what he said before isn’t a threat it’s just the sort of thing LordVoldemort does—Harry took a deep breath, several of them. Whatever part of himkept on running on full automatic was screaming at the remainder of hismind that it could not afford to stay in shock. Shocks were of finite duration,neurons kept firing regardless, the only reason Harry’s mind would shutdown while his brain kept running was if Harry’s self-model believed hismind would shut down—“I don’t mean to try your patience,” Harry said. His voice was cracking. That was good. Sounding like he was still in shock meant that LordVoldemort might give him more time. “But if Lord Voldemort had a reputation for keeping his bargains, I don’t know about it.”“An obvious concern,” Professor Quirrell said. “There is a simple answer, and I would have enforced it upon you in any case. Ssnakes can't lie.And since I have a tremendous distaste for stupidity, I suggest you do notsay anything like ‘What do you mean?’ You are smarter than that, and Ido not have time for such conversations as ordinary people inflict on oneanother.”Harry swallowed. Snakes can’t lie. “Two pluss two equalss four.” Harryhad tried to say that two plus two equalled three, and the word four hadslipped out instead.“Good. When Salazar Slytherin invoked the Parselmouth curse uponhimself and all his children, his true plan was to ensure his descendantscould trust one another’s words, whatever plots they wove against outsiders.” Professor Quirrell had adopted his lecturing pose from BattleMagic, like someone putting on a well-worn mask, but the gun remainedpointed in his hand. “Occlumency cannot fool the Parselmouth curse asit can fool Veritaserum, and you may put that to the trial also. Now listen well. Come with me, promisse your besst aid in getting Sstone, and I sshall leavethesse children behind unharmed. Hosstagess are real, hundredss of sstudentss dietonight unlesss I sstop eventss already sset in motion. Will sspare hosstagess if I obtainSstone ssuccessfully. And mark also this, mark it well: I cannot be truly sslainby any power known to me, and lossing Sstone will not sstop me from returning, norsspare you or yourss my wrath. Any impetuous act you are contemplating cannot win the game for you, boy. I do credit your ability to annoy me, andsuggest you avoid doing so.”“You said,” Harry’s voice was strange in his own ears, “that the Philosopher’s Stone had different powers from what legend said. You said thatto me in Parseltongue. Tell me what the Stone really does, before I agreeto help you get it.” If it was something along the lines of gaining totalpower over the universe, then nothing was worth an incrementally greaterchance of Lord Voldemort getting the Stone.“Ah,” said Professor Quirrell, and smiled. “You are thinking. That isbetter, and as a reward I shall offer you a further incentive for cooperation. Eternal life and youth, the creation of gold and silver. Suppose theseare true benefits of holding the Stone. Tell me, boy. What is the Stone’spower?”It might have been the adrenaline still in him, being actually usefulfor his brain for once. It might have been the power of being told that ananswer existed, and that the evidence wasn’t a lie. “It can make Transfigurations permanent.”Then Harry stopped, as he heard what his own mouth had just said.“Correct,” said Professor Quirrell. “Thus, whoever holds the Philosopher’s Stone is able to perform human Transfiguration.”Harry’s torn mind was knocked about yet again, as he realized whatfurther incentive would be offered him.“You stole Miss Granger’s remains and Transfigured them into someinnocuous-appearing target,” said Professor Quirrell. “A Transfiguredtarget that you must keep somewhere about your own person, in order tosustain the Transfiguration. Ah, I see your eyes going to that ring uponyour hand, but of course Miss Granger would not be the little jewel setinto the ring, would it? That would be too obvious. No, I expect youTransfigured Granger’s remains into the ring itself, letting the aura ofthe Transfigured jewel mask the magic in the Transfigured ring.”“Yes,” Harry said, forcing out the word. It was a lie, for once, andHarry’s glance had been deliberate. Harry had expected someone to challenge him on the steel ring, he’d tried to provoke that challenge so hecould prove to be innocent yet again, though nobody had taken him upon it—maybe Dumbledore had just sensed that the steel by itself wasn’tmagical.“Fine and good,” said Professor Quirrell. “Now come with me, helpme to obtain the Stone, and I will resurrect Hermione Granger on yourbehalf. Her death has had unfortunate effects on you, and I would notmind undoing them. That, as I understand you, is your greatest desire. Ihave done you many kindnesses, and I would not mind doing you this onemore.” A blank-eyed Professor Sprout had now risen from the groundand was pointing her own wand at Harry. “Help me obtain Sstone of Transsﬁguration, and I sshall try my hardesst to ressurrect your girl-child friend to true andlassting life. That ssaid, boy, I am sswiftly running out of patience with you, and yousshall not like what comess next.” This last line was hissed out in a voice thatconveyed the impression of a snake rearing its head to strike.Even then.Even then, with all the world upturned, with shock after shock, eventhen Harry’s brain did not stop being a brain, or completing the patternsits circuits had been wired to complete.Harry knew that this was too good an offer to make to someone atwhom you were pointing a gun.Unless you desperately needed their help to get the Philosopher’s Stoneout of the magic mirror.And there wasn’t any time left to plan, only the thought that, if Professor Quirrell really was going this far to get his help—what Harry wantedwas to demand Professor Quirrell promise not to kill anyone in the future in exchange for his help now, but Harry had a strong sense that Professor Quirrell would reply ‘Don’t be ridiculous’ and there wasn’t timefor ordinary conversation Harry had to guess the highest safe request inadvance—Professor Quirrell’s eyes narrowed, his lips parted—“If I help you,” Harry’s mouth said, “I want your promise that youaren’t planning to turn on me when this is over. I want you to not killProfessor Snape or anyone else in Hogwarts for at least a week. And Iwant answers, the truth about everything that’s been going on this wholetime, everything you know about my nature.”The pale blue eyes regarded him dispassionately.I really think we could have thought of something better to ask for than that,said Harry’s Slytherin side. But I suppose we were legitimately out of time, andwhatever we need to do next, answers will help.Harry wasn’t listening to that voice right now. Cold chills were stillgoing down his spine from hearing the words that had just come out ofhis lips, addressed to the man with the gun.“That is your condition for helping me to obtain the Stone?” said Professor Quirrell.Harry nodded, unable to form words.“Agreed,” hissed Professor Quirrell. “Help me, and you sshall have ansswerssto your quesstions, sso long ass they are about passt eventss, and not my planss forthe future. I do not intend to raisse my hand or magic againsst you in future, sso longass you do not raisse your hand or magic againsst me. Sshall kill none within sschoolgroundss for a week, unlesss I musst. Now promisse that you will not attempt to warnagainsst me or esscape. Promisse to put forth your own besst efforts toward helpingme to obtain the Sstone. And your girl-child friend sshall be revived by me, to truelife and health; nor sshall me or mine ever sseek to harm her.” A twisted smile.“Promisse, boy, and the bargain will be sstruck.”“I promise,” whispered Harry.WHAT? screamed other parts of his mind.Um, he’s still pointing a gun at us, pointed out Slytherin. We don’t actuallyhave a choice, we’re just getting as much mileage out of this as possible.You bastard, said Hufflepuff. Do you think this is what Hermione wouldhave wanted? This is Lord Voldemort we’re talking about, do we even know howmany people he’s killed, and will kill?I deny that we are compromising with Lord Voldemort for Hermione’s sake,said Slytherin. Since there is, in fact, a gun and we can’t otherwise stop him.Also, Mum and Dad would want us to just go along and stay safe.Professor Quirrell regarded him steadily. “Repeat the full promise inParseltongue, boy.”“I sshall help you obtain the Sstone… I cannot promisse I will usse my besst efforts,my heart will not be in it, I fear. I intend to try. Sshall not do anything I think willannoy you to no good end. Sshall call no help if I expect them to be killed by you orfor hosstagess to die. I'm ssorry, teacher, but it iss besst I can do.” Harry’s mindwas settling, composing itself, as the decision was made. He would staywith Professor Quirrell, go with him to get the Stone, save the studenthostages, and… and… and Harry didn’t know, except that he’d go on thinking.“You actually are sorry about that?” Professor Quirrell looked amused.“I suppose it shall have to do. Then keep two other things in mind: I haveplan to sstop even sschoolmasster, if he appearss before uss. And also this: I willoccasionally ask you to say in Parseltongue whether you have betrayedme. The bargain is sstruck.”After that, Professor Sprout picked up Harry’s wand, and wrapped it inshimmering cloth; then she placed it on the floor, and again pointed herwand at Harry. Only then did Professor Quirrell lower his gun, whichseemed to disappear into his hand, and pick up Harry’s wrapped wand,tucking it into his robes.The True Cloak of Invisibility was removed from the sleeping form ofLesath Lestrange, and Professor Quirrell took the Cloak, as well as Harry’spouch and Time-Turner.Then Professor Quirrell cast a mass Obliviation followed by the massversion of the False Memory Charm, the one that just had the subject fillin the blanks using their own suggestibility, on all the students present.Afterwards Professor Sprout floated away the sleeping children, nowwearing an expression that seemed annoyed and preoccupied, as ifthey’d been in some Herbology accident.Professor Quirrell then turned back to where the Potions Master laysprawled, bent over and placed his wand on Professor Snape’s forehead.“Alienis nervus mobile lignum.”The Defense Professor stepped back, and began to move his left fingers in the air as though manipulating a puppet on strings.Professor Snape pushed himself up from the ground by smooth motions, and stood once more before the corridor door.“Alohomora,” Professor Quirrell said, pointing his wand at the forbidden door. The Defense Professor looked rather amused. “Would you dothe honors, boy?”Harry swallowed. He was once again having second thoughts, andthird thoughts.It was strange how you could do something even while knowing it wasthe wrong thing, not the selfish thing but the wrong thing to do on somedeeper level.But the man behind him was holding the gun; it had once more appeared in his hand at Harry’s hesitation.Harry laid his hand on the door-knocker, and took several deepbreaths, again composing his mind as best he could. Go through withit, don’t get shot, don’t let the hostages die, be there to optimize events,be there to watch for opportunities and stay capable of taking them. Itwasn’t a good choice, but all the other ones seemed worse.Harry pushed open the forbidden door, and stepped through.1701 *fter a single step into Dumbledore’s forbidden chamber, Harryshrieked and jumped back and collided with Professor Snape,sending the two of them down in a heap.Professor Snape picked himself up and resumed standing in front ofthe door. His head tracked to look at Harry. “I am guarding this doorat the Headmaster’s orders,” said Professor Snape in his usual sardonictones. “Be off with you at once, or I shall deduct House Points.”This was bone-chillingly creepy, but Harry’s attention was occupiedby the gigantic three-headed dog which had lunged forward, only to bestopped meters from Harry by the chains upon its three collars.“That—that—that—” Harry said.“Yes,” Professor Quirrell said from a ways behind him, “that is indeedthe usual occupant of that chamber, which is off-limits to all students,especially first-years.”“That’s not safe even by wizard standards!” Within the chamber, the enormous black beast gave a multi-voiced bellow, flecks of white saliva flyingfrom three fanged mouths.Professor Quirrell sighed. “It is enchanted not to eat students, justspit them back out through the door. Now, boy, how would you recommend that we deal with this dangerous creature?”“Uh,” Harry stuttered, trying to think over the continued roaring ofthe chamber’s guardian. “Uh. If it’s like the Cerberus from the Mugglelegend of Orpheus and Eurydice, then we have to sing it to sleep so wecan pass—”“Avada Kedavra.”The three-headed beast fell over.Harry looked back at Professor Quirrell, who was giving him a look ofextreme disappointment, as if to ask whether Harry had attended any ofhis classes, ever.“I sort of assumed,” Harry said, still trying to catch his breath, “thatgoing through this challenge in any way except the one used by first-years,might perhaps trigger an alarm.”“That is a lie, boy, you simply did not remember your lessons whenyou faced the occasion in true life. As for alarms, I have spent monthsbefuddling all the wards and tripsigns upon these chambers.”“Then why did you send me in first, exactly?”Professor Quirrell just smiled. It looked significantly more evil thanusual.“Never mind,” Harry said, and walked slowly into the chamber, hislimbs still shaking.The chamber was all of stone, illuminated by a pale blue light thatshone from arched nooks carved into the wall; as if the light of a greysky were passing through windows, though there were no windows. Atthe far end of the chamber was a wooden trapdoor upon the floor, witha single ring attached. In the middle of the chamber lay a gigantic deaddog with three lifeless heads.Harry turned toward one of the arched nooks and looked inside it.There was nothing there but the sourceless blue glow, so he walked overand looked in the next one, also scrutinizing the wall as he passed.“What,” said Professor Quirrell, “are you doing?”“Searching the room,” Harry said. “There could be a clue, or an inscription, or a key we’ll need later, or something—”“Are you serious, or are you deliberately trying to slow us down? Answer in Parseltongue.”Harry looked back. “Wass sseriouss,” hissed Harry. “Would have donessame if came by mysself.”Professor Quirrell briefly massaged his forehead. “I confess,” he said,“that your approach would serve you well in, say, exploring the tomb ofAmon-Set, so I will not quite call you an idiot, but still. The false puzzle,the outer form of the challenge, is a game meant for first-years. We simply go down through the trapdoor.”Beneath the trapdoor was a gigantic plant, something like an enormous dieffenbachia with wide leaves emerging from the central stemlike a spiral staircase, but darker-colored than a normal dieffenbachia,with tendril-like vines emerging from the central stem and hangingdown. The base spread out wide with bigger leaves and tendrils, asthough promising to cushion anyone’s fall. Beneath was another stonechamber like the first, with the same nooks like false arched windows,emitting the same grey-blue light.“The obvious thought is to fly down on the broomstick in my pouch, ortoss something heavy to see if those tendrils are traps,” Harry said, peering down. “But I’m guessing you’ll say that we just walk down the leaves.”They certainly looked like they were meant to be a spiral staircase.“After you,” said Professor Quirrell.Harry carefully put a foot down on a leaf and found that it indeed supported his weight. Then Harry took a last look around the room beforedeparting, to see if there was anything worth noticing.The enormous dead dog called enough attention to itself that it washard to focus on anything else.“Professor Quirrell,” Harry said, omitting the phrase your approach todealing with obstacles has certain drawbacks, “what if somebody looks in thedoor and sees that the Cerberus is dead?”“Then they have probably already noticed something wrong withSnape,” said Professor Quirrell. “But since you insist…” The DefenseProfessor walked over to the three-headed corpse and placed his wandagainst it. He began a Latin-sounding incantation that was accompaniedby a sense of rising apprehension, the Boy-Who-Lived feeling the DarkLord’s power as he always had.The last word spoken was “Inferius” and it was accompanied by a finalsurge of STOP, DON’T.And the three-headed dog rose to a stand, its six eyes dull and blank,turning to watch the door once more.Harry stared at the huge Inferius with a horrible sinking sensation inhis stomach, the third-worst feeling he’d ever felt in his life.He knew then that he’d seen and sensed this procedure before, onlywithout the spoken Latin.The centaur who’d confronted him in the Forbidden Forest was dead.The Defense Professor had hit it with a real Avada Kedavra, not a fakeone.Somewhere in the back of his mind, Harry had thought that if hecould just get Hermione back then he could return to the code of nobodydying, the ethic of Batman. Most people went through their whole liveswithout anyone getting killed on whatever adventures they had.And that was not to be.He hadn’t even noticed, the day he lost his last chance to win. Even ifHermione was resurrected, now, Harry wouldn’t have come through thewhole mess without anyone getting killed.He hadn’t even learned the centaur’s name.Harry said nothing aloud. The Defense Professor would either confirm the accusation in Parseltongue or lie in plain speech, and eitherway the Defense Professor would have more reason to suspect Harry’snext actions. But Harry knew that—although he didn’t know how hewould stop Professor Quirrell, although he didn’t dare any positive actof betrayal, maybe not even making the decision, until it was almost timeto win—there would never be an amicable settlement between him andLord Voldemort, for those two different spirits could not exist in thesame world.And it was like that resolution, that knowledge of opposition, invokeda strength from what Harry had thought of as his dark side. Harry hadstopped trying to call deliberately on his dark side after the day he’d killedthe troll. But his dark side had never been something separate from him.It had been something remembered from Tom Riddle. Harry didn’t knowhow that had happened, but taking the assumption and running with it,whatever echoes of cognitive skill were in his dark side should be therefor him to use. Not as a separate mode, as Harry had conceptualized atfirst, but just as neural patterns with a strong tendency to chain into oneanother since they had once formed part of a connected whole.This unfortunately did not change that Professor Quirrell had thesame skills with far more life experience backing them up, and also hadthe gun.Harry turned, and set foot on the giant plant, and began to walk downthe spiral staircase provided by the leaves. It had taken Harry too longthis time, but he’d recovered himself to some degree, despite the griefstill weighing him down like thick water. It wasn’t a cold steel rod in hisspine, but it was something straight and solid nonetheless. He was going to play this through, see Hermione returned to life first, and then,somehow, stop Professor Quirrell. Or stop Professor Quirrell first andthen get the Stone himself. There had to be something, some possibility,some opportunity that would present itself, some way to stop Voldemortand return Hermione to life…Harry continued his descent.Behind him, the three-headed dog waited, guarding the gate.he spiraling leaves of the gigantic dieffenbachia felt like forest loambeneath Harry’s shoes, not as unyielding as concrete, but supporting his weight. Harry kept a wary eye on the tendrils, but they remainedpassive.When Harry reached the bottom of the leafy spiral staircase, the tendrils suddenly whipped out and grasped Harry’s arms and legs.After a brief struggle, Harry allowed himself to go limp.“Interesting,” said Professor Quirrell, as he floated down from above,not touching any of the plant’s leaves or tendrils. “I notice that you seemto have no trouble losing to a plant.”Harry looked more closely at the Defense Professor, seeing him nowwithout the lens of panic. Professor Quirrell was upright and moving, flying without apparent difficulty; the sense of doom about him was strong.But his eyes were still sunken in the skull, his arms thin and wasted. Thesickness had not been bluff, and the obvious hypothesis was that the Defense Professor had recently eaten another unicorn to temporarily regainsome strength.And the Defense Professor was also speaking like the mask of Professor Quirrell, not like Lord Voldemort, which might not be a bad thingfrom Harry’s perspective. Harry didn’t know why—unless it was thatthe Defense Professor still needed him for something—but it certainlyseemed to be in Harry’s own interests to play along.“You specifically let me walk into this trap, Professor,” Harry answered, just the way he’d have spoken to Professor Quirrell. Roles, masks,remind him of how it was between us… “On my own, I’d have used mybroomstick.”“Perhaps. How would an ordinary first-year solve this challenge? Ifthey had their wand, that is.” The plant was now reaching tendrils outtoward Professor Quirrell, but Professor Quirrell was hovering just outof their reach.Harry had now remembered Professor Sprout talking about a Devil’sSnare plant, which the Herbology textbook had said liked cool, darkplaces like caves—though how that could be true of a leafy plant wasanyone’s guess. “At a guess, I’d say this is a Devil’s Snare plant and itmight retreat from light or heat. So maybe a first-year could use Lumos?Today I’d use Inflammare, but I didn’t learn that spell until May.”A twirl of the Defense Professor’s wand, and a pattern of sprays ofliquid shot out from it, striking the plant near the bases of its tendrils,hitting with a quiet splat and then a quiet hissing. All the tendrils touching Harry frantically shot back and began to beat at the growing woundsappearing on the plant’s skin, as if trying to remove the pain-stimulus;something about the plant gave the impression that it was screamingsoundlessly.Professor Quirrell finished drifting downward. “Now it is afraid oflight, heat, acid, and me.”Harry stepped off the final leaves onto the floor, after a careful glanceat his robes and then the floor to make sure that none of the acid hadsplashed anywhere. Harry had begun to suspect that Professor Quirrellwas trying to make some sort of point, but Harry did not know what thatpoint might be. “I thought we were on a mission, Professor. I can’t stopyou, but is it smart to spend this much time on messing with me?”“Oh, we have time,” said Professor Quirrell, sounding amused. “Therewould be a great uproar if we were discovered here, guarded by an Inferius. You did not act like you had heard of such an uproar at your Quidditch match, before you arrived in this time and spoke to Snape as youdid.”A slight chill came over Harry, as he comprehended this. Anythinghe did to beat Professor Quirrell would have to not disrupt the school, orat least the Quidditch game, because it hadn’t disrupted the Quidditchgame. Even if enough forces could be called in to subdue Lord Voldemort,it might not be easy to do it without Professor McGonagall or Professor1710 *Flitwick or anyone else at the Quidditch game noticing…Fighting a smart enemy was hard.And even so… even so it seemed to Harry that if he stood in ProfessorQuirrell’s shoes, he would notbe having leisurely conversations and playing mind games. Professor Quirrell was gaining something by taking histime here. But what? Was there some other process that had to run tocompletion?“By the by, have you betrayed me yet?” said Professor Quirrell.“Have not betrayed you yet,” Harry hissed.The Defense Professor gestured pointedly with the gun he was nowholding in his left hand, and Harry walked ahead to the great woodendoor at the end of the room, and opened it.The next chamber was smaller in diameter, with a higher ceiling. Thelight shining out of the arched alcoves was white, instead of blue.Around them whizzed hundreds of winged keys, beating franticallythrough the air. After watching for a few seconds, it became clear thatonly a single key was the golden color of a Snitch—though it was movingslower than a Snitch in a real Quidditch game.On the other end of the room was a door containing a large, prominent keyhole.Against the left wall leaned a broomstick, the school’s workhorseCleansweep Seven.“Professor,” Harry said, staring up at the clouds and flocks ofwhizzing keys, “you said you would answer my questions. What exactly is all this about? If you think you’ve secured a door so that it won’topen without a key, you keep the key in a safe place and only give acopy to authorized entrants. You don’t give the key wings and then leave abroomstick propped against the wall. So what the heck are we doing in hereand what is going on? It’s an obvious guess that the magic mirror is theonly real factor guarding the Stone, but why the rest of this—and whyencourage first-years to come here?”“I am truly not sure,” said the Defense Professor. He had entered theroom and taken up station well to Harry’s right, maintaining the distancebetween them. “But I shall answer, as I said I would. Dumbledore’s wayis to do a dozen things which seem mad, and then only eight of them, orperhaps nine, conceal an inner meaning. My guess is that Dumbledoreintends to make it seem like I am invited to send a student as my proxy.Precisely so that Lord Voldemort, as Dumbledore conceives of him, is lesstempted to think himself clever by doing so. Imagine Dumbledore firstconsidering the issue of how to ward the Stone. Imagine Dumbledoreconsidering whether to set true dangers to guard the Mirror. Imaginehim imagining some young student blundering through those dangers atmy behest. I think that is what Dumbledore is trying to avoid, by makingit seem as though that strategy is invited, and so not cunning. Unless, ofcourse, I have misunderstood what Dumbledore thinks Lord Voldemortwill think.” Professor Quirrell grinned, and it looked just as natural, onhim, as any grin he’d shown Harry before. “Plotting does not come naturally to Dumbledore, but he tries because he must. To that task Dumbledore brings intelligence, dedication, the ability to learn from his mistakes, and an utter lack of native talent. He is marvelously hard to predictfor that reason alone.”Harry turned away, looking at the door on the opposite side of theroom. It wasn’t a game to him, Professor. “My guess is that the intendedsolution for first-years is to ignore the broomstick and use WingardiumLeviosa to grab the key, since this isn’t a Quidditch game and there are norules forbidding that. So what absurdly overpowered spell are you goingto unleash on this one, then?”There was a brief silence but for the whizzing of keys.Harry took several steps away from Professor Quirrell. “I probablyshouldn’t have said that, should I.”“Oh, no,” Professor Quirrell said. “I think that is a quite reasonablething to say to the most powerful Dark Wizard in the world when he isstanding not a dozen paces from you.”Professor Quirrell put his wand back into the sleeve of his other hand,the hand that sometimes held the gun.Then the Defense Professor reached into his mouth and took out what1712 *appeared to be a tooth. He tossed the false tooth high in the air, and whenit came down, it had transformed into a wand that sparked a strangesense of recognition in Harry’s mind, as though some part of him recognized that wand as being… part of him…Thirteen and a half inches, yew, with a core of phoenix feather. Harry hadmemorized the information when the wandmaker Olli-something hadgiven it, because it had seemed like it might be Plot-Relevant. The event,and the thinking that had underlain it, both felt a lifetime distant.The Defense Professor raised that wand, and traced in the air a flaming rune that was all jagged edges and malevolence; Harry took anotherinstinctive step back. Then Professor Quirrell spoke. “Az-reth. Az-reth.Az-reth.”The flaming rune began pouring out fire that was… twisted, as thoughthe jagged edges of the rune had become the nature of the fire itself. Thefire was blazing crimson, shaded further red than blood, glowing as searingly intense as an arc-welder. That brilliance in that shade seemed wrongin its own right, like nothing shaded so far red should give off that muchlight; and the searing crimson was shot through with veins of black thatseemed to suck the light from the fire. Within the blackened fire, outlined in the interplay of crimson and darkness, animal shapes twistedwildly from one predator to another, cobra to hyena to scorpion.“Az-reth. Az-reth. Az-reth.” When Professor Quirrell had repeatedthe word six times, as much black-crimson fire had poured out as the volume of a small bush.The cursed fire slowed in its changes as Professor Quirrell locked eyesupon it, taking on a single form, the form of a blackened blood-burningphoenix.And something told Harry with a terrible certainty that if that blackburning phoenix met Fawkes, the true phoenix would die and never bereborn.Professor Quirrell made a single gesture with his wand, and the blackened fire went soaring across the room. It met the door and its keyhole,and with a single sweep of crimson-burning wings, most of the door andpart of the archway was consumed. Then the tainted crimson blaze swepton.1713 *Harry had only a glance through the hole to see huge statues just beginning to raise swords and clubs, when the blackened fire came amongthem, and they cracked and burned.When it ended, the blackened-fire phoenix swept back in throughthe hole, and hovered above Professor Quirrell’s left shoulder, the sunintense crimson claws staying an inch from his robes.“Go on ahead,” said Professor Quirrell. “It’s safe now.”Harry walked forward, needing to invoke his dark side’s cognitivepatterns in order to maintain calm enough to do it. Harry stepped overthe glowing edges of the remaining part of the door, and gazed at achessboard of ruined huge chess-pieces. The alternating tiles of blackand white marble on the floor started five meters after the ruined doorway, and extended from wall to wall, but stopped five meters short of thenext door on the opposite side of the room. The ceiling was significantlyhigher than any of the statues should have been able to reach.“I would guess,” Harry said, and his dark side’s cognitive patternskept his voice calm, “that the intended solution is to fly over the statuesusing the broomstick from the previous room, since it wasn’t actuallyneeded to get the key?”From behind, Professor Quirrell laughed, and it was Lord Voldemort’slaugh. “Proceed,” said a voice grown colder and higher. “Go to the nextroom. I wish to see what you will make of what is there.”Arranged by Dumbledore for first-years, Harry reminded himself, it WILLbe safe, and he walked across the ruined chessboard, laid his hand uponthat door’s handle, and pushed it inward.Half a second later, Harry slammed the door and leapt back.It took Harry several seconds to master his breathing, and masterhimself. From behind the door came continued loud bellows, and greatslams as of a rock club pounding the floor.“I suppose,” Harry said in a voice grown cold as well, “that since Dumbledore would hardly put a real mountain troll in there, the next challenge1714 *is an illusion of my worst memories. Like a Dementor, with the memoryprojected into the outside world. Very amusing, Professor.”Professor Quirrell advanced himself toward the door, and Harrystepped well aside. Besides the sense of doom that was now strongabout the Professor, Harry’s dark side or just plain instinct was advisinghim not to get anywhere near that black-crimson fire hovering aboveProfessor Quirrell’s shoulder.Professor Quirrell swung open the door, and looked in. “Hm,” Professor Quirrell said. “Just the troll, as you say. Ah, well. I had hoped to learnsomething about you more interesting than that. What lies within is aKokorhekkus, also known as the common boggart.”“A boggart? What does that—no, I suppose I know what it does.”“A boggart,” Professor Quirrell said, and now his voice was again thatof a Hogwarts Professor lecturing, “gravitates to dark enclosures that arerarely opened, such as a neglected cupboard in the attic. It seeks to beleft alone, and it will manifest in whatever form it thinks will scare youaway.”“Scare me away?” Harry said. “I killed the troll.”“You leapt backward out of the room without thinking. A boggartseeks out the instinctive flinch, not the reasoned threat. Else it wouldhave selected something more believable. In any case, the standardcounter-Charm for a boggart is, of course, Fiendfyre.” Professor Quirrell gestured, and the blackened fire leapt off his shoulder and pouredthrough the doorway.From within the room there was a single squeak, and then nothing.They advanced into the boggart’s former room, Professor Quirrell going first this time. With the seeming mountain troll gone, the room wasjust another huge chamber lit by sconces of cold blue light.Professor Quirrell’s gaze seemed distant, thoughtful. He crossed theroom without waiting for Harry, and swung open the door on the opposite wall of his own accord.Harry followed after, and not closely.1715 *The next chamber contained a cauldron, a rack of bottled ingredients,chopping boards, stirring sticks, and the other apparatus of Potions. Thelight coming from the arched alcoves was white instead of blue, presumably because color vision was important to Potions-brewing. ProfessorQuirrell was already standing next to the brewing apparatus, scrutinizing a long parchment he had picked up. The door to the next chamberwas guarded by a curtain of purple fire that would have looked a lot morethreatening, if it hadn’t seemed pale and weak by comparison to the blackened flame hovering over Professor Quirrell’s shoulder.Harry’s suspension of disbelief had already checked out on vacationat this point, so he didn’t say anything about how real-world security systems had the goal of distinguishing authorized from unauthorized personnel, which meant issuing challenges that behaved differently around people who were or weren’t supposed to be there. For example, a good securitychallenge would be testing whether the entrant knew a lock combinationthat only authorized people had been told, and a bad security challengewould be testing whether the entrant could brew a potion according towritten instructions that had been helpfully included.Professor Quirrell tossed the parchment toward Harry, and it fluttured to the ground between them. “What do you make of this?” saidProfessor Quirrell, who then stepped back so that Harry could come forward and pick up the parchment.“Nope,” Harry said after skimming the parchment. “Testing whetherthe entrant can solve a ridiculously straightforward logic puzzle aboutthe order of the ingredients is still not a challenge that behaves differentlyfor authorized and unauthorized personnel. It doesn’t matter if you use amore interesting logic puzzle about three idols or a line of people wearingcolored hats, you’re still completely missing the point.”“Look at the other side,” said Professor Quirrell.Harry turned over the two-foot parchment.On the other side, written in tiny letters, was the longest list of brewinginstructions Harry had ever seen. “What on Earth—”“A potion of effulgence, to quench the purple fire,” Professor Quirrellsaid. “It is made by adding the same ingredients, over and over again, inslightly different ways. Imagine some eager young group of first-years,1716 *passing all the other chambers, thinking they are just about to reach themagic mirror, and then encountering this task. This room is the handiwork of the Potions Master indeed.”Harry glanced pointedly at the blackfire shape on Professor Quirrell’sshoulder. “Fire can’t beat fire?”“It can,” said Professor Quirrell. “I am not sure it should. Supposethis room is trapped?”Harry did not want to be stuck brewing this potion for laughs, or forwhatever other reason Professor Quirrell was taking them through thesechambers so slowly. The potions recipe had thirty-five separate occasionsfor adding bellflowers, fourteen times to add ‘a lock of bright hair’…“Maybe the potion gives off a lethal gas that is fatal to adult wizards butnot children. Or any of a hundred other deadly tricks, if we’re suddenlybeing serious. Are we being serious?”“This room is the handiwork of Severus Snape,” Professor Quirrellsaid, once more looking thoughtful. “Snape is not a bystander in thisgame, not quite. He lacks Dumbledore’s intelligence, but possesses thekilling intent that Dumbledore never had.”“Well, whatever’s going on here, it doesn’t actually keep out children,”Harry observed. “Lots of first-years made it through. And if you can somehow keep out everyone except children, then that, from Dumbledore’s perspective, forces Lord Voldemort to possess a child to enter. I don’t see thepoint, given their goals.”“Indeed,” Professor Quirrell said, rubbing the bridge of his nose. “Butsee, boy, this room lacks the triggers and tripsigns that are upon the others. There are no subtle wards to be defeated. It is as if I am invited tobypass the Potion and simply enter—but Snape knows that Lord Voldemort will perceive this. If in fact there was a trap laid for anyone who didnot brew the potion, then it would be wiser to lay wards, and give no signthat this room was different from the others.”Harry listened, frowning in concentration. “So… the only point ofleaving off the detection webs is to make you not bulldoze this room.”“I expect Snape expects me to deduce that as well,” the Defense Professor said. “And past that point I cannot predict at what level he thinks Iwill play. I am patient, and I have given myself plenty of time for this en*1717 *deavor. But Snape does not know me, he only knows Lord Voldemort. Hehas sometimes seen Lord Voldemort shriek in frustration, and act on impulses that appear counterproductive. Consider this matter from Snape’sperspective: it is the Potions Master of Hogwarts telling Lord Voldemortto be patient and follow instructions if he wants to enter, as though LordVoldemort were a mere schoolboy. I would find it easy to comply, smiling the while, and take my vengeance later. But Snape does not knowthat Lord Voldemort finds it easy to think this way.” Professor Quirrelllooked at Harry. “Boy, you saw me floating in the air by the Devil’s Snare,did you not?”Harry nodded. Then he noticed his confusion. “My Charms textbooksays that it’s impossible for wizards to levitate themselves.”“Yes,” said Professor Quirrell, “that is what it says in your Charms textbook. No wizard may levitate themselves, or any object supporting theirown weight; it is like trying to lift yourself up by your own bootstraps. YetLord Voldemort alone can fly—how? Answer as quickly as you can.”If the question was answerable by a first-year student— “You hadsomeone else cast broomstick enchantments on your underwear, thenyou Obliviated them.”“Not quite,” said Professor Quirrell. “The broomstick enchantmentsrequire a long narrow shape, which must be solid. Cloth will not do.”Harry’s eyebrows furrowed. “How long does the shape have to be?Can you attach some short broomstick rods to a fabric harness, and flyusing those?”“Indeed, at first I strapped enchanted rods to my arms and legs, butthat was only to teach myself a new mode of flight.” Professor Quirrelldrew back the sleeve of his robes, revealing the bare arm. “As you can see,I have nothing up my sleeve right now.”Harry absorbed this further constraint. “You had someone castbroomstick enchantments on your bones?”Professor Quirrell sighed. “And that was one of Voldemort’s mostfeared feats, or so I am told. After all these years, and some amount ofreluctant Legilimency, I still do not truly comprehend what is wrong withordinary people… But you are not one of them. It is time for you to begin1718 *contributing to this expedition. You have known Severus Snape more recently than I. Tell me your own analysis of this room.”Harry hesitated, trying to look thoughtful.“I will mention,” said Professor Quirrell, as the blackened-firephoenix on his shoulder seemed to extend its head and glare at Harry,“that if you knowingly allow me to fail, I will call it betrayal. I remindyou that the Stone is key to Miss Granger’s resurrection, and that I holdhostage the lives of hundreds of students.”“I remember,” Harry said, and on the heels of this Harry’s wonderfulinventive brain came up with a thought.Harry wasn’t sure if he should say it.The silence stretched.“Have you thought of anything yet?” said Professor Quirrell. “Answerin Parseltongue.”No, this was not going to be easy, not against a smart opponent whocould force you to tell the literal truth at any time. “Severus, at leastthe modern-day Severus, respects your intelligence a great deal,” Harrysaid instead. “I think… I think he might expect Voldemort to believe thatSeverus wouldn’t believe that Voldemort could pass his test of patience,but Severus would expect Voldemort to pass it.”Professor Quirrell nodded. “That is a plausible theory. Do you believeit yourself? Answer in Parseltongue.”“Yess,” Harry hissed. It might not be safe to withhold information, noteven thoughts and ideas… “Therefore, the point of this room is to delayLord Voldemort for an hour. And if I wanted to kill you, believing whatDumbledore believes, the obvious thing to try would be a Dementor’s Kiss.I mean, they think you’re a disembodied soul—are you, by the way?”Professor Quirrell was still. “Dumbledore would not think of thatmethod,” the Defense Professor said after a time. “But Severus might.”Professor Quirrell began to tap a finger against his cheek, his gaze distant. “You have power over Dementors, boy, can you tell me if there areany nearby?”Harry closed his eyes. If there were voids in the world, he could notfeel them. “None that I can sense.”“Answer in Parseltongue.”1719 *“Do not ssensse life-eaterss.”“But you were being honest with me when you suggested the possibility? You intended no clever trickery?”“Wass honesst. Not trick.”“Perhaps there is some means by which Dementors might be concealed, being told to leap out and eat a possessing soul if they see one…”Professor Quirrell was still tapping his cheek. “It is not impossible thatI would qualify. Or it can be told to eat anyone who passes throughthis room too quickly, or anyone who is not a child. Bearing in mindthat I hold Hermione and hundreds of other students hostage over you,would you use your power over Dementors to defend me, if a Dementorunmasked itself? Answer in Parseltongue.”“Don't know,” Harry hissed.“Life-eaterss cannot desstroy me, I think,” hissed Professor Quirrell. “And Iwill ssimply abandon thiss body if they approach too closse. Sshall return sswiftly thisstime, and then there will be no sstopping me. Will torture your parentss for yearss, topunissh you for balking me. Hundredss of hosstage sstudentss die, including thosseyou call friendss. Now I assk again. Will you usse power over life-eaterss to protectme, if life-eaterss come?”“Yess,” Harry whispered. The sadness and horror that Harry hadpushed down flared up again, and his dark side had no stored patternsfor handling the emotions. Why, Professor Quirrell, why are you like this…Professor Quirrell smiled. “That reminds me. Have you betrayed meyet?”“Have not betrayed you yet.”Professor Quirrell went over to the Potions equipment, and beganchopping a root one-handed, the knife moving almost invisibly fast andwith no apparent effort. The Fiendfyre phoenix drifted over to the opposite corner of the room and waited there. “All matters considered in theiruncertainty, it seems wiser to expend the time to pass this room as a firstyear would,” said the Defense Professor. “We may as well talk while weare waiting. You had questions, boy? I said that I would answer them, soask.”he Defense Professor had set up a cauldron, floating it into placewith a wave of his wand, another wave starting a fire beneath it. Abrief circling of the Defense Professor’s finger had set in motion a longhandled spoon, and it had continued stirring the cauldron without beingheld. Now the Defense Professor was measuring out a heap of flowersfrom a large jar, what Harry supposed to be bellflowers; the indigo petalsseemed luminous in the white light of the walls, and curved inward in away that gave the impression of a desire for privacy. The first of theseflowers had been added to the potion at once, but then the cauldron hadjust gone on stirring itself for a while.The Defense Professor had assumed a position from which he couldsee Harry just by turning his head slightly, and Harry knew that he waswithin the Defense Professor’s peripheral vision.In the corner a Fiendfyre phoenix waited, some of the nearby stonebeginning to gloss over as it melted to greater smoothness. The burningwings shed crimson light that gave everything in the room a tint of blood,and reflected in scarlet sparks from the glassware.“Time is wasting,” said Professor Quirrell. “Ask your questions, if youhave them.”Why, Professor Quirrell, why, why must you be this way, why make yourselfthe monster, why Lord Voldemort, I know you might not want the same things Ido, but I can’t imagine what you want that makes this the best way to get it…That was what Harry’s brain wanted to know.1721 *What Harry needed to know was… some way out of what was going tohappen next. But the Defense Professor had said that he wouldn’t talkabout his future plans. It was strange enough that the Defense Professorwas willing to talk about anything, that had to contradict one of his Rules…“I’m thinking,” Harry said aloud.Professor Quirrell smiled slightly. He was using a pestle to grind thepotion’s first magical ingredient, a glowing red hexagon. “I quite understand,” said the Defense Professor. “But do not think over-long, child.”Goals: Prevent Lord Voldemort from harming people, find a way to kill orneutralise him, but first get the Stone and resurrect Hermione……convince Professor Quirrell to STOP THIS…Harry swallowed, pushing down the emotion, trying not to let the water reach his eyes. Tears probably wouldn’t make a good impression onLord Voldemort. Professor Quirrell was already frowning, though fromthe direction of his gaze he was examining a leaf colored in vivid shadesof white, green, and purple.There wasn’t any obvious way to reach any of the goals, not yet. AllHarry could do was ask the questions that seemed most likely to provideuseful information, even if Harry didn’t yet have a plan.So we just ask about whatever seems most interesting? said Harry’s Ravenclaw side. I’m up for that.Shut up, Harry told the voice; and then, on further reflection, decidedthat he was no longer pretending it was there.Four topics came to Harry’s mind as being priorities from the standpoint of curiosity about important things. Four questions, then, four major subjects, to try to fit in while this potion was still being brewed.Four questions…“I ask my first question,” Harry said. “What really happened on thenight of October 31st, 1981?” Why was that night different from all othernights… “I would like the entire story, please.”The question of how and why Lord Voldemort had survived his apparent death seemed likely to matter for future planning.“I expected you would ask that,” Professor Quirrell said, dropping abellflower and a white glittering stone into the potion. “To begin, every* 1722 *thing I told you about the horcrux spell is true; as you should realise, sinceI spoke in Parseltongue.”Harry nodded.“Within seconds after you learned the details of the spell, you perceived the central flaw, and began pondering how the spell might be improved. Do you think the young Tom Riddle was any different?”Harry shook his head.“Well, he was,” said Professor Quirrell. “Whenever I was tempted todespair of you, I reminded myself how I was an idiot at twice your age.When I was fifteen I made myself a horcrux as a certain book had shownme, using the death of Abigail Myrtle beneath the eyes of Slytherin’sbasilisk. I planned to make a new horcrux every year after I left Hogwarts, and call that my fallback plan if my other hopes of immortality didnot come to fruition. In retrospect, the young Tom Riddle was graspingstraws. The thought of making a better horcrux, of not being contentwith the spell I had already learned… this thought did not come to meuntil I had grasped the stupidity of ordinary people, and realised whichfollies of theirs I had imitated. But in time I learned the habit that youinherited from me, to ask in every instance how it might be done better.To be content with the spell I had learned from a book, when it bore onlya faint resemblance to what I truly wanted? Absurd! And so I set forth tocreate a better spell.”“You have true immortality, now?” Harry was aware that, even witheverything else going on, this was a question more important than warand strategy.“Indeed,” said Professor Quirrell. He paused in his Potions work andturned to face Harry fully; there was a look of exultation in the man’s eyesthat Harry had never seen there before. “In all the Darkest Arts I couldfind, in all the interdicted secrets to which Slytherin’s Monster gave mekeys, in all the lore remembered among wizardkind, I found only hintsand smatterings of what I needed. So I rewove it and remade it, and devised a new ritual based on new principles. I kept that ritual burning inmy mind for years, perfecting it in imagination, pondering its meaningand making fine adjustments, waiting for the intention to stabilise. Atlast I dared to invoke my ritual, an invented sacrificial ritual, based on aprinciple untested by all known magic. And I lived, and yet live.” The Defense Professor spoke with quiet triumph, as though the act itself was sogreat that no words could ever do it justice. “I still use the word ‘horcrux’,but only from sentiment. It is a new thing entirely, the greatest of all mycreations.”“As one of my questions you said you’d answer, I ask how to cast thatspell,” Harry said.“Denied.” The Defense Professor turned back to his potion, droppingin a gray-flecked white feather and a bellflower. “I had thought perhapsto teach you when you were older, for no Tom Riddle would be contentotherwise; but I have changed my mind.”Memory is a hard thing to recall, sometimes, and Harry had been trying to remember if Professor Quirrell had dropped any hints about thissubject before. Something about Professor Quirrell’s phrasing sparked amemory: Perhaps you will be told when you are older…“There are still physical anchors for your immortality,” Harry saidaloud. “It resembles the old horcrux spell by that much, which is anotherreason you still call them horcruxes.” It was dangerous to say aloud,but Harry needed to know. “If I’m wrong, you can always deny it inParseltongue.”Professor Quirrell was smiling evilly. “Your guesss iss right, boy, for all thegood it doess you.”Unfortunately, that wasn’t a difficult vulnerability to cover if the Enemy was smart. Harry wouldn’t ordinarily have made the suggestion, justin case the Enemy hadn’t thought of it for themselves, but in this case he’dalready made it. “One horcux dropped into an active volcano, weightedso it would sink into the Earth’s mantle,” Harry said heavily. “The sameplace I thought of dropping the Dementor if I couldn’t destroy it. Andthen you asked me where else I would hide something if I didn’t wantanyone to find it ever again. One horcrux buried kilometers down, in ananonymous cubic meter of the Earth’s crust. One horcrux you droppedinto the Mariana Trench. One horcrux floating high in the stratosphere,transparent. Even you don’t know where they are, because you Obliviatedthe exact details from your memory. And the last horcrux is the Pioneer11 plaque that you snuck into NASA and modified. It’s where you get yourimage of the stars, when you cast the spell of starlight. Fire, earth, water,air, void.” Something of a riddle, the Defense Professor had called it, andtherefore Harry had remembered it. Something of a Riddle.“Indeed,” said the Defense Professor. “It did give me something of ashock when you remembered it that quickly, but I suppose it makes nodifference; all five are beyond my reach, or yours.”That might not be true, especially if there was some way to trace themagical connection somehow and determine the location… though presumably Voldemort would have done his best to obscure it… but whatmagic had done, magic might be able to defeat. Pioneer 11 might be faraway by wizard standards, but NASA knew exactly where it was, and itwas probably a lot more reachable if you could use magic to tell the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation to bugger off…A sudden note of worry plucked at Harry’s mind. There was no rulesaying the Defense Professor needed to have told the truth about whichinterstellar probe he’d horcruxed, and if Harry recalled correctly, communication and tracking of the Pioneer 10 probe had been lost shortly afterthe Jupiter fly-by.Why wouldn’t Professor Quirrell have just horcruxed them both?The obvious next thought came to Harry. It was something that oughtnot to be suggested, if the Enemy had not thought of it. But it seemedextremely probable that the Enemy had thought of it.“Tell me, teacher,” Harry hissed, “would desstroying thosse ﬁve anchors sslayyou?”“Why do you assk?” hissed the Defense Professor, with a lilt to the hissthat Parseltongue translated as snakish amusement. “Do you ssusspect thatansswer is no?”Harry couldn’t think of how to answer, though he strongly suspectedthat it didn’t matter in any case.“Your ssusspicion iss right, boy. Desstroying thosse ﬁve would not render me mortal.”Harry’s throat felt a bit dry again. If the spell had no disastrous costassociated with it… “How many anchorss did you make?”“Would not ordinarily ssay, but iss clear you have already guesssed.” The Defense Professor’s smile widened. “Ansswer iss that I do not know. Sstoppedcountingssomewherearoundonehundredandsseven. Ssimplymadeahabitofiteachtime I murdered ssomeone in private.”Over one hundred murders, in private, before Lord Voldemort hadstopped counting. And even worse news—“Your immortality spell stillrequires a human death? Why?”“Great creation maintainss life and magic within devicess created by ssacriﬁcinglife and magic of otherss.” Again that hissing snake laughter. “Liked falsse desscription of previousss horcrux sspell sso much, sso dissappointed when realissed truthof it, thoughtss of improved verssion came out in that sshape.”Harry wasn’t sure why the Defense Professor was giving him all thisvital information, but there had to be a reason, and that was making him nervous. “So you really are a disembodied spirit possessing Quirinus Quirrell.”“Yess. I sshall return sswiftly, if thiss body iss killed. Will be greatly annoyed, andvengeful. I am telling you this, boy, so that you do not try anything stupid.”“I understand,” Harry said. He did his best to organize his thoughts,remember what he’d meant to ask next, while the Defense Professorturned his eyes back to the potion. The man’s left hand was dribblingcrushed seashell into the cauldron, while his right hand dropped inanother bellflower. “So what did happen on October 31st? You… tried toturn the baby Harry Potter into a horcrux, either the new kind or the oldkind. You did it deliberately, because you told Lily Potter,” Harry tooka breath. Now that he knew why the chills were there, he could endurethem. “Very well, I accept the bargain. Yourself to die, and the childto live. Now drop your wand so that I can murder you.” In retrospect,it was clear that Harry had remembered that event mainly from LordVoldemort’s perspective, and only at the very end had he seen it throughthe baby Harry Potter’s eyes. “What did you do? Why did you do it?”“Trelawney’s prophecy,” Professor Quirrell said. His hand tapped abellflower with a strip of copper before dropping it in. “I spent long dayspondering it, after Snape brought the prophecy to me. Prophecies arenever trivial things. And how shall I put this in a way that does not makeyou think stupid things… well, I shall say it, and if you are stupid I shallbe annoyed. I was fascinated by the prophecy’s assertion that someonewould be my equal, because it might mean that person could hold up theother end of an intelligent conversation. After fifty years of being surrounded by gibbering stupidity, I no longer cared whether my reactionmight be considered a literary cliche. I was not about to pass up on thatopportunity without thinking about it first. And then, you see, I had aclever idea.” Professor Quirrell sighed. “It occurred to me how I mightfulfill the Prophecy my own way, to my own benefit. I would mark thebaby as my equal by casting the old horcrux spell in such fashion as toimprint my own spirit onto the baby’s blank slate; it would be a purercopy of myself, since there would be no old self to mix with the new. Insome years, when I had become bored with ruling Britain and moved onto other things, I would arrange with the other Tom Riddle that he shouldappear to vanquish me, and he would rule over the Britain he had saved.We would play the game against each other forever, keeping our lives interesting amid a world of fools. I knew a dramatist would predict thatthe two of us would end by destroying each other; but I pondered longupon it, and decided that both of us would simply decline to play out thedrama. That was my decision and I was confident that it would remainso; both Tom Riddles, I thought, would be too intelligent to truly go downthat road. The prophecy seemed to hint that if I destroyed all but a remnant of Harry Potter, then our spirits would not be so different, and wecould exist in the same world.”“Something went wrong,” Harry said. “Something that blew off thetop of the Potters’ home in Godric’s Hollow, gave me the scar on my forehead, and left your burnt body behind.”Professor Quirrell nodded. His hands had slowed in their Potionswork. “The resonance in our magic,” Professor Quirrell said quietly.“When I had shaped the baby’s spirit to be like my own…”Harry remembered the moment in Azkaban when Professor Quirrell’s Killing Curse had collided with his Patronus. The burning, tearingagony in his forehead, like his head had been about to split in half.“I cannot count how many times I have thought of that night, rehearsing my mistake, thinking of wiser things I should have done,” said Professor Quirrell. “I later decided that I should have thrown my wand from myhand and changed into my Animagus form. But that night… that night,I instinctively tried to control the chaotic fluctuations in my magic, evenas I felt myself burning up from inside. That was the wrong decision, andI failed. So my body was destroyed, even as I overwrote the infant HarryPotter’s mind; either of us destroying all but a remnant of the other. Andthen…” Professor Quirrell’s expression was controlled. “And then, when Iregained consciousness inside my horcruxes, it turned out that my greatcreation did not work as I had hoped. I should have been able to float freeof my horcruxes and possess any victim that consented to me, or that wastoo weak to refuse me. That was the part of my great creation that failedmy intent. As with the original horcrux spell, I would only be able to entera victim who contacted the physical horcrux… and I had hidden my unnumbered horcruxes in places where nobody would ever find them. Yourinstinct is correct, boy, this would not be a good time to laugh.”Harry stayed very quiet.The Potions-making had come to a temporary pause, a space whereno ingredients were added while the cauldron simmered for a time. “Ispent most of my time looking at the stars,” Professor Quirrell said, hisvoice quieter now. The Defense Professor had turned from the potion,staring at the white-illuminated walls of the room. “My remaining hopewas the horcruxes I had hidden in the hopeless idiocy of my youth. Imbuing them into ancient lockets, instead of anonymous pebbles; guardingthem beneath wells of poison in the center of a lake of Inferi, instead ofportkeying them into the sea. If someone found one of those, and penetrated their ridiculous protections… but that seemed like a distant hope.I was not sure I would ever be embodied again. Yet at least I was immortal. The worst of all fates had been averted, my great creation had donethat much. I had little left to hope for, and little left to fear. I decided thatI would not go insane, since there seemed to be no advantage in it. Instead, I gazed out at the stars and thought, as the Sun slowly diminishedbehind me. I reflected on the errors of my past life; they were many, inthat hindsight. In my imagination I constructed powerful new rituals Imight attempt, if I was free to use my magic once more, and yet confident of my immortality. I contemplated ancient riddles at greater lengththan before, for all that I had once thought myself patient. I knew that ifI won free, I would be more powerful by far than in my previous life; butI mostly did not expect that to happen.” Professor Quirrell turned backto the potion. “Nine years and four months after that night, a wanderingadventurer named Quirinus Quirrell won past the protections guardingone of my earliest horcruxes. The rest you know. And now, boy, you maysay what we both know you are thinking.”“Um,” Harry said. “It doesn’t seem like a very smart thing to say—”“Indeed, Mr. Potter. It is not a clever thing to say to me. Not even alittle. Not in the slightest. But I know you’re thinking it, and you will go onthinking it and I will go on knowing that until you say it. So speak.”“So. Um. I realise that this is something that is more obvious in hindsight than in foresight, and I’m certainly not suggesting that you try tocorrect the error now, but if you are a Dark Lord and you happen to hearabout a child who has been prophesied to defeat you, there is a certainspell which is unblockable, unstoppable, and works every single time onanything with a brain—”“Yes thank you Mr. Potter that thought occurred to me several times over thenext nine years.” Professor Quirrell picked up another bellflower and began crumbling it in his bare fist. “I made that principle the centerpieceof my Battle Magic curriculum after I learned its centrality the hard way.It was not the first Rule on the younger Tom Riddle’s list. It is only byharsh experience that we learn which principles take priority over whichother principles; as mere words they all sound equally persuasive. In retrospect it would have been better if I had sent Bellatrix to the Potters’home in my place; but I had a Rule telling me that for such matters Imust go myself and not try sending a trusted lieutenant. Yes, I considered the Killing Curse; but I wondered if casting the Killing Curse at aninfant would somehow cause the curse to bounce off and hit me, thusfulfilling the prophecy. How was I to know?”“So use an axe, it’s hard to get a prophecy-fulfilling spell backfire outof an axe,” Harry said and then shut up.“I decided the safest path was to try to fulfill the prophecy on my ownterms,” Professor Quirrell said. “Needless to say, the next time I hear aprophecy I do not like, I will tear it apart at every possible point of intervention,rather than trying to play along.” Professor Quirrell was crushing a roseas though to squeeze the juice out of it, still using his bare fist. “And noweveryone thinks the Boy-Who-Lived is somehow immune to the KillingCurse, even though Killing Curses do not ruin houses or leave burnt bodies behind them, because it has not occurred to them that Lord Voldemort wouldever use any other spell.”Harry again stayed quiet. It had occurred to Harry that there was another obvious way that Lord Voldemort could have avoided his mistake.Something that might perhaps be easier to see given a Muggle upbringing, instead of the wizarding way of looking at things.Harry had not yet decided whether to tell Professor Quirrell about histhought; there were both pros and cons to pointing out that particularerror.After a time Professor Quirrell picked up the next Potions ingredient,a strand of what looked like unicorn hair. “I tell you this as a caution,”said Professor Quirrell. “Do not expect me to be delayed another nineyears, if you somehow destroy this body of mine. I set horcruxes in betterplaces at once, and now even that is unnecessary. Thanks to you, I learnedwhere to find the Resurrection Stone. The Resurrection Stone does notbring back the dead, of course; but it holds a more ancient magic thanmy own for projecting the seeming of a spirit. And since I am one whohas defeated death, Cadmus’s Hallow acknowledged me its master, andanswered all my will. I have now incorporated it into my great creation.”Professor Quirrell smiled slightly. “I had many years earlier consideredmaking that device a horcrux, but decided against it at the time, sinceI realized that the ring had magic of unknown nature… ah, such ironiesdoes life play upon us. But I digress. You, boy, you brought that about,you freed my spirit to fly where it pleases and seduce the most opportunevictim, by being too casual with your secrets. It is a catastrophe for anywho oppose me, and you wrought it with one finger drawing wetness on atea-saucer. This world will be a safer place for all, if you learn the rectitudethat wizardborns absorb in childhood. And all thiss that I have jusst said iss thetruth.”Harry closed his eyes, and his own hand massaged his forehead; if hehad seen it from the outside, it would have looked the mirror of ProfessorQuirrell in deep thought.The problem of defeating Professor Quirrell was looking increasinglydifficult, even by the standards of the sort of impossible problems thatHarry had solved already. If communicating that difficulty was what Professor Quirrell was trying to do, he was succeeding. Harry was starting toseriously consider the possibility that it might be better to offer to ruleBritain as Voldemort’s nonhomicidal delegate, if Professor Quirrell himself would just agree to stop killing people all the time. Even mostly.But that wasn’t likely to happen.Harry stared at his hands, from where he had sat down upon the floor,feeling sadness shading over into despair. The Lord Voldemort who’dgiven Harry his dark side had spent that long thinking things over andreflecting on his own thought processes… and had emerged as the calm,clear-headed, and still homicidal Professor Quirrell.Professor Quirrell added a pinch of golden hair to the potion of effulgence, and that reminded Harry that time was continuing to move; thelocks of bright hair were rarer than the bellflowers.“I ask my second question,” Harry said. “Tell me about the Philosopher’s Stone. Does it do anything besides making Transfigurations permanent? Is it possible to make more Stones, and why is that problemhard?”Professor Quirrell was bent over the potion, and Harry could not seehis face. “Very well, I shall tell you the Stone’s story as I have inferred it.The one and only power of the Stone is the imposition of permanency,to render a temporary form into a true and lasting substance—a powerabsolutely beyond ordinary spells. Conjurations such as the castle Hogwarts are maintained by a constant well of magic. Even Metamorphmagicannot manifest golden fingernails and then trim them for sale. It istheorized that the Metamorphmagus curse merely rearranges the substance of their flesh, like a Muggle smith manipulates iron with hammerand tongs; and their body contains no gold. If Merlin himself could create gold from thin air, history does not record it. So the Stone, we canguess even before research, must be a very old thing indeed. In contrast,Nicholas Flamel has been known to the world for a mere six centuries.Tell me the obvious next question to ask, boy, if you wanted to trace theStone’s history.”“Um,” Harry said. He rubbed his forehead, concentrating. If theStone was old, but the world had only known Nicholas Flamel for six cen*1731 *turies… “Was there some other very long-lived wizard who disappearedat around the same time Nicholas Flamel showed up?”“Close,” said Professor Quirrell. “You recall that six centuries agothere was a Dark Lady called undying, the sorceress Baba Yaga? She wassaid to be able to heal any wound in herself, to change shape into anyform she pleased… she held the Stone of Permanency, obviously. Andthen one year Baba Yaga agreed to teach Battle Magic at Hogwarts, under an old and respected truce.” Professor Quirrell looked… angry, a looksuch as Harry had rarely seen on him. “But she was not trusted, and sothere was invoked a curse. Some curses are easier to cast when they bindyourself and others alike; Slytherin’s Parselmouth curse is an exampleof such. In this case, Baba Yaga’s signature, and signatures from everystudent and teacher of Hogwarts, were placed within an ancient deviceknown as the Goblet of Fire. Baba Yaga swore not to shed a drop ofstudents’ blood, nor take from the students anything that was theirs. Inreturn, the students swore not to shed a drop of Baba Yaga’s blood, nortake from her anything that was hers. So they all signed, with the Gobletof Fire to witness it and punish the transgressor.”Professor Quirrell picked up a new ingredient, a loose thread of goldwrapped around a pinch of foul-looking substance. “Entering her sixthyear at Hogwarts, then, was a witch named Perenelle. And althoughPerenelle was new-come into the beauty of her youth, her heart wasalready blacker than Baba Yaga’s own—”“You’re calling her evil?” Harry said, then realized he had just committed the fallacy of ad hominem tu quoque.“Hush, boy, I am telling the story. Where was I? Ah, yes, Perenelle,the beautiful and covetous. Perenelle seduced the Dark Lady over themonths, with gentle touches and flirtations and the shy pretense ofinnocence. The Dark Lady’s heart was captured, and they became lovers.And then one night Perenelle whispered how she had heard of BabaYaga’s shape-changing power and how this thought had enflamed herdesires; thus Perenelle swayed Baba Yaga to come to her with the Stonein hand, to assume many guises in a single night, for their pleasures.Among other forms Perenelle bid Baba Yaga take the form of a man; andthey lay together in the fashion of a man and a woman. But Perenellehad been a virgin until that night. And since they were all rather oldfashioned in those days, the Goblet of Fire accounted that as the shedding of Perenelle’s blood, and the taking of what was hers; thus BabaYaga was tricked into being forsworn, and the Goblet rendered her defenseless. Then Perenelle killed the unsuspecting Baba Yaga as she sleptin Perenelle’s bed, killed the Dark Lady who had loved her and comepeacefully to Hogwarts under truce; and that was the end of the pact bywhich Dark Wizards and Witches taught Battle Magic at Hogwarts. Forthe next few centuries the Goblet of Fire was used to oversee pointlessinter-school tournaments, and then it resided in a disused chamber atBeauxbatons, until I finally stole it.” Professor Quirrell dropped a palebeige-pink twig into the cauldron, and its color changed to white justas it touched the surface. “But I digress. Perenelle took the Stone fromBaba Yaga, and assumed the guise and name of Nicholas Flamel. Shealso kept her identity as Perenelle, calling herself Flamel’s wife. The twohave appeared together in public, but that might be done by any numberof obvious methods.”“And the Stone’s manufacture?” said Harry, his brain working to process all this. “I saw an alchemical recipe for it, in a book—”“Another lie. Perenelle was making it appear as though ‘NicholasFlamel’ had earned the right to live forever by completing a great magicthat any could attempt. And she was giving others a false path to pursue, instead of seeking the one true Stone as Perenelle had sought BabaYaga’s.” Professor Quirrell looked rather sour. “It should come as nosurprise that I spent years trying to master that false recipe. Next youwill ask why I did not kidnap, torture, and kill Perenelle after I learnedthe truth.”This had not in fact been a question that had come into Harry’s mind.Professor Quirrell continued to speak. “The answer is that Perenellehad foreseen and forestalled the ambitions of Dark Wizards like myself.‘Nicholas Flamel’ publicly took Unbreakable Vows not to be coerced by anymeans into relinquishing his Stone—to guard immortality from the covetous, he claimed, as if that were a public service. I was afraid the Stonewould be lost forever, if Perenelle died without saying where it was hidden, and her Vow prevented attempts at torture. Further, I had hopes ofgaining Perenelle’s knowledge, if I could find the right strategy to extractit from her. Though Perenelle began with little lore of her own, she hasheld hostage the lives of wizards greater than herself, holding out dribsand drabs of healing in exchange for secrets, and small reversals of agein exchange for power. Perenelle does not condescend to bestow any realyouth upon others—but if you hear of a wizard who lived, greybearded,to the age of two hundred and fifty, you may be sure that her hand wasin play. By my own generation, the centuries had given Perenelle enoughof an advantage that she could raise up Albus Dumbledore as a counterweight to the Dark Lord Grindelwald. When I appeared as Lord Voldemort, Perenelle raised up Dumbledore yet further, parceling out anotherdrop of her hoarded lore whenever Lord Voldemort seemed to gain an advantage. I felt like I ought to be able to figure out something clever to dowith that situation, but I never did. I did not attack her directly, for I wasnot sure of my great creation; it was not impossible that I would somedayneed to go begging to her for a dollop of reversed age.” Professor Quirrell dropped two bellflowers at once into the potion, and they seemed tomerge as they touched the bubbling liquid. “But now I am sure of my creation, and so I have decided that the time has come to take the Stone byforce.”Harry hesitated. “I would like to hear you answer in Parseltongue,was all of that true?”“None of it iss known to me to be falsse,” said Professor Quirrell. “Tellinga tale implies filling in certain gaps; I was not present to observe whenPerenelle seduced Baba Yaga. The bassicss sshould be mosstly correct, I think.”Harry had noticed a trace of confusion. “Then I don’t understand whythe Stone is here in Hogwarts. Wouldn’t the best defense just be hidingit under an anonymous rock in Greenland?”“Perhaps she respected my abilities as a particularly good finder,” saidthe Defense Professor. He appeared focused on his cauldron as he dippeda bellflower into a jar of liquid labeled with the Potions symbol for rainwater.We are very much alike, the Defense Professor and I, in some ways if not others.If I imagine what I’d do, given his problem…“Did you bluff everyone into believing you had some way of findingthe Stone?” Harry said aloud. “So that Perenelle would put it inside Hogwarts, where Dumbledore could guard it?”The Defense Professor sighed, not looking up from the cauldron. “Isuppose that strategem would be futile to conceal from you. Yes, afterI possessed Quirrell and returned, I implemented a strategy I had conceived while gazing at the stars. First I made sure to be accepted as Defense Professor at Hogwarts, for it would not do to have suspicions raisedwhile I was still seeking employment. When that was done, I arrangedfor one of Perenelle’s curse-breaking expeditions to discover a falsifiedbut credible inscription describing how the Crown of the Serpent couldbe used to seek out the Stone wherever it was hidden. Immediately after, before Perenelle could buy up the Crown, it was stolen; furthermoreI left clear indications that the thief had possessed the power to speak tosnakes. So Perenelle thought that I could infallibly find the Stone’s location, and that it needed a guardian powerful enough to defeat me. Thatis how the Stone came to be held in Hogwarts, in Dumbledore’s domain.Just as I intended, naturally, since I had already gained access to Hogwarts for the year. I think that is all of this that concerns you, if I speaknot of future plans.”Harry frowned. Professor Quirrell should not have told him that. Unless the strategy had somehow become irrelevant to any future deceptionof Perenelle…? Or unless, by answering so quickly, the Defense Professorhad hoped to have people conclude that it was a double-bluff, and that theCrown of the Serpent really could find the Stone…Harry decided not to question this answer in Parseltongue.Another lock of bright hair, seeming white but not with age, was gently dribbled into the cauldron, again reminding Harry that they were ona time limit. Harry considered, but he couldn’t see any further path topursue this line of questioning; there was no known way to manufacturemore Philosopher’s Stones and no obvious way to invent such, which wasprobably the objectively worst news Harry had heard all day.Harry took a deep breath. “I ask my third question,” Harry said.“What’s the truth behind this entire school year? All the plots you ran, allthe plots you know about.”“Hm,” said Professor Quirrell, dropping another bellflower into thepotion, accompanied by a plant-shape like a tiny cross. “Let me see… themost shocking twist is that the Defense Professor turns out to be secretlyVoldemort.”“Well, obviously,” Harry said, with a good deal of self-directed bitterness.“Then where do you wish me to start?”“Why did you kill Hermione?” The question just slipped out.Professor Quirrell’s pale eyes glanced up from the potion, watchedhim intently. “One would think that should be evident—but I suppose Icannot blame you for distrusting what seems evident. To understand theobject of an obscure plot, observe its consequences and ask who mighthave intended them. I killed Miss Granger to improve your position relative to that of Lucius Malfoy, since my plans did not call for him to have somuch leverage over you. I admit I am impressed by how far you managedto parlay that opening.”Harry unclenched his teeth, which took an effort. “That’s after yourfailed attempt to frame Hermione for the attempted murder of Draco andsend her to Azkaban because of why? Because you didn’t like the influenceshe was having on me?”“Don’t be ridiculous,” Professor Quirrell said. “If I had only wishedto remove Miss Granger, I would not have brought the Malfoys into it.I observed your game with Draco Malfoy and found it amusing, but Iknew it could not continue for very long before Lucius learned and intervened; and then your folly would have brought you great trouble, forLucius would not take it lightly. Had you just been able to lose during theWizengamot trial, lose as I had taught you, then in only two more weeks,ironclad evidence would have shown that Lucius Malfoy, after discovering his son’s seeming perfidy, had Imperiused Professor Sprout into using the Blood-Cooling Charm on Mr. Malfoy and casting the False Memory Charm on Miss Granger. Lucius would have been swept off the political gameboard, sent to exile if not Azkaban; Draco Malfoy would haveinherited the wealth of House Malfoy, and your influence over him wouldhave been unchallenged. Instead I had to abort that plot in mid-course.You managed to completely disrupt the real plan in the course of sacrificing double your entire fortune, by giving Lucius Malfoy the perfect oppor* 1736 *tunity to prove his true concern for his son. You have an incredible antitalent for meddling, I must say.”“And you also thought,” Harry said, even with his dark side’s patternshe had to work to keep his voice level and cool, “that two weeks in Azkaban would improve Miss Granger’s disposition, and get her to stop beinga bad influence on me. So you somehow arranged for there to be newspaper stories calling for her to be sent to Azkaban, rather than some otherpenalty.”Professor Quirrell’s lips drew up in a thin smile. “Good catch, boy.Yes, I thought she might serve as your Bellatrix. That particular outcomewould also have provided you with a constant reminder of how much respect was due the law, and helped you develop appropriate attitudes toward the Ministry.”“Your plot was stupidly complicated and had no chance of working.”Harry knew he ought to be more tactful, that he was engaging in more ofwhat Professor Quirrell called folly, but in that instant he could not bringhimself to care.“It was less complicated than Dumbledore’s plot to have the threearmies tie in the Christmas Battle, and not much more complicated thanmy own plot to make you think Dumbledore had blackmailed Mr. Zabini.The insight you are missing, Mr. Potter, is that these were not plots thatneeded to succeed.” Professor Quirrell continued to casually stir the potion, smiling. “There are plots that must succeed, where you keep the coreidea as simple as possible and take every precaution. There are also plotswhere it is acceptable to fail, and with those you can indulge yourself, ortest the limits of your ability to handle complications. It was not as ifsomething going wrong with any of those plots would have killed me.”Professor Quirrell was no longer smiling. “Our journey into Azkabanwas of the first type, and I was less amused by your antics there.”“What exactly did you do to Hermione?” Some part of Harry wonderedat the evenness of his voice.“Obliviations and False Memory Charms. I could not trust anythingelse to go undetected by the Hogwarts wards and the scrutiny I knew hermind would undergo.” A flicker of frustration crossed Professor Quirrell’s face. “Part of what you rightly call complication is because the firstversion of my plot did not go as planned, and I had to modify it. I cameto Miss Granger in the hallways wearing the appearance of ProfessorSprout, to offer her a conspiracy. My first attempt at suasion failed. IObliviated her and tried again with a new presentation. The second baitfailed. The third bait failed. The tenth bait failed. I was so frustratedthat I began going through my entire library of guises, including thosemore appropriate to Mr. Zabini. Still nothing worked. The child wouldnot violate her childish code.”“You do not get to call her childish, Professor.” Harry’s voice soundedstrange in his own ears. “Her code worked. It prevented you from trickingher. The whole point of having deontological ethical injunctions is thatarguments for violating them are often much less trustworthy than theylook. You don’t get to criticize her rules when they worked exactly as intended.” After they resurrected Hermione, Harry would tell her that LordVoldemort himself hadn’t been able to tempt her into doing wrong, andthat was why he’d killed her.“Fair enough, I suppose,” said Professor Quirrell. “There is a sayingthat even a stopped clock is right twice a day, and I do not think MissGranger was actually being reasonable. Still, Rule Ten: one must not rantabout the opposition’s unworthiness after they have foiled you. Regardless. After two full hours of failed attempts, I realized that I was beingover-stubborn, and that I did not need Miss Granger to carry out the exact part I had planned for her. I gave up on my original intent, and insteadimbued Miss Granger with False Memories of watching Mr. Malfoy plotting against her under circumstances that implied she should not tell youor the authorities. In the end it was Mr. Malfoy who gave me the openingI needed, entirely by luck.” Professor Quirrell dropped a bellflower and ascrap of parchment into the cauldron.“Why did the wards show the Defense Professor as having killed Hermione?”“I wore the mountain troll as a false tooth while Dumbledore was identifying me to the Hogwarts wards as the Defense Professor.” A slightsmile. “Other living weapons cannot be Transfigured; they will not survive the disenchantment for the requisite six hours to avoid being tracedby Time-Turner. The fact that a mountain troll was used as a weaponof assassination was a clear sign that the assassin had needed a proxyweapon that could be Transfigured safely. Combined with the evidenceof the wards, and Dumbledore’s own knowledge of how he had identifiedme to Hogwarts, you could have deduced who was responsible—in theory. However, experience has taught me that such puzzles are far harderto solve when you do not already know the solution, and I considered ita small risk. Ah, that reminds me, I have a question of my own.” TheDefense Professor was now giving Harry an intent look. “What gave meaway at the last, in the corridor outside these chambers?”Harry put aside other emotions to weigh up the cost and benefit of answering honestly, came to the conclusion that the Defense Professor wasgiving away far more information than he was getting (why?) and that itwas best not to give the appearance of reticence. “The main thing,” Harrysaid, “was that it was too improbable that everyone had arrived in Dumbledore’s corridor at the same time. I tried running with the hypothesisthat everyone who arrived had to be coordinated, including you.”“But I had said that I was following Snape,” the Defense Professorsaid. “Was that not plausible?”“It was, but…” Harry said. “Um. The laws governing what constitutesa good explanation don’t talk about plausible excuses you hear afterward.They talk about the probabilities we assign in advance. That’s why science makes people do advance predictions, instead of trusting explanations people come up with afterward. And I wouldn’t have predicted inadvance for you to follow Snape and show up like that. Even if I’d knownin advance that you could put a trace on Snape’s wand, I wouldn’t haveexpected you to do it and follow him just then. Since your explanationdidn’t make me feel like I would have predicted the outcome in advance,it remained an improbability. I started to wonder if Sprout’s mastermindmight have arranged for you to show up, too. And then I realised the noteto myself hadn’t really come from future-me, and that gave it away completely.”“Ah,” said the Defense Professor, and sighed. “Well, I think it is allworking out for the best. You did understand only too late; and therewould have been inconveniences as well as benefits to you remaining unaware.”“What on Earth were you trying to do? The reason I was trying so hardto figure it out was that the whole thing was just so weird.”“That should have pointed at Dumbledore, not myself,” said Professor Quirrell, and frowned. “The fact is that Miss Greengrass was not supposed to arrive in that corridor for several hours… though I suppose, sinceI did have Mr. Malfoy give her the clue I assigned her, it is not too surprising they banded together. Had Mr. Nott arrived seemingly alone, eventswould have played out less farcically. But I consider myself a specialist inbattlefield control magics, and I was able to ensure that the fight went asI wished. I suppose it did end up looking a bit ridiculous.” The DefenseProfessor dropped a peach slice and a bellflower into the cauldron. “Butlet us defer our discussion of the Mirror until we reach it. Did you haveany more questions concerning Miss Granger’s regrettable and hopefullytemporary demise?”“Yes,” Harry said in an even voice. “What did you do to the Weasleytwins? Dumbledore thought—I mean, the school saw the Headmaster goto the Weasley twins after Hermione was arrested. Dumbledore thoughtyou, as Voldemort, had wondered why Dumbledore had done so, andthat you’d checked on the Weasley twins, found and took their map, andObliviated them afterward?”“Dumbledore was quite correct,” Professor Quirrell said, shaking hishead as though in wonderment. “He was also an utter fool to leave theHogwarts Map in the possession of those two idiots. I had an unpleasantshock after I recovered the Map; it showed my name and yours correctly!The Weasley idiots had thought it a mere malfunction, especially afteryou received your Cloak and your Time-Turner. If Dumbledore had keptthe Map himself—if the Weasleys had ever spoken of it to Dumbledore—but they did not, thankfully.”Showed my name and yours correctly—“I would like to see that,” Harry said.Without taking his eyes from the cauldron, Professor Quirrell drew afolded parchment from within his robes, hissed at it “Sshow our ssurroundingss”, and tossed the folded parchment toward Harry. It cut unerringlythrough the air, an increase of doom breathing on Harry’s senses as itmoved toward him, and then it fluttered gently to Harry’s feet.Harry picked up the parchment and unfolded it.At first the parchment seemed blank. Then, as though an unseen penwere moving across it, the outline of walls and doors appeared, all drawnin handwritten lines. The writing outlined a series of chambers, mostof them shown as empty; the last chamber in the series had a confusedscribble in its center, as though the Map were trying to indicate its own bewilderment; and the second-to-last chamber showed two names within,written in positions within the chamber corresponding to where Harrywas sitting and Professor Quirrell was standing.Tom M. Riddle.Tom M. Riddle.Harry gazed at the parchment, an unpleasant chill coming over him.It was one thing to hear Lord Voldemort claim that your name was TomRiddle; it was another thing to find that Hogwarts’s magic agreed. “Didyou tamper with thiss map to achieve thiss ressult, or did it appear before you by ssurprisse?”“Wass ssurprisse,” replied Professor Quirrell, with an overtone of hissing laughter. “No trickss.”Harry folded the Map and threw it back in Professor Quirrell’s direction; some force caught it in midair before it reached the floor, and drewthe Map back into Professor Quirrell’s robes.The Defense Professor spoke. “I should also like to volunteer thatSnape was guiding Miss Granger and her underlings toward bullies, andsometimes intervening to protect them.”“I knew that.”“Interesting,” said Professor Quirrell. “Did Dumbledore also learn ofthis? Answer in Parseltongue.”“Not sso far ass I know,” hissed Harry.“Fascinating,” said Professor Quirrell. “You may be interested toknow this as well: Potionss-maker had to work in ssecret because hiss plot oppossed sschoolmasster's plot.”Harry thought about this, while Professor Quirrell blew on the potionas though to cool it, though the fire still burned under the cauldron; thenadded a pinch of dirt and a drop of water and a bellflower. “Please explain,” Harry said.1741 *“Has it never occurred to you to wonder why Dumbledore choseSeverus Snape as the Head of House Slytherin? To say that it was a coverfor his work as Dumbledore’s spy explains nothing. Snape could havebeen a Potions Master only, and not the Head of Slytherin at all. Snapecould have been made Keeper of Grounds and Keys, if he needed to staywithin Hogwarts! Why the Head of House Slytherin? Surely it occurred toyou that this could not have good effects upon the Slytherins, accordingto Dumbledore’s moral pretenses?”The thought hadn’t occurred to Harry in exactly those terms, no… “Iwondered something like it. I didn’t put the dilemma in that preciseform.”“And now that you have, is the solution obvious?”“No,” Harry said.“Disappointing. You have not learned enough cynicism, you have notgrasped the flexibility of what moralists call morality. To fathom a plot,look at the consequences and ask if they might be intended. Dumbledorewas deliberately sabotaging Slytherin House—don’t give me that look,boy, I am sspeaking truth. During the last Wizarding War, Slytherins filledout my ranks of underlings, and other Slytherins in the Wizengamot supported me. Look at it from Dumbledore’s perspective, and remember thathe has no native understanding of Slytherin’s ways. Think of Dumbledore becoming increasingly sad over this Hogwarts House that seemsthe source of so much ill-doing. And then behold, Dumbledore puts inas Head of Slytherin the person of Snape. Snape! Severus Snape! Aman who would teach his House neither cunning nor ambition, a manwho would impose lax discipline and make its children weak! A man whowould offend students of other Houses, who would ruin Slytherin’s nameamong them! A man whose surname was unknown in magical Britainand certainly not noble, who went about half in rags! Do you think Dumbledore ignorant of the consequence? When Dumbledore was the one whobrought it about, and had motive to bring it about? I expect Dumbledoretold himself that more lives would be saved during the next WizardingWar if Voldemort’s future Death Eaters were weakened.” Professor Quirrell dropped into the cauldron a chip of ice, slowly melting as it touchedthe surface froth. “Continue the process long enough, and no child wouldwant to go to Slytherin. The House would be retired, and if the Hat keptcalling the name, it would become a mark of ignominy among childrenwho would afterward be distributed among the other three Houses. Fromthat day on, Hogwarts would have three upstanding Houses of courageand scholarship and industry, with no House of Bad Children added tothe mix; just as if the three Founders of Hogwarts had been wise enoughin the beginning to refuse Salazar Slytherin their company. That, I expect, was Dumbledore’s intended end-game; a short-term sacrifice forthe greater good.” Professor Quirrell smiled sardonically. “And Luciuslet it all happen without protest or even, I expect, noticing that anythingwas going awry. I fear that in my absence my former servants have beenquite outmatched in this battle of wits.”Harry was having a bit of trouble taking this in, but decided, aftersome thought, that now was not the time to try to work it out. WhetherLord Voldemort believed it was not decisive; Harry would have to evaluatethis accusation on his own.Professor Quirrell’s mention of his servants had reminded Harry ofsomething else that he was… obligated, Harry supposed, to ask. The badnews was predictable. On any other day it would have been horrible.Today it would just wash out in the flood. “Bellatrix Black,” Harry said.“What was the truth about her?”“She was broken inside before I ever met her,” Professor Quirrell said.He picked up what looked like a white-grey rubber band and held it overthe cauldron; as the rubber was held within the steam, it turned black.“Using Legilimency on her was a mistake. But that glimpse showed mehow easy it would be to make her fall in love with me, so I did. Ever aftershe was the most faithful of all my servants, the only one I could almosttrust. I had no intention of giving her what she wanted from me; so Icommended her to the Lestrange brothers for their use, and the three ofthem were happy in their own special way.”“I doubt it,” Harry’s mouth said, mostly on autopilot. “If that weretrue, Bellatrix wouldn’t have remembered who the Lestrange brotherswere, when we found her in Azkaban.”Professor Quirrell shrugged. “You may be right.”“What the hell were we actually doing there?”“Finding out where Bellatrix had put my wand. I had told the DeathEaters of my immortality, in the hope—now proven futile—that theywould stay together for at least a few days if I appeared to die. Bellatrix’sinstructions were to recover my wand from wherever my body had beenslain; and take that wand to a certain graveyard where my spirit wouldappear before her.”Harry swallowed. The image came to him of Bellatrix Black waiting,waiting, waiting at the graveyard, in increasing desperation… it was nowonder she hadn’t been thinking strategically when she attacked theLongbottom household. “What did you do with Bellatrix once she wasout?”“Ssent her to a peaceful place to recover sstrength,” Professor Quirrell said. Acold smile. “I had a use remaining for her, or rather a certain portion ofher, and on my future plans I shall not answer questions.”Harry breathed deeply, trying to maintain control. “Were there anyother secret plots in this school year?”“Oh, a fair number, but not many more that concern you, not that Ican think of offhand. The true reason I demanded to try to teach the Patronus Charm to first-years was to bring a Dementor before your own person, and then I arranged for your wand to fall where the Dementor couldcontinue to drain you through it. Wass no malice in it, only hopess that youwould recover ssome of your true memoriess. That was also why I arranged forcertain witches to pull you down from the air during your rooftop episode,so I could appear to save your life; just in case any suspicion fell on me during the Dementor incident I had scheduled for shortly after. Alsso no malicethere. I arranged some of the attacks on Miss Granger’s group, so that theattacks could be defeated; I do rather dislike bullies. Think that iss all ssecretplotss concerning you from thiss sschool-year, unless I have forgotten ssomething.”Life lesson learned, said his Hufflepart. Try to resist the temptation to randomly meddle in other people’s lives. Like, you know, Padma Patil’s life. If youdon’t want to end up like this, that is.A pinch of red-brown dust was gently sifted into the potions cauldron,and Harry asked his fourth and final question, the one that had seemedto have the lowest priority, but still mattered.“What was your objective during the Wizarding War?” Harry said. “Imean, what—” His voice wobbled. “What was the point of the entire thing?”His brain repeating endlessly, Why, why, why Lord Voldemort…Professor Quirrell lifted an eyebrow. “They told you about David Monroe, did they not?”“Yes you were both David Monroe and Lord Voldemort during theWizarding War, I understood that part. You killed David Monroe, disguised yourself as him, and wiped out David Monroe’s family so theywouldn’t notice any differences—”“Indeed.”“You planned to control whichever side won the Wizarding War, regardless of which side won. But why did one side have to be Voldemort? I,I mean, wouldn’t it have been easier to gain public support with someoneless… with someone less Voldemort?”Professor Quirrell’s mallet made an unusually loud thud as it crushedwhite butterfly wings, mixing them with another bellflower. “I planned,”Professor Quirrell said harshly, “for Lord Voldemort to lose to David Monroe. The flaw in that strategy was the absolute wretchedness of—” Professor Quirrell stopped. “No, I am telling the tale out of order. Listen, boy,when I had devised my great creation and come into the fullness of mymagic, I thought the time had come for me to take political power intomy hands. It would be inconvenient, certainly, and take up my time inways that were not enjoyable. But I knew the Muggles would eventuallydestroy the world or make war on wizardkind or both, and somethinghad to be done if I was not to wander a dead or dull world through myeternity. Having attained immortality I needed a new ambition to occupy my decades, and to prevent the Muggles from ruining everythingseemed a goal of acceptable scope and difficulty. It is a source of continual amusement to me that I, of all people, am the only one really takingaction towards that end. Though I suppose it would make sense for themortal insects not to care about their world’s end; why should they, whenthey are just going to die regardless, and can save themselves the inconvenience of trying to do anything difficult along the way? But I digress. Isaw how Dumbledore had risen to power from his defeat of Grindelwald,so I thought I would do the same. I had long ago taken my vengeanceon David Monroe—he was an annoyance from my year in Slytherin—soI bethought to also steal his identity, and wipe out his family to make myself heir of his House. And I conceived also a great foe for David Monroeto fight, the most terrifying Dark Lord imaginable, clever beyond reckoning; more dangerous by far than Grindelwald, for his intelligence wouldbe perfected in all the ways that Grindelwald had been flawed and selfdestructive. A Dark Lord who would do his cunning utmost to disruptthe alliances who would fight him, a Dark Lord who would command thedeepest loyalty from his followers through his oratical skills. The mostdreadful Dark Lord who had ever threatened Britain or the world, thatwas who David Monroe would defeat.”Professor Quirrell’s mallet struck a bellflower and then a differentpale flower with two more thuds. “But then, while I had sometimes playedthe part of Dark Wizard in my wanderings, I had never adopted the identity of a full-fledged Dark Lord with underlings and a political agenda. Ihad no practice at the task, and I was mindful of the story of Dark Evangel and the disaster of her first public appearance. According to what shesaid afterward, she had meant to call herself the Walking Catastropheand the Apostle of Darkness, but in the excitement of the moment sheintroduced herself as the Apostrophe of Darkness instead. After that shehad to ruin two entire villages before anyone took her seriously.”“So you decided to try a small-scale experiment first,” Harry said. Asickness rose up in him, because in that moment Harry understood, he sawhimself reflected; the next step was just what Harry himself would havedone, if he’d had no trace of ethics whatsoever, if he’d been that emptyinside. “You created a disposable identity, to learn how the ropes worked,and get your mistakes out of the way.”“Indeed. Before becoming a truly terrible Dark Lord for David Monroe to fight, I first created for practice the persona of a Dark Lord withglowing red eyes, pointlessly cruel to his underlings, pursuing a politicalagenda of naked personal ambition combined with blood purism as argued by drunks in Knocturn Alley. My first underlings were hired in atavern, given cloaks and skull masks, and told to introduce themselves asDeath Eaters.”The sick sense of understanding deepened, in the pit of Harry’s stomach. “And you called yourself Voldemort.”“Just so, General Chaos.” Professor Quirrell was grinning, fromwhere he stood by the cauldron. “I wanted it to be an anagram of myname, but that would only have worked if I’d conveniently been giventhe middle name of ‘Marvolo’, and then it would have been a stretch.Our actual middle name is Morfin, if you’re curious. But I digress. Ithought Voldemort’s career would last only a few months, a year at thelongest, before the Aurors brought down his underlings and the disposable Dark Lord vanished. As you perceive, I had vastly overestimated mycompetition. And I could not quite bring myself to torture my underlingswhen they brought me bad news, no matter what Dark Lords did inplays. I could not quite manage to argue the tenets of blood purism asincoherently as if I were a drunk in Knockturn Alley. I was not trying tobe clever when I sent my underlings on their missions, but neither didI give them entirely pointless orders—” Professor Quirrell gave a ruefulgrin that, in another context, might have been called charming. “Onemonth after that, Bellatrix Black prostrated herself before me, and afterthree months Lucius Malfoy was negotiating with me over glasses ofexpensive Firewhiskey. I sighed, gave up all hope for wizardkind, andbegan as David Monroe to oppose this fearsome Lord Voldemort.”“And then what happened—”A snarl contorted Professor Quirrell’s face. “The absolute inadequacyof every single institution in the civilization of magical Britain is whathappened! You cannot comprehend it, boy! I cannot comprehend it! Ithas to be seen and even then it cannot be believed! You will have observed,perhaps, that of your fellow students who speak of their family’s occupations, three in four seem to mention jobs in some part or another of theMinistry. You will wonder how a country can manage to employ three ofits four citizens in bureaucracy. The answer is that if they did not all prevent each other from doing their jobs, none of them would have any workleft to do! The Aurors were competent as individual fighters, they didfight Dark Wizards and only the best survived to train new recruits, buttheir leadership was in absolute disarray. The Ministry was so busy routing papers that the country had no effective opposition to Voldemort’sattacks except myself, Dumbledore, and a handful of untrained irregulars. A shiftless, incompetent, cowardly layabout, Mundungus Fletcher,was considered a key asset in the Order of the Phoenix—because, beingotherwise unemployed, he did not need to juggle another job! I triedweakening Voldemort’s attacks, to see if it was possible for him to lose;at once the Ministry committed fewer Aurors to oppose me! I had readMao’s Little Red Book, I had trained my Death Eaters in guerilla tactics—for nothing! For nothing! I was attacking all of magical Britain and inevery engagement my forces outnumbered their opposition! In desperation, I ordered my Death Eaters to systematically assassinate every single incompetent managing the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.One paper-pusher after another volunteered to accept higher positionsdespite the fate of their predecessors, gleefully rubbing their hands atthe prospect of promotion. Every one of them thought they would cut adeal with Lord Voldemort on the side. It took seven months to murder ourway through them all, and not a single Death Eater asked why we werebothering. And then, even with Bartemius Crouch risen to Director andAmelia Bones as Head Auror, it was still too little. I could have done betterfighting alone. Dumbledore’s aid was not worth his moral restraints, andCrouch’s aid was not worth his respect for the law.” Professor Quirrellturned up the fire beneath the potion.“And eventually,” Harry said through the heart-sickness, “you realizedyou were just having more fun as Voldemort.”“It is the least annoying role I have ever played. If Lord Voldemortsays that something is to be done, people obey him and do not argue. I didnot have to suppress my impulse to Cruciate people being idiots; for onceit was all part of the role. If someone was making the game less pleasantfor me, I just said Avadakedavra regardless of whether that was strategically wise, and they never bothered me again.” Professor Quirrell casually chopped a small worm into bits. “But my true epiphany came on acertain day when David Monroe was trying to get an entry permit for anAsian instructor in combat tactics, and a Ministry clerk denied it, smiling smugly. I asked the Ministry clerk if he understood that this measurewas meant to save his life and the Ministry clerk only smiled more. Thenin fury I threw aside masks and caution, I used my Legilimency, I dippedmy fingers into the cesspit of his stupidity and tore out the truth from hismind. I did not understand and I wanted to understand. With my com* 1748 *mand of Legilimency I forced his tiny clerk-brain to live out alternatives,seeing what his clerk-brain would think of Lucius Malfoy, or Lord Voldemort, or Dumbledore standing in my place.” Professor Quirrell’s handshad slowed, as he delicately peeled bits and small strips from a chunk ofcandle-wax. “What I finally realized that day is complicated, boy, whichis why I did not understand it earlier in life. To you I shall try to describeit anyway. Today I know that Dumbledore does not stand at the top ofthe world, for all that he is the Supreme Mugwump of the InternationalConfederation. People speak ill of Dumbledore openly, they criticize himproudly and to his face, in a way they would not dare stand up to LuciusMalfoy. You have acted disrespectfully toward Dumbledore, boy, do youknow why you did so?”“I’m… not sure,” Harry said. Having Tom Riddle’s leftover neural patterns was certainly an obvious hypothesis.“Wolves, dogs, even chickens, fight for dominance among themselves.What I finally understood, from that clerk’s mind, was that to him Lucius Malfoy had dominance, Lord Voldemort had dominance, and DavidMonroe and Albus Dumbledore did not. By taking the side of good, byprofessing to abide in the light, we had made ourselves unthreatening. InBritain, Lucius Malfoy has dominance, for he can call in your loans, orsend Ministry bureaucrats against your shop, or crucify you in the DailyProphet, if you go openly against his will. And the most powerful wizardin the world has no dominance, because everyone knows that he is,” Professor Quirrell’s lips curled, “a hero out of stories, relentlessly self-effacingand too humble for vengeance. Tell me, child, have you ever seen a dramawhere the hero, before he consents to save his country, demands so muchgold as a barrister might receive for a court case?”“Actually there have been a lot of heroes like that in Muggle fiction, I’llname Han Solo just to start—”“Well, in magical drama it is not so. It is all humble heroes like Dumbledore. It is the fantasy of the powerful slave who will never truly riseabove you, never demand your respect, never even ask you for pay. Doyou understand now?”“I… think so,” Harry said. Frodo and Samwise from Lord of the Ringsdid seem to match the archetype of a completely non-threatening hero.“You’re saying that’s how people think of Dumbledore? I don’t believe theHogwarts students see him as a hobbit.”“In Hogwarts, Dumbledore does punish certain transgressionsagainst his will, so he is feared to some degree—though the studentsstill make free to mock him in more than whispers. Outside this castle,Dumbledore is sneered at; they began to call him mad, and he aped thepart like a fool. Step into the role of a savior out of plays, and people seeyou as a slave to whose services they are entitled and whom it is theirenjoyment to criticize; for it is the privilege of masters to sit back andcall forth helpful corrections while the slaves labor. Only in the tales ofthe ancient Greeks, from when men were less sophisticated in their delusions, may you see the hero who is also high. Hector, Aeneas, those wereheroes who retained their right of vengeance upon those who insultedthem, who could demand gold and jewels in payment for their serviceswithout sparking indignation. And if Lord Voldemort conquered Britain,he might then condescend to show himself noble in victory; and nobodywould take his goodwill for granted, nor chirp corrections at him if hiswork was not to their liking. When he won, he would have true respect. Iunderstood that day in the Ministry that by envying Dumbledore, I hadshown myself as deluded as Dumbledore himself. I understood that Ihad been trying for the wrong place all along. You should know this tobe true, boy, for you have made freer to speak ill of Dumbledore thanyou ever dared speak ill of me. Even in your own thoughts, I wager, forinstinct runs deep. You knew that it might be to your cost to mock thestrong and vengeful Professor Quirrell, but that there was no cost indisrespecting the weak and harmless Dumbledore.”“Thank you,” Harry said through the pain, “for that valuable lesson,Professor Quirrell, I see that you are right about what my mind was doing.” Though Tom Riddle’s memories had probably also had something todo with the way he had sometimes lashed out at Dumbledore for no goodreason, Harry hadn’t been like that around Professor McGonagall… whoadmittedly had the power to deduct House Points and didn’t have Dumbledore’s air of tolerance… no, it was still true, Harry would have beenmore respectful even in his own thoughts if Dumbledore had not seemedsafe to disrespect.So that had been David Monroe, and that had been Lord Voldemort…It still hadn’t answered the most puzzling question, and Harry wasn’tsure that asking it would be wise. If, somehow, Lord Voldemort had managed not to think of it, and then Professor Quirrell had still managed not tothink of it during nine years of contemplation, then it wasn’t wise to say…or maybe it was; the agonies of the Wizarding War had not been good forBritain.Harry decided, and spoke. “One thing that did confuse me was whythe Wizarding War lasted so long,” Harry ventured. “I mean, maybe I’munderestimating the difficulties that were facing Lord Voldemort—”“You want to know why I did not Imperius some of the strongerwizards who could Imperius others, slay the very strongest wizardswho could have resisted my Imperius, and take over the Ministry in, oh,perhaps three days.”Harry nodded silently.Professor Quirrell looked contemplative; his hand was sifting grassclippings into the cauldron, bit by bit. That ingredient, if Harry remembered correctly, was something like four-fifths towards the end of therecipe.“I wondered that myself,” the Defense Professor said finally, “when Iheard Trelawney’s prophecy from Snape, and I contemplated the past aswell as the future. If you had asked my past self why he did not use theImperius, he would have spoken of the need to be seen to rule, to openlycommand the Ministry bureaucracy, before it was time to turn his eyesoutward to other countries. He would have remarked on how a quickand silent victory might bring challenges later. He would have remarkedon the obstacle presented by Dumbledore and his incredible defensiveprowess. And he would have had similar excuses for every other quickpath he considered. Somehow it was never the right time to bring myplans to their final phase, there was always one more thing to do first.Then I heard the prophecy and I knew that it was time, for Time itself wastaking notice of me. That the span for hesitation was done. And I lookedback, and realised somehow this had been going on for years. I think…”The occasional bit of grass was still dropping down from his hand, butProfessor Quirrell did not seem to pay it any mind. “I thought, when1751 *I was contemplating my past beneath the starlight, that I had becometoo accustomed to playing against Dumbledore. Dumbledore was intelligent, he tried diligently to be cunning, he did not wait for me to strike butpresented me with surprises. He made bizarre moves that played out infascinating and unpredictable ways. In retrospect, there were many obvious plans for destroying Dumbledore; but I think some part of me did notwant to go back to playing solitaire instead of chess. It was when I had theprospect of creating another Tom Riddle to plot against, someone evenmore worthy than Dumbledore, that I was first willing to contemplatethe end of my war. Yes, in retrospect that sounds stupid, but sometimesour emotions are more foolish than we can bring our reason to admit. Iwould never have espoused such a policy deliberately. It would have violated Rules Nine, Sixteen, Twenty, and Twenty-two and that is too mucheven if you are enjoying yourself. But to repeatedly decide that there wasone more thing left to be done, one more advantage left to be gained, onemore piece that I simply had to move into place, before abandoning anenjoyable time in my life and moving on to the more tedious rulership ofBritain… well, even I am not immune to a mistake like that, if I do notrealize that I am making it.”And that was when Harry knew what was going to happen at the endof this, after the Philosopher’s Stone had been retrieved.At the end of this, Professor Quirrell was going to kill him.Professor Quirrell didn’t want to kill him. It was possible that Harrywas the only person in the world against whom Professor Quirrell wouldn’tbe able to use a Killing Curse. But Professor Quirrell thought he had todo it, for whatever reason.That was why Professor Quirrell had decided that it was necessary tobrew the potion of effulgence the long way. That was why Professor Quirrell had been so easily negotiated into answering these questions, intofinally talking about his life with someone who might understand. Justlike Lord Voldemort had delayed the end of the Wizarding War to playlonger against Dumbledore.Harry couldn’t exactly recall what Professor Quirrell had said earlierabout not killing Harry. It hadn’t been anything straightforward alongthe lines of ‘I am absolutely not planning to kill you in any way, shape,or form unless you positively insist on doing something stupid’. Harryhad been reluctant himself to push the promise too far and insist on unambiguous terms because Harry had already known that he would needto neutralize Lord Voldemort and had expected more precise language toreveal that fact, if they tried to exchange truly binding promises. So therecertainly would have been loopholes, whatever had been said.There was no particular shock to the realization, just an increasedsense of urgency; some part of Harry had already known this, and hadsimply been waiting for an excuse to make it known to deliberation.There had been too many things said here that Professor Quirrell wouldnot reveal to anyone with an expected lifespan measured in more thanhours. The overwhelming isolation and loneliness of the life ProfessorQuirrell had described might explain why he was willing to violate hisRules and talk with Harry, given that Harry was going to die soon and thatthe world did not actually work like a play where the villain disclosinghis plans would always fail to kill the hero afterward. But Harry’s deathcertainly had to be in those future plans somewhere.Harry swallowed, controlling his breathing. Professor Quirrell hadjust added a tuft of horsehair to the potion of effulgence, and that was verylate in the potion, if Harry remembered correctly. There weren’t manybellflowers left in the heap to be added, either.It was probably time to stop worrying so much about risk and playthis conversation less conservatively, all things considered.“If I point out one of Lord Voldemort’s mistakes,” Harry said, “doeshe punish me for it?”Professor Quirrell lifted his eyebrows. “Not if the mistake is a real one.I do not suggest that you moralise at me. But I would not curse the bearerof bad news, nor the subordinate who makes an honest attempt to pointout a problem. Even as Lord Voldemort I could never bring myself to thatstupidity. Of course, there were some fools who mistook my policy forweakness, who tried to thrust themselves forward by pushing me downin their public counsel, thinking me obliged to tolerate it as criticism.”Professor Quirrell smiled reminiscently. “The Death Eaters were betteroff without them, and I do not advise you make the same mistake.”Harry nodded, a slight shiver going through him. “Um, when you toldme about what happened in Godric’s Hollow, on Halloween night, in 1981I mean, um… I thought I saw another flaw in your reasoning. A way youcould have avoided disaster. But, um, I think you have a blind spot, a classof strategies you don’t consider, so you didn’t see it even afterward—”“I hope you are not about to say anything stupid along the lines of‘don’t try to kill people’,” Professor Quirrell said. “I shall be unhappy ifthat is the case.”“Not valuess difference. True misstake, given your goalss. Will you hurt me, if Iact the part of the teacher toward you, and teach lessson? Or if misstake is ssimpleand obviousss, and makess you feel sstupid?”“No,” hissed Professor Quirrell. “Not if lessson iss true.”Harry swallowed. “Um. Why didn’t you test the horcrux system before you actually had to use it?”“Test it?” said Professor Quirrell. He looked up from the brewing potion, and indignation came into his voice. “What do you mean, test it?”“Why didn’t you test if the horcrux system was working correctly, before you needed it on Halloween?”Professor Quirrell looked disgusted. “You ridiculous—I didn’t wantto die, Mr. Potter, and that was the only way to test my great creation!What good would it have done to risk my life sooner rather than later?How would I have been better off?”Harry swallowed a lump in his throat. “There wass way for you to tesst yourhorcrux ssysstem without dying. The general lesson is important. Do you seeit now?”“No,” Professor Quirrell said after a while. The Defense Professorgently crumbled one of the last bellflowers together with a strand of longblonde hair and then dropped it into the potion, which was bubblingbrighter, now. Only two more bellflowers remained on the Potions table.“And I do hope your lesson is a sensible one, for your sake.”“Suppose, Professor, that I learned how to cast the improved horcruxspell and I was willing to use it. What would I do with it?”Professor Quirrell answered at once. “You would find some personwhom you found morally abhorrent and whose death you could convinceyourself would save other lives, and murder them to create a horcrux.”“And then what?”“Make more horcruxes,” said the Defense Professor. He picked up ajar of what looked like dragon scales.“Before that,” Harry said.After a time the Defense Professor shook his head. “I still do not seeit, and you will cease this game and tell me.”“I would make horcruxes for my friends. If you’d ever really caredabout one single other person in the entire world, if there’d been just oneperson who gave your immortality meaning, someone that you wantedto live forever with you—” Harry’s throat choked. “Then, then the ideaof making a horcrux for someone else wouldn’t have been such a counterintuitive thought.” Harry was blinking hard. “You have a blind spotaround strategies that involve doing nice things for other people, to thepoint where it stops you from achieving your selfish values. You think…it’s not your style, I suppose. That… particular part of your self-image… iswhat cost you those nine years.”The dropper of mint oil that the Defense Professor was holding addedliquid to the cauldron, drip by drip.“I see…” the Defense Professor said slowly. “I see. I should have taughtRabastan the advanced horcrux ritual, and forced him to test the invention. Yes, that is supremely obvious in retrospect. For that matter, I couldhave ordered Rabastan to try marking himself onto some disposable infant, to see what happened, before I took myself to Godric’s Hollow tocreate you.” Professor Quirrell shook his head bemusedly. “Well. I amglad I am realizing this now and not ten years earlier; I had enough tochide myself for at that time.”“You don’t see nice ways to do the things you want to do,” Harry said.His ears heard a note of desperation in his own voice. “Even when a nicestrategy would be more effective you don’t see it because you have a selfimage of not being nice.”“That is a fair observation,” said Professor Quirrell. “Indeed, now thatyou have pointed it out, I have just now thought of some nice things I cando this very day, to further my agenda.”Harry just looked at him.Professor Quirrell was smiling. “Your lesson is a good one, Mr. Potter.From now on, until I learn the trick of it, I shall keep diligent watch forcunning strategies that involve doing kindnesses for other people. Goand practice acts of goodwill, perhaps, until my mind goes there easily.”Cold chills ran down Harry’s spine.Professor Quirrell had said this without the slightest visible hesitation.Lord Voldemort was absolutely certain that he could never be redeemed. He wasn’t the tiniest bit afraid of it happening to him.The second-to-last bellflower was dropped into the potion, gently.“Any other valuable lessons you would like to teach to Lord Voldemort,boy?” said Professor Quirrell. He was looking up from the potion, andgrinning as though he knew exactly what Harry was thinking.“Yes,” Harry said, his voice almost breaking. “If your goal is to obtainhappiness, then doing nice things for other people feels better than doingthem for yourself—”“Do you really think I never thought of that, boy?” The smile had vanished. “Do you think I am stupid? After graduating Hogwarts I wanderedthe world for years, before I returned to Britain as Lord Voldemort. I haveput on more faces than I bothered counting. Do you think I never triedto play the hero, just to see how it would feel? Have you come across thename of Alexander Chernyshov? Under that guise, I sought out a forlornhellhole ruled over by a Dark Wizard, and I freed the wretched inhabitants from their bondage. They wept tears of gratitude for me. It did notfeel like anything in particular. I even stayed about and killed the nextfive Dark Wizards to try taking command of the place. I spent my ownGalleons—well, not my own Galleons, but the same principle applies—to prettify their little country and introduce a semblance of order. Theygroveled all the more, and named one in three of their infants Alexander.I still felt nothing, so I nodded to myself, wrote it off as a fair try, andwent upon my way.”“And were you happy as Lord Voldemort, then?” Harry’s voice hadrisen, grown wild.Professor Quirrell hesitated, then shrugged. “It appears you alreadyknow the answer to that.”“Then why? Why be Voldemort if it doesn’t even make you happy?”Harry’s voice broke. “I’m you, I’m based on you, so I know that ProfessorQuirrell isn’t just a mask! I know he’s somebody you really could havebeen! Why not just stay that way? Take your curse off the DefensePosition and just stay here, use the Philosopher’s Stone to take DavidMonroe’s shape and let the real Quirinus Quirrell go free, if you say you’llstop killing people I’ll swear not to tell anyone who you really are, justbe Professor Quirrell, for always! Your students would appreciate you, myfather’s students appreciate him—”Professor Quirrell was chuckling over the cauldron as he stirred it.“There are perhaps fifteen thousand wizards living in magical Britain,child. There used to be more. There’s a reason they’re afraid to speak myname. You’d forgive me that because you liked my Battle Magic lessons?”Seconded, said Harry’s inner Hufflepuff. Seriously, what the hell?Harry kept his head raised, though it was trembling. “It’s not my placeto forgive anything you’ve done. But it’s better than another war.”“Ha,” said the Defense Professor. “If you ever find a Time-Turner thatgoes back forty years and can alter history, be sure to tell Dumbledore thatbefore he rejects Tom Riddle’s application for the Defense position. Butalas, I fear that Professor Riddle would not have found lasting happinessin Hogwarts.”“Why not?”“Because I still would’ve been surrounded by idiots, and I wouldn’thave been able to kill them,” Professor Quirrell said mildly. “Killing idiotsis my great joy in life, and I’ll thank you not to speak ill of it until you’vetried it for yourself.”“There’s something that would make you happier than that,” Harrysaid, his voice breaking again. “There has to be.”“Why?” said Professor Quirrell. “Is this some scientific law I have notyet encountered? Tell me of it.”Harry opened his mouth, but couldn’t find any words, there had to besomething had to be something if he could just find the right thing to say—“And you,” said Professor Quirrell, “have no right to speak of happiness either. Happiness is not what you hold precious above all. You decided that in the beginning, all the way back in the beginning of this year,when the Sorting Hat offered you Hufflepuff. Which I know about, because I received a similar offer and warning all those years ago, and Irefused it just as you did. Beyond this there is little more to say, betweenTom Riddles.” The Defense Professor turned back to the cauldron.Before Harry could think of any way to reply, Professor Quirrelldropped in the last bellflower, and a burst of glowing bubbles boiled upfrom the cauldron.“I believe we are done here,” Professor Quirrell said. “If you have further questions, they must wait.”Harry shakily rose to his feet; even as Professor Quirrell took up thecauldron and poured out a ridiculously huge volume of effulgent liquid,more than seemed like it could fit in a dozen cauldrons, onto the purplefire that guarded the doorway.The purple fire winked out.“Now for the Mirror,” said Professor Quirrell, and he drew forth theCloak of Invisibility from his robes, and floated it to drop before Harry’sshoes.ven the greatest artifact can be defeated by a counter-artifact that is lesser, butspecialized.That was what the Defense Professor had told Harry, after droppingthe True Cloak of Invisibility to pool in fuliginous folds near Harry’sshoes.The Mirror of Perfect Reflection has power over what is reflected within it, andthat power is said to be unchallengeable. But since the True Cloak of Invisibilityproduces a perfect absence of image, it should evade this principle rather than challenging it.There had followed a series of questions in Parseltongue establishingthat Harry currently did not intend to do anything stupid or try to runaway, and further reminders that Professor Quirrell could sense him andhad spells to detect the Cloak and was holding hostage hundreds of livesplus Hermione.Then Harry was told to don the Cloak, open the door that lay beyondthe quenched fires, and advance through the door into the final chamber;as Professor Quirrell stood well back, outside of that door’s sight.The last chamber was illuminated in lights of soft gold, and the stonewalls were of gentle white and faced with marble.In the center of the room stood a simple and unornamented goldenframe, and within the frame was a portal to another gold-illuminatedroom, beyond whose door which lay another Potions chamber; that waswhat Harry’s brain told him. The Mirror’s transformation of light wasso perfect that conscious thought was required to deduce that the roominside the frame was only a reflection, rather than a portal. (Though itmight have been easier to intuit if Harry hadn’t been invisible, just then.)The Mirror did not touch the ground; the golden frame had no feet. Itdidn’t look like it was hovering; it looked like it was fixed in place, moresolid and more motionless than the walls themselves, like it was nailed tothe reference frame of the Earth’s motion.“Is the Mirror there? Is it moving?” came Professor Quirrell’s commanding voice from the Potions Chamber.“Iss there,” Harry hissed back. “Not moving.”Again tones of command rang forth. “Walk around to the back of theMirror.”From behind, the golden frame appeared solid, showing no reflections, and Harry said so in Parseltongue.“Now take off your Cloak,” commanded Professor Quirrell’s voice stillfrom within the Potions room. “Report to me at once if the Mirror movesto face you.”Harry took off his Cloak.The Mirror remained nailed to the reference frame of Earth’s motion;and Harry reported this.Shortly after there came a hissing and seething, and a balefirephoenix melted through the marble wall behind Harry, the ambientlight in the room taking on a red tinge as it entered. Professor Quirrellfollowed behind it, walking out of the new-made corridor that had beencarved, his black formal shoes unharmed by the red-glowing moltensurface beneath. “Well,” Professor Quirrell said, “that is one possible trapaverted. And now…” Professor Quirrell exhaled. “Now we will think ofpossible strategies for retrieving the Stone from the Mirror, and you willtry them; for I prefer not to let my own image be reflected. I give you fairwarning, this is the part that may prove tedious.”“I take it this isn’t a problem you can solve with Fiendfyre?”“Ha,” said Professor Quirrell, and gestured.The balefire phoenix moved forward in a rush of crimson terror, thered light casting writhing shadows on the remaining marble walls. Harryjumped back before he could think.The dreadful dark-red blaze rushed past Professor Quirrell, surgedinto the golden back of the Mirror, and disappeared as fast as it touchedthe gold.Then the fire was gone, and the room was tinged scarlet no more.There was no scratch upon the golden surface, no glow to mark theabsorption of heat. The Mirror had simply remained in place, untouched.Chills went down Harry’s spine. If he’d been playing Dungeons andDragons and the dungeon master had reported that result, Harry wouldhave suspected a mental illusion, and rolled to disbelieve.Upon the center of the golden back had appeared a sequence of runesin no known alphabet, black absences of light in small lines and curves,arranged in a level horizontal row. The thought occurred to Harry thatsome minor concealing illusion had been consumed in the Fiendfyre, afar lesser enchantment that had been added to prevent children from seeing those letters…“How old is this Mirror?” Harry said in almost a whisper.“Nobody knows, Mr. Potter.” The Defense Professor reached out hisfingers toward the runes, a look of something like reverence on his face;but his fingers did not touch the gold. “But my guess is the same as yours,I think. It is said, in certain legends that may or may not be fabrications,that this Mirror reflects itself perfectly and therefore its existence is absolutely stable. So stable that the Mirror was able to survive when everyother effect of Atlantis was undone, all its consequences severed fromTime. You can see why I was amused when you suggested Fiendfyre.”The Defense Professor let his hand fall.Even in the middle of everything else, Harry felt the awe, if that wastrue. The golden frame gleamed no brighter than before, for all the revelation; but you could imagine it going back, and back, into a civilizationthat had been made to never be… “What—does the Mirror do, exactly?”“An excellent question,” said Professor Quirrell. “The answer is in therunes that are written upon the Mirror’s golden back. Read them to me.”“They’re not in any alphabet I recognize. They look like randomly oriented chicken-scratches drawn by Tolkien elves.”“Read them anyway. Iss not dangerouss.”“The runes say, noitilov detalo partxe tnere hoc ruoy tu becafruoy ton wohsi—” Harry stopped, feeling more prickles at his spine.Harry knew what the rune for noitilov meant. It meant noitilov. Andthe next runes said to detalo the noitilov until it reached partxe, then1761 *keep the part that was both tnere and hoc. That belief felt like knowledge,like he could have answered ‘Yes’ with confident authority if somebodyasked him whether the ton wo was ruoy or becafruoy. It was just thatwhen Harry tried to relate those concepts to any other concepts, he drewa blank.“Do you undersstand what wordss mean, boy?”“Don't think sso.”Professor Quirrell gave a soft exhalation, his eyes not leaving thegolden frame. “I had wondered if perhaps the Words of False Comprehension might be understandable to a student of Muggle science.Apparently not.”“Maybe—” Harry began.Really, Ravenclaw? said Slytherin. You’re pulling this NOW?“Maybe I could try again to understand the words if I knew moreabout the Mirror?” said Harry’s Ravenclaw part, which had assumeddirect control.Professor Quirrell’s lips quirked up. “As with most ancient things,scholars have written down enough lies that it is hard to be sure of anything by now. It is definite that the Mirror is at least as old as Merlin,for it is known that Merlin used it as a tool. It is also known that afterhis death, Merlin left written instructions that the Mirror did not needto be sealed away, despite it having certain powers that might normallycause one to worry. He wrote that, given how painstakingly the Mirrorhad been crafted to not destroy the world, it would be easier to destroythe world using a lump of cheese.”This statement struck Harry as not entirely reassuring.“Certain other facts about the Mirror are attested by famous wizardswho were reasonably skeptical, and whose word has otherwise provenreliable. The Mirror’s most characteristic power is to create alternaterealms of existence, though these realms are only as large in size as whatcan be seen within the Mirror; it is known that people and other objectscan be stored therein. It is claimed by several authorities that the Mirroralone of all magics possesses a true moral orientation, though I am notsure what that could mean in practical terms. I would expect moralists tocall the Cruciatus Curse by their name of ‘evil’ and the Patronus Charmby their name of ‘good’; I cannot guess what a moralist would think wasany more moral than that. But it is claimed, for example, that phoenixescame into our world from a realm that was evoked inside this Mirror.”Words like Jeepers and what his parents would have termed inappropriate language were all running through Harry’s head, none very coherently, as he stared at the golden back of the Mirror.“I have wandered the world and encountered many stories that arenot often heard,” said Professor Quirrell. “Most of them seemed to me tobe lies, but a few had the ring of history rather than storytelling. Upon awall of metal in a place where no one had come for centuries, I found written the claim that some Atlanteans foresaw their world’s end, and soughtto forge a device of great power to avert the inevitable catastrophe. If thatdevice had been completed, the story claimed, it would have become anabsolutely stable existence that could withstand the channeling of unlimited magic in order to grant wishes. And also—this was said to be thevastly harder task—the device would somehow avert the inevitable catastrophes any sane person would expect to follow from that premise. Theaspect I found interesting was that, according to the tale writ upon thosemetal plates, the rest of Atlantis ignored this project and went upon theirways. It was sometimes praised as a noble public endeavor, but nearlyall other Atlanteans found more important things to do on any given daythan help. Even the Atlantean nobles ignored the prospect of somebodyother than themselves obtaining unchallengeable power, which a less experienced cynic might expect to catch their attention. With relatively little support, the tiny handful of would-be makers of this device labored under working conditions that were not so much dramatically arduous, aspointlessly annoying. Eventually time ran out and Atlantis was destroyedwith the device still far from complete. I recognise certain echoes of myown experience that one does not usually see invented in mere tales.” Atwist in the dry smile. “But perhaps that is merely my own preference forone tale among a hundred other legends. You perceive, however, the echoof Merlin’s statement about the Mirror’s creators shaping it to not destroythe world. Most importantly for our purposes, it may explain why the Mirror would have the previously unknown capability that Dumbledore orPerenelle seems to have evoked, of showing any person who steps beforeit an illusion of a world in which one of their desires has been fulfilled. Itis the sort of sensible precaution you can imagine someone building intoa wish-granting creation meant to not go horribly wrong.”“Wow,” Harry whispered, and meant it. This was Magic with a capitalM, the sort of Magic that appeared in So You Want To Be A Wizard, not justa collection of random physics-violating things you could do with a wand.Professor Quirrell gestured at the golden back. “The final propertyupon which most tales agree, is that whatever the unknown means ofcommanding the Mirror—of that Key there are no plausible accounts—the Mirror’s instructions cannot be shaped to react to individual people.So it is not possible for Perenelle to command this Mirror, ‘only give theStone to Perenelle’. Dumbledore cannot state, ‘Only give the Stone to onewho wishes to give it to Nicholas Flamel’. There is in the Mirror a blindness such as philosophers have attributed to ideal justice; it must treat allwho come before it by the same rule, whatever rule may be in force. Thus,there must be some rule for reaching the Stone’s hiding-place which anyone can invoke. And now you see why you, called the Boy-Who-Lived,shall implement whatever strategies the two of us devise. For it was saidthat this thing possesses a moral orientation, and it may have been givencommands reflecting the same. I am well aware that on conventionalterms you are said to be Good, just as I am said to be Evil.” Professor Quirrell smiled, rather darkly. “So as our first attempt—though not our last,rest assured-let us see what this Mirror makes of your attempt to retrievethe Stone in order to save the life of Hermione Granger and hundreds ofyour fellow students.”“And the first version of that plan,” said Harry, who was beginning tofinally understand, “the one you invented on Friday in my first week ofHogwarts, called for the Stone to be retrieved by Dumbledore’s goldenchild, the Boy-Who-Lived, making a selfless and noble attempt to savethe life of his dying Defense teacher, Professor Quirrell.”“Of course,” said Professor Quirrell.It was a poetical sort of plot, Harry supposed, but his appreciation ofthat elegance was being hampered by the surrounding circumstances.Then another thought occurred to Harry.“Um,” Harry said. “You think that this Mirror is a trap for you—”“There is no way beneath the heavens that it is not meant as a trap.”“That is to say, it’s a trap for Lord Voldemort. Only it can’t be a trap forhim personally. There has to be a general rule that underlies it, some generalizable quality of Lord Voldemort that triggers it.” Without consciousawareness, Harry was frowning hard at the Mirror’s golden back.“As you say,” said Professor Quirrell, who was beginning to frown atHarry’s frowning.“Well, on the first Thursday of this year, the mad Headmaster Dumbledore, who I’d just seen incinerate a chicken, told me that I had no chancewhatsoever of getting into his forbidden corridor, since I didn’t know thespell Alohomora.”“I see,” said Professor Quirrell. “Oh, dear. I wish you had thought tomention this to me a good deal earlier.”Neither of them needed to state aloud the obvious, that this bit of reverse reverse psychology had successfully ensured that Harry would staythe heck away from Dumbledore’s forbidden corridor.Harry was still concentrating. “Do you think Dumbledore suspectsthat I am, in his terms, a horcrux of Lord Voldemort, or more generally,that some aspects of my personality were copied off Lord Voldemort?”Even as Harry asked this aloud, he realized what a dumb question it was,and how much completely blatant evidence he’d already seen that—“Dumbledore cannot possibly have missed it,” said Professor Quirrell.“It is not exactly subtle. What else is Dumbledore to think, that you arean actor in a play whose stupid author has never met a real eleven-yearold? Only a gibbering dullard would believe that—ah, never mind.”The two of them stared at the Mirror in silence.Finally Professor Quirrell sighed. “I have outwitted myself, I fear. Neither you nor I dare be reflected in this Mirror. I suppose I must commandProfessor Sprout to undo my Obliviations of Mr. Nott and Miss Greengrass… You see, the other great difficulty of the Mirror is that the rule bywhich it treats those reflected will disregard external forces, such as FalseMemories or a Confundus Charm. The Mirror reflects only those forcesarising from within the person themselves, the states of mind they arriveat through their own choices; so it is said in several places. That is why Ihad Mr. Nott and Miss Greengrass, believing different stories about whythe Stone’s extraction was necessary, ready to appear before this Mirror.”Professor Quirrell rubbed at the bridge of his nose. “I constructed otherstories for other students, ready for me to set into motion with the chosen trigger… but as this day approached, I began to feel pessimistic aboutthe project. Such as Nott and Greengrass still seem worth trying, if wecannot think of something better. But I wonder if Dumbledore has triedto construct this puzzle to specifically resist Voldemort’s cunning. I wonder if he might have succeeded. If you devise an alternative plan which Iapprove enough to try, I promisse that whatever pawn I ssend forth sshall not beharmed by me, then or ever; nor do I expect to break that promisse. And I remindyou again of the hostages I hold to my failure, both Miss Granger and allthe others.”Again they stared at the mirror in silence, the elder Tom Riddle andthe younger.“I suspect, Professor,” Harry said after a time, “that your entire classof hypotheses about somebody needing to want the Stone for good or honest purposes is mistaken. The Headmaster wouldn’t set a retrieval rulelike that.”“Why?”“Because Dumbledore knows how easy it is to end up believing thatyou’re doing the right thing when you’re actually not. It’d be the first possibility he imagined.”“Iss it truth or trickery that I hear?”“Am being honesst,” Harry said.Professor Quirrell nodded. “Then your point is well taken.”“I’m not sure why you think this puzzle is solvable,” Harry said. “Justset a rule like, your left hand must hold a small blue pyramid and twolarge red pyramids, and your right hand must be squeezing mayonnaiseonto a hamster—”“No,” Professor Quirrell said. “No, I think not. The legends are unclear on what rules can be given, but I think it must have something to dowith the Mirror’s original intended use—it must have something to dowith the deep desires and wishes arising from within the person. Squeezing mayonnaise onto a hamster will not qualify as that, for most people.”“Huh,” Harry said. “Maybe the rule is that the person has to not wantto use the Stone at all—no, that’s too easy, the story you gave Mr. Nottsolves it.”“In some ways you may understand Dumbledore better than I,” saidProfessor Quirrell. “So now I ask you this: how would Dumbledore usehis notion of the acceptance of death to guard this Stone? For that aboveall he thinks I cannot comprehend, and he is not far wrong.”Harry thought about this for a while, considering several ideas anddiscarding them. And then, having thought of something, Harry considered remaining silent… before mapping out the obvious part of the futureconversation where Professor Quirrell asked him to say in Parseltongueif he’d thought of something.Reluctantly, Harry spoke. “Would Dumbledore think that this Mirrorcould reach the afterlife? Could he put the Stone into something that hethinks is an afterlife, so that only people who believe in an afterlife can seeit?”“Hm…” Professor Quirrell said. “Possibly… yes, there is a certain plausibility to it. Using this setting of the Mirror to show people their heart’sdesires… Albus Dumbledore would see himself reunited with his family.He would see himself united with them in death, wanting to die himselfrather than wishing for them to be returned to life. His brother Aberforth,his sister Ariana, his parents Kendra and Percival… it would be Aberforthto whom Dumbledore gave the Stone, I think. Would the Mirror recognize that Aberforth particularly had been given the Stone? Or will any person’s dead relative do, if that person believes their relative’s spirit wouldgive them back the Stone?” Professor Quirrell was pacing in a short circle,keeping well away from Harry and the Mirror as he moved. “But all thisis only one idea. Let us devise another.”Harry began to tap his cheek, then stopped abruptly as he realizedwhere he’d picked up that gesture. “What if Perenelle is the one who putthe Stone in here? Maybe she keyed the Mirror to give the Stone only tothe person who put it in originally.”“Perenelle has lived this long by knowing her limitations,” said Professor Quirrell. “She does not overestimate her own intellect, she is notprideful, if that were so she would have lost the Stone long ago. Perenellewill not try to think of a good Mirror-rule herself, not when Master Flamelcan leave the matter in Dumbledore’s wiser hands… but the rule of onlyreturning the Stone to the one who remembers placing it, also works ifDumbledore himself has placed the Stone. It would be a hard rule to bypass, since I cannot simply Confund someone into believing that they putin the Stone… I would have to create a false Stone, and a false Mirror, andarrange the drama…” Professor Quirrell was frowning, now. “But it is stillsomething that Dumbledore would imagine Voldemort being able to arrange, given time. If at all possible, Dumbledore will want to make thekey to the Mirror a state of mind he thinks I cannot arrange in a pawn—or a rule that Dumbledore thinks Voldemort can never comprehend, suchas a rule involving the acceptance of one’s own death. That is why I considered your previous idea plausible.”Then Harry had an idea.He was not sure if it was a good idea.…it wasn’t like Harry had a lot of choice here.“Arguendo,” Harry said. “We’re not sure what’s necessary to retrievethe Stone. But a sufficient condition should involve Albus Dumbledore, ormaybe someone else, in a state of mind where they believe that the DarkLord has been defeated, that the threat is over, and that it is time to takeout the Stone and give it back to Nicholas Flamel. We aren’t sure whichpart of that person’s state of mind, let’s say Dumbledore’s, will be the necessary part that he thinks Lord Voldemort can’t understand or duplicate;but under those conditions Dumbledore’s entire state of mind will be sufficient.”“Reasonable,” said Professor Quirrell. “So?”“The corresponding strategy,” Harry said carefully, “is to mimic Dumbledore’s state of mind under those conditions, in as much detail as possible, while standing in front of the mirror. And this state of mind musthave been produced by internal forces, not external ones.”“But how are we to get that without Legilimency or the ConfundusCharm, both of which would certainly be external—ha. I see.” ProfessorQuirrell’s ice-pale eyes were suddenly piercing. “You suggest that I Confund myself, as you cast that hex upon yourself during your first day inBattle Magic. So that it is an internal force and not an external one, astate of mind that comes about through only my own choices. Say to mewhether you have made this suggestion with the intention of trappingme, boy. Say it to me in Parseltongue.”“My mind that you assked to devisse sstrategy may perhapss have been influencedby ssuch an intent—who knowss? Knew you would be ssusspiciouss, assk thiss veryquestion. Decission is up to you, teacher. I know nothing you do not know, aboutwhether thiss iss likely to trap you. Do not call it betrayal by me if you choosse thiss foryoursself, and it failss.” Harry felt a strong impulse to smile, and suppressedit.“Lovely,” said Professor Quirrell, who was smiling. “I suppose thereare some threats from an inventive mind that even questioning in Parseltongue cannot neutralize.”Harry put on the Cloak of Invisibility, at Professor Quirrell’s orders, tosstop the man who sshall believe himsself to be sschoolmasster from sseeing you, asProfessor Quirrell said in Parseltongue.“Wearing the Cloak or no, you will stand in range of the Mirror yourself,” Professor Quirrell said. “If a gush of lava comes forth, you will alsoburn. I feel that much symmetry should apply.”Professor Quirrell pointed to a spot near the right of the door throughwhich they’d entered the room, before the Mirror and well back of it.Harry, wearing the Cloak, went to where Professor Quirrell had pointedhim, and did not argue. It was increasingly unclear to Harry whetherboth Riddles dying here would be a bad thing, even with hundredsof other student hostages at stake. For all of Harry’s good intentions,he’d mostly shown himself so far to be an idiot, and the returned LordVoldemort was a threat to the entire world.(Though either way, Harry couldn’t see Dumbledore doing the lavathing. Dumbledore was probably sufficiently angry at Voldemort to discard his usual restraint, but lava wouldn’t permanently stop an entity thatDumbledore believed to be a discorporate soul.)Then Professor Quirrell pointed with his wand, and a shimmering circle appeared around where Harry was standing on the floor. This, Professor Quirrell said, would soon become a Greater Circle of Concealment, bywhich nothing within that circle could be heard or seen from the outside.Harry would not be able to make himself apparent to the false Dumbledore by taking off the Cloak, nor by shouting.“You will not cross this circle once it is active,” Professor Quirrell said.“That would cause you to touch my magic, and while Confunded I mightnot remember how to halt the resonance that would destroy us both. Andfurther, since I do not want you throwing shoes—” Professor Quirrellmade another gesture, and just within the Greater Circle of Concealment,a slight shimmer appeared in the air, a globe-shaped distortion. “Thiss barrier will explode if touched, by you or other material thing. The resonance mightlash at me afterward, but you would also be dead. Now tell me in Parseltongue that you do not intend to cross this circle or take off your Cloakor do anything at all impulsive or stupid. Tell you me you will wait quietlyhere, under the Cloak, until this is over.”This Harry repeated back.Then Professor Quirrell’s robes became black tinged with gold, suchrobes as Dumbledore might wear upon a formal occasion; and ProfessorQuirrell pointed his own wand at his head.Professor Quirrell stayed motionless for a long time, still holding hiswand to his head. His eyes were closed in concentration.And then Professor Quirrell said, “Confundus.”At once the expression of the man standing there changed; he blinkeda few times as though confused, lowering his wand.A deep weariness spread over the face Professor Quirrell had worn;without any visible change his eyes seemed older, the few lines in his facecalling attention to themselves.His lips were set in a sad smile.Without any hurry, the man quietly walked over to the Mirror, asthough he had all the time in the world.He crossed into the Mirror’s range of reflection without anything happening, and stared into the surface.What the man might be seeing there, Harry could not tell; to Harryit seemed that the flat, perfect surface still reflected the room behind it,like a portal to another place.“Ariana,” breathed the man. “Mother, father. And you, my brother, itis done.”The man stood still, as if listening.“Yes, done,” the man said. “Voldemort came before this mirror, andwas trapped by Merlin’s method. He is only one more sealed horror now.”Again the listening stillness.“I would that I could obey you, my brother, but it is better this way.”The man bowed his head. “He is denied his death, forever; that vengeanceis terrible enough.”Harry felt a twinge, watching this, a sense that this was not whatDumbledore would have said, it seemed more like a strawman, a shallow stereotype… but then this wasn’t the real Aberforth’s spirit either,this was who Professor Quirrell imagined Dumbledore imagined Aberforth was, and that doubly-reflected image of Aberforth wouldn’t noticeanything amiss…“It is time to give back the Philosopher’s Stone,” said the man whothought he was Dumbledore. “It must go back into Master Flamel’s keeping, now.”Listening stillness.“No,” said the man, “Master Flamel has kept it safe these many yearsfrom all who would seek immortality, and I think it will be safest in hishands… no, Aberforth, I do think his intentions are good.”Harry couldn’t control the tension that was running through himlike a live wire; he was having trouble breathing. Imperfect, ProfessorQuirrell’s Confundus Charm had been imperfect. The underlying personality of Professor Quirrell was leaking through and seeing the obviousquestion, why it was okay for Nicholas Flamel himself to have the Stoneif immortality was so awful. Even if Professor Quirrell conceptualizedDumbledore as being blind to the question, Professor Quirrell hadn’tincluded a clause in the Confundus saying that Dumbledore’s image ofAberforth wouldn’t think of it; and all of this was ultimately a reflection of1771 *Professor Quirrell’s own mind, an image from within the intelligence ofTom Riddle…“Destroy it?” said the man. “Maybe. I am not sure it can be destroyed,or Master Flamel would have done it long since. I think, many times, thathe has regretted making it… Aberforth, I promised him, and we are not soancient or so wise ourselves. The Philosopher’s Stone must go back intothe keeping of the one who made it.”And Harry’s breath stopped.The man was holding an irregular chunk of scarlet glass in his lefthand, the size perhaps of Harry’s thumb from fingernail to the first joint.The sheened surface of the scarlet glass made it seem wet; the appearancewas of blood, suspended in time and made into a jagged surface.“Thank you, my brother,” the man said quietly.Is that what the Stone should look like? Does Professor Quirrell know whatthe true Stone should look like? Will the Mirror give back the real Stone underthese conditions, or make an imitation and return that?And then—“No, Ariana,” the man said, smiling gently, “I fear I must go now. Bepatient, my dearest, it will be soon enough that I join you in truth… why?Why, I am not sure why I must go… when I hold the Stone I am to stepaside from the Mirror and wait for Master Flamel to contact me, but I amnot sure why I need to step aside from the Mirror to do that…” The mansighed. “Ah, I am getting old. It is well this dreadful war ended when itdid. I suppose there is no harm if I speak to you for a time, my dearest, ifyou wish it so.”A headache was starting behind Harry’s eyes; some part of Harry wastrying to send a message about not having breathed in a while, but noone was listening. Imperfect, Professor Quirrell’s Confundus Charm hadbeen imperfect, Professor Quirrell’s image of Dumbledore’s image of Ariana wanted to talk to Dumbledore, and maybe didn’t want to wait because Professor Quirrell knew on some level that there wasn’t really anafterlife, and the previously implanted impulse to leave after getting theStone wasn’t standing up to Riddle-Ariana’s arguments…And then Harry felt himself become very calm. He started breathingagain.Either way, there wasn’t much Harry could do about it. ProfessorQuirrell had stopped Harry from intervening; well, Professor Quirrellwas welcome to reap the consequences of that decision. If the consequences caught Harry as well, so be it.The man who thought he was Dumbledore was mostly nodding patiently, sometimes replying to his dearest sister. Sometimes the man castan uneasy look to one side; as if feeling a strong impulse to go, but suppressing that impulse with the great patience and politeness and concernfor his sister that Professor Quirrell imagined Albus Dumbledore having.Harry saw it the instant the Confundus wore off, and the man’s expression changed, becoming again the face of Professor Quirrell.And in the same instant the Mirror changed, no longer showing Harrythe reflection of the room, showing instead the form of the real AlbusDumbledore, as though he were standing just behind the Mirror and visible through it.The real Dumbledore’s face was set, and grim.“Hello, Tom,” said Albus Dumbledore.on Albus Dumbledore’s face lasted only an instant beTheforegrimnessgiving way to bewilderment. “Quirinus? What—”And then there was a pause.“Well,” said Albus Dumbledore. “I do feel stupid.”“I should hope so,” Professor Quirrell said easily; if he had been at allshocked himself at being caught, it did not show. A casual wave of hishand changed his robes back to a Professor’s clothing.Dumbledore’s grimness had returned and redoubled. “There I am,searching so hard for Voldemort’s shade, never noticing that the DefenseProfessor of Hogwarts is a sickly, half-dead victim possessed by a spiritfar more powerful than himself. I would call it senility, if so many othershad not missed it as well.”“Quite,” said Professor Quirrell. He lifted his eyebrows. “Really, am Ithat hard to recognise without the glowing red eyes?”“Oh, yes indeed,” Albus Dumbledore said in level tones. “Your acting was perfect; I confess myself utterly deceived. Quirinus Quirrellseemed—what is the term I am looking for? Ah yes, that is the word. Heseemed sane.”Professor Quirrell chuckled; he looked for all the world as though thetwo of them were just having a casual conversation. “I never was insane,you know. Lord Voldemort was just another game for me, the same asProfessor Quirrell.”Albus Dumbledore did not look like he was enjoying a casual chat. “Ithought you might say that. I regret to inform you, Tom, that anyone whocan bring himself to act the part of Voldemort is Voldemort.”“Ah,” said Professor Quirrell, raising an admonishing finger. “Thereis a loophole in that reasoning, old man. Anyone who acts the part ofVoldemort must be what moralists call ‘evil’, on this we agree. But perhaps the real me is completely, utterly, irredeemably evil in an interestingly different fashion from what I was pretending with Voldemort—”“I find,” Albus Dumbledore ground out, “that I do not care.”“Then you must think yourself to be rid of me very soon,” said Professor Quirrell. “How interesting. My immortal existence must depend ondiscovering what trap you have set, and finding a way to escape from it,as soon as possible.” Professor Quirrell paused. “But let us pointlessly delay to talk of other matters first. How did you come to be waiting insidethe Mirror? I thought you would be elsewhere.”“I am there,” Albus Dumbledore said, “and also inside the Mirror, unfortunately for you. I have always been here, all along.”“Ah,” said Professor Quirrell, and sighed. “I suppose my little distraction was for naught, then.”And the rage of Albus Dumbledore was no longer leashed. “Distraction?” roared Dumbledore, his sapphire eyes tight with fury. “You killedMaster Flamel for a distraction?”Professor Quirrell looked dismayed. “I am wounded by the injusticeof your accusation. I did not kill the one you know as Flamel. I simplycommanded another to do so.”“How could you? Even you, how could you? He was the library of all our lore!Secrets you have forever lost to wizardry!”There was an edge to Professor Quirrell’s smile, now. “You know, Istill do not comprehend how your twisted mind can consider it acceptable for Flamel to be immortal, but when I try for the same it makes me amonster.”“Master Flamel never descended into immortality! He—” Dumbledorechoked. “He only stayed awake past his evening, for our sakes, throughhis long, long day—”“I don’t know if you recall this,” Professor Quirrell said, his voice airy,“but do you recall that day in your office with Tom Riddle? The one whereI begged you, where I went down on my knees and begged you, to introduce me to Nicholas Flamel so that I could ask to become his apprentice,to someday make for myself the Philosopher’s Stone? That was my lastattempt to be a good person, if you are curious. You told me no, and gaveme a lecture on how unvirtuous it was to be afraid of death. I went fromyour office in bitterness and in fury. I reasoned that if I was to be calledevil in any case, just for not wanting to die, then I might as well be evil;and one month later I killed Abigail Myrtle to pursue immortality by othermeans. Even when I knew more of Flamel, I remained quite put out withyour hypocrisy; and for that reason I tormented you and yours more thanI otherwise would have done. I have often felt that you ought to know this,but we never had a chance to talk frankly.”“I decline,” said Albus Dumbledore, whose gaze did not waver. “I donot accept the tiniest shred of responsibility for what you have become.That was all, entirely, you and your own decisions.”“I am not surprised to hear you say that,” said Professor Quirrell.“Well, now I am curious as to what responsibilities you do accept. Youhave access to some unusual power of Divination; that much I deducedlong ago. You made too many nonsensical moves, and the paths bywhich they worked out in your favor were too ridiculous. So tell me.Were you forewarned of the result, that night of All Hallow’s Eve when Iwas vanquished for a time?”“I knew,” said Albus Dumbledore, his voice low and cold. “For that, Iaccept responsibility, which is something you will never understand.”“You arranged for Severus Snape to hear the Prophecy that he broughtto me.”“I allowed it to happen,” said Albus Dumbledore.“And there I was, all excited at having finally gained my own foreknowledge.” Professor Quirrell shook his head as though in sadness.“So the great hero Dumbledore sacrificed his unwitting pawns, Lily andJames Potter, merely to banish me for a few years.”Albus Dumbledore’s eyes were like stones. “James and Lily would havegone willingly to the death, if they had known.”“And the little baby?” Professor Quirrell said. “Somehow I doubt thePotters would have been so eager to leave him in the path of You-KnowWho.”You could scarcely see the flinch. “The Boy-Who-Lived came out ofit well enough. Tried to turn him into you, did you? Instead you turnedyourself into a corpse, and Harry Potter became the wizard you shouldhave been.” Now there was something like the usual Dumbledore behindthe half-moon glasses, a tiny twinkle in those eyes. “All of Tom Riddle’sicy brilliance, tamed to the service of James and Lily’s warmth and love. Iwonder how you felt when you saw what Tom Riddle could have become,if he had grown up in a loving family?”Professor Quirrell’s lips quirked. “I was surprised, even shocked, bythe abyssal depths of Mr. Potter’s naivete.”“I suppose the humor of the situation would be lost on you.” It wasthen, finally, that Albus Dumbledore smiled. “How I laughed when I realised it! When I saw you had made a Good Voldemort to oppose the evilone—ah, how I laughed! I never had the steel for my role, but Harry Potter shall be more than equal to it, when he comes into his power.” AlbusDumbledore’s smile disappeared. “Though I suppose Harry shall have tofind some other Dark Lord to vanquish for it, since you will not be there.”“Ah, yes. That.” Professor Quirrell made to walk away from the Mirrror, and seemed to halt just before reaching the point where the Mirrorwould no longer have reflected him, if it had been reflecting him. “Interesting.”Dumbledore’s smile was colder, now. “No, Tom. You are not goinganywhere.”Professor Quirrell nodded. “What have you done, exactly?”“You have refused death,” said Dumbledore, “and if I destroyed yourbody, your spirit would only wander back, like a dumb animal that cannotunderstand it is being sent away. So I am sending you outside Time, toa frozen instant from which neither I nor any other can return you. Perhaps Harry Potter will be able to retrieve you someday, if prophecy speakstrue. He may wish to discuss with you just who is at fault for the deathsof his parents. For you it will only be an instant—if you ever return at all.Either way, Tom, I wish you the best of it.”“Hm,” said Professor Quirrell. The Defense Professor had paced pastwhere Harry stood, watching mute and with something like horror, onlyto halt again at the other edge of the mirror. “As I suspected. You areusing Merlin’s old method of sealing, what the tale of Topherius Changnames as the Process of the Timeless. If legend speaks true, not even youcan stop the process, now that it has been in motion this long.”“Indeed,” said Albus Dumbledore. But his eyes were suddenly wary.And Harry, from where he stood just before and to the right of thedoor, waiting in silence and controlled terror, could feel it in the air; hecould feel the sense of a presence gathering within the Mirror’s field. Something more alien than magic, everything about it incomprehensible except for the fact of its strangeness and the fact of its power. It had beenslow but now it was waxing faster, that presence.“But you could still reverse the effect, if Chang’s account is true,” saidProfessor Quirrell. “Most powers of the Mirror are double-sided, according to legend. So you could banish what is on the other side of the Mirrorinstead. Send yourself, instead of me, into that frozen instant. If youwanted to, that is.”“And why would I do that?” Albus Dumbledore’s voice was tight. “Isuppose you are going to tell me that you have taken hostages? That wasfutile, Tom, you fool! You utter fool! You should have known that I wouldgive you nothing for any hostages you had taken.”“You always were one step too slow,” said Professor Quirrell. “Allowme to introduce you to my hostage.”Another presence invaded the air around Harry, a crawling sensationall over his flesh as another Tom Riddle’s magic passed very close to hisskin. The Cloak of Invisibility was torn away from him, and the shimmering black Cloak flew away from him, through the air.Professor Quirrell caught it, and swiftly drew it over himself; in lessthan a second he had pulled down the Cloak’s hood over his head, anddisappeared.Albus Dumbledore staggered, as though some essential support hadbeen removed from him.“Harry Potter,” the Headmaster breathed. “What are you doing here?”Harry stared at the image of Albus Dumbledore, on whose face uttershock and utter dismay were warring.The guilt and the shame were too much, too much, hitting Harry all atonce, and he could feel the incomprehensible presence around him risingto a peak. Harry knew without words that there was no time left, and thathe was done.“It’s my fault,” Harry said in a tiny voice, from whatever part of himhad taken over his throat in the final extremity. “I was stupid. I’ve alwaysbeen stupid. You mustn’t rescue me. Goodbye.”“Why, look at that,” sang out Professor Quirrell’s voice from the emptyair, “I don’t seem to have a reflection any more.”“No,” said Albus Dumbledore. “No, no, NO!”Into the hand of the Albus Dumbledore flew from his sleeve hislong, dark-grey wand, and in his other hand, as though from nowhere,appeared a short rod of dark stone.Albus Dumbledore threw these both violently aside, just as the building sense of power rose to an unbearable peak, and then disappeared.The Mirror returned to showing the ordinary reflection of a gold-litroom of white stone, without any trace of where Albus Dumbledore hadbeen.he Dark Lord was laughing.From the empty air came the voice of the Defense Professorlaughing wildly, so high and terrible his laughter; it was Voldemort’slaughter now, the Dark Lord’s laughter beyond all hiding or restraint.Harry’s mind was disarrayed. His eyes kept staring at where AlbusDumbledore had been. There was a horror in him that was too huge forunderstanding or reflection. His mind kept trying to fall back throughtime and undo reality, but that wasn’t a sort of magic that existed, andreality stayed the same.He had lost, he had lost Dumbledore, there were no take-backs, andthat meant he had lost the war.And the Dark Lord went on laughing.“Ah, ah hah, ah hah hah ha! Professor Dumbledore, ah, ProfessorDumbledore, such a fitting end to our game!” Another burst of wild laughter. “The wrong sacrifice even at the finish, for the piece you gave up everything to save was already in my possession! The wrong trap even fromthe beginning, for I could have abandoned this body at any time! Ah, hahahahaha, aha! You never did learn cunning, you poor old fool.”“You—” A voice was coming from Harry’s throat. “You—”“Ahahahaha! Why, yes, little child, you were always along on this adventure as my hostage, it was your whole purpose in being here. Ha, hahahaha! You are decades too young to play this game against the realTom Riddle, child.” The Dark Lord drew back the hood of the Cloak, hishead becoming visible, and began to remove the rest of the Cloak. “Andnow, boy, you have helped me, yess indeed, and so it iss time to ressurrect your girlchild friend. To keep promisse.” The Dark Lord’s smile was cold, cold indeed.1781 *“I suppose you have doubts? Mark well, I could kill you this instant, forthere is no longer a Headmaster of Hogwarts to be informed of it. Doubtme all you wish, but remember that.” The hand was once more holdingthe gun. “Now come along, foolish child.”And they left.They went back out through the door into the Potions room, the DarkLord banishing the returned purple fire with a stroke of his wand. Theywent through the chamber where the boggart had been, and the chamberof ruined chess statues, and through the burned door of the chamber ofkeys. The Dark Lord floated up through the trapdoor, and Harry struggled up afterward through the spiral staircase of leaves, the tendrils ofthe Devil’s Snare twitching and then moving back as though afraid. TheBoy-Who-Lived was trying hard not to burst into tears, and his dark-sidepatterns weren’t helping, maybe because Voldemort had never known ordealt with guilt.They passed the huge three-headed Inferi, and at a whispered wordfrom the Dark Lord it collapsed over the trapdoor and became a corpseagain.They passed Severus Snape standing guard, who told them both thathe was guarding the door, and that they must leave or he would deductHouse points.The Dark Lord spoke the words “Hyakuju montauk” without pausingin his stride, accompanied by a jab of his wand; and Severus staggeredbefore he lifelessly drew himself up beside the door once more.“What—” Harry said, as he followed. “What did you—”“Just fulfilling my obligation to my faithful servant. It shall not killhim, as I promised you.” The Dark Lord laughed again.“The hostages—” Harry said. It was hard to keep his voice steady. “Thestudents, you said you’d stop whatever is going to kill them—”“Yess. Sstop worrying. Will do on our way out.”“Out?”“We are leaving, child.” The Dark Lord was still smiling.The bad feeling this raised was lost in a sea of other bad feelings.The Dark Lord was now consulting what he’d called the HogwartsMap, the handwritten lines upon it seeming to move as they walked.Some part of Harry’s mind that had been considering what to do if theyran into Aurors on patrol (whom the Dark Lord could kill, or Obliviate, inan instant) gave up that hope as well.They went down the Grand Staircase to the second floor, encountering no one.The Dark Lord made a turn Harry did not know, and went down another stair-flight. As they descended past one floor and another, the windows stopped and the torches began, they were within the Slytherin dungeons now.Ahead, the form of a person in Hogwarts robes appeared.The Dark Lord kept walking toward that person.Harry followed.A sixth or seventh-year Slytherin was waiting by a section of wall thatwas set with an artistic carving of Salazar Slytherin wielding his wand,against what looked like a giant covered in icicles. The witch made nocomment at seeing Professor Quirrell walking upright, or seeing Harryin his company, or seeing the gun in the Defense Professor’s hand. If hereyes were blank, Harry couldn’t tell the difference.The Dark Lord reached into his robes, took out a Knut, and flipped itto her. “Klaudia Alicja Tabor, I command you thus. Take this Knut to thespell circle I showed you beneath the Quidditch stands and put it in thecenter. Then Obliviate yourself of the last six hours.”“Yes, lord,” the witch said, bowing to him, and went on her way.“I thought—” Harry said. “I thought you needed the Stone to—”The Dark Lord was still smiling, he had never stopped smiling. “I didnot say that part in Parseltongue, child. All I said in Parseltongue wasthat I had set events in motion to kill students, events that I would stopif I obtained the Stone. The rest was in human speech. I would also havestopped the Blood Fort sacrifice if I had not obtained the Stone, so longas I was not discovered and restrained. The students of Hogwarts are avaluable resource, whom I have already spent much time training.” Thenthe Dark Lord hissed to the wall, “Open.”Harry’s eyes saw the tiny snake that had been set in the upper-left ofthe carving, even as the wall slowly swung backward, revealing the open* 1783 *ing of a huge pipe. Moss grew on its sides and a musty dusty smell welledup from it; the interior was also covered with cobwebs in multiple sheets.“Spiders…” murmured the Dark Lord. He sighed, and for that briefmoment he sounded once more like Professor Quirrell.The Dark Lord walked into the huge pipe, the cobwebs burning awaybefore him. Harry, not seeing any other better options, followed.The pipe branched in a Y-shape, then branched again. The Dark Lordwent left, then right.The pipe came to a solid metal wall. “Open,” the Dark Lord hissed, anda crack appeared in the metal; it seemed to fold into itself.Beyond was the middle of a long, stone tunnel.“We shall be walking a while,” said the Dark Lord. “Did you have morequestions to ask, little child?”“I—I can’t think of any—right now—”Another cold laugh replied to this, and they walked into the tunnel,turning right.Harry didn’t know, then or ever, how long he walked; the light of burning spiderwebs was too dim to read his mechanical watch, and Harry hadnot thought to look at the time before entering. It felt like they walked formiles, miles beneath the ground.Slowly, Harry’s mind tried to recover itself a final time. Very possibly final, if he was right about the Dark Lord killing him after this…though the Dark Lord had said that he would resurrect Hermione, whichseemed pointless if that was true… was that simply the Dark Lord following through on a promise he would not otherwise have been able to makein Parseltongue… why had he not just shot Harry on the spot…Seriously, some last functioning part of his brain said to all the otherparts, this would be a good time to think of something, something that the DarkLord has not already thought of, something we can do without our pouch or ourwand or our Time-Turner, something that Professor Quirrell has not imagined wecan do… think, think, pretty pretty please think of something? Don’t shut downnow, even if you’re scared, even if we’ve never really really faced death before inthe sense of being about to die in the next hour, THIS IS NOT THE TIME TOHarry’s mind stayed blank.Suppose, said that last remaining part, suppose we try to condition on thefact that we win this, or at least get out of this alive. If someone TOLD YOU ASA FACT that you had survived, or even won, somehow made everything turn outokay, what would you think had happened—Not legitimate procedure, whispered Ravenclaw, the universe doesn’t worklike that, we’re just going to die.Someone realises we’re missing, thought Hufflepuff, and Mad-Eye Moodyshows up with a squad of Aurors and rescues us. I think the time has come to admitwe’re not more competent than the standard authorities.The saving factor does have to be something we do somehow, said the lastvoice. Otherwise there’s no point in our thinking about it.Problem two, said Gryffindor. Harry Potter isn’t missing, he’s right thereat the Quidditch match where everyone can see him. Professor Quirrell thought ofthat too, it’s part of why he sent that fake note. Problem three. I don’t think MadEye Moody and an Auror squad can beat the Dark Lord, and certainly not beforehe kills us. I’m not sure the entire DMLE can beat the Dark Lord if he’s fightingseriously and Dumbledore is gone. Problem four. The Quidditch match was notdisrupted, that’s probably the only reason why Professor Quirrell was willing totry something as complicated as bringing us along on this trip in the first place.Thinking along different lines, ventured Slytherin, maybe Professor Quirrell calls in someone else to Memory-Charm us. Legilimency, Imperius, Confundus, who knows what else, we’re not a perfect Occlumens. Then the Dark Lordwould have a smart—well, sort-of smart lieutenant that he could use. That couldbe another reason why Professor Quirrell was so willing to tell us secrets, if he knewthat the memory would disappear. It’s also a reason to leave the Hogwarts wards,so the Dark Lord can call Bellatrix to Apparate in and do the work…This entire reasoning process is illegitimate and I refuse to participate, saidRavenclaw.What lovely last words, said the last voice. Now shut up and think.Rough stone tunnel went by underfoot, Harry’s shoes sometimes dipping into moisture or nearly slipping on a curved surface. The neuronsin his brain, which kept on firing, imagined voices talking to each other,yelling at each other, even as the Listener stayed numb with horror andshame.Gryffindor and Hufflepuff were conducting a debate about suicide bycharging the Dark Lord’s gun, or by swallowing the little jewel on Harry’ssteel ring. It seemed unclear whether the fate of the world was better orworse if the Dark Lord had Harry as a mind-slave; if the Dark Lord wasgoing to win anyway, it might be better if he won faster.And the last voice kept talking through it all; even in the depths offailure that last voice remained. What else did the Dark Lord always say inhuman speech and never in Parseltongue? Do we remember? Anything like that,anything at all?It was all too distant in time, too distant in time even though it hadall happened this very day. The Dark Lord had told him in Parseltonguejust now that it was time to revive Hermione, and then he’d said otherthings all in English, Harry could hardly remember for all that they’d justbeen spoken. Before then… before then there’d been the Circle of Concealment, when Professor Quirrell had hissed that the barrier would explodeif touched. And the Defense Professor had said in English for Harry notto take off his Cloak or try crossing the Circle, said in English that theresonance might strike Professor Quirrell afterwards but Harry wouldbe dead. Said in English that if Harry touched the magic and ProfessorQuirrell didn’t remember how to halt the resonance, it would kill themboth…Suppose it doesn’t kill us both, said the last voice. On Halloween in Godric’sHollow, the Dark Lord’s body was burned and we only ended up with a scar on ourforehead. Suppose the resonance between us is deadlier to the Dark Lord than tous. What if this entire time we’ve been able to kill the Dark Lord at any time, justby dashing forward and touching our hands to any part of his exposed skin? Andthen it makes our scar bleed again, but that’s all. The sense of ‘stop, don’t do that’is inherited from the Dark Lord’s worst memory of his mistake in Godric’s Hollow,it may not actually apply to the Boy-Who-Lived.A small note of hope rose.Rose, and was quashed.The Dark Lord can just throw away his wand, droned Ravenclaw. Professor Quirrell can turn into his Animagus form. Even if he dies the Dark Lord willpossess someone else and return, and then torture our parents, to punish us.We might be able to get to our parents in time, said the last voice. We mightbe able to hide them. We might be able to get the Philosopher’s Stone away fromthe Dark Lord if we killed his current body now, and that Stone could provide thenucleus of a counter-army.The Dark Lord was moving on through the stony corridor. His handstill held the gun. He was at least four meters away from Harry.If we dart forward, he will sense us approaching through the resonance, saidHufflepuff. He will fly forward rapidly, he can do that, he has the broomstickenchantments that let him fly. He will fly forward, turn around, and fire the gun.He knows about the resonance, he’s thought of this already. This is not somethingthe Dark Lord has failed to consider. He will be ready for it, and waiting.Continuing the same line of argument, said the last voice. Suppose we canfreely cast magic on Professor Quirrell but he can’t cast it on us.Why would that be true? demanded Ravenclaw. In fact, we have evidencethat it’s false. In Azkaban, when Professor Quirrell’s Avada Kedavra hit our Patronus Charm, it felt like our head was splitting apart—Suppose that was all his magic going out of control. Suppose if we’d just cast,say, a Luminos targeting him, nothing bad would have happened.But why? said Ravenclaw. Why suppose that?Because, thought Harry, it explains why Professor Quirrell didn’t warn menot to cast any magic on him in Azkaban. Because Professor Quirrell never saidin Parseltongue, that I can remember, that I’d hurt myself if I tried to cast magicon him. He could have given me that warning, but he didn’t, even though he gaveme a lot of other warnings. Absence of evidence is weak evidence of absence.There was a pause while Harry’s parts considered this.We don’t actually have our wand, said Ravenclaw.We might get it back at some point, thought the last voice.But even then, Harry thought, and the grey hopelessness returned, theresonance is something the Dark Lord knows about. He’s already thought of everything I can do with that, he already has a response prepared. That was mymistake from the beginning. I didn’t respect the Dark Lord’s intelligence, I didn’tthink that maybe he knew everything I knew and could see everything I saw andhad already taken it into account.Then, said the last voice, conditional on our winning, we must have hit himwith something he doesn’t know about.Dementors, offered Gryffindor.The Dark Lord knows we can destroy, deflect, and possibly control Dementors,said Ravenclaw. He doesn’t know how, but he knows we have the capability, andwhere the heck would we get a Dementor anyway?Maybe, ventured Hufflepuff, the Dark Lord’s whole horcrux system wouldshort out via the resonance if we grabbed him and held him, sacrificing our ownlife to destroy him forever.Bullhockey, said Ravenclaw. But I guess it doesn’t hurt to engage in somepleasant fantasy before we die, no matter how stupid.If Lord Voldemort had a strong enough fear of death, Hufflepuff argued, ifhe wanted strongly enough to just not need to think about death again, then thehorcrux system could have design flaws like that. It never occurred to Voldemortto test his horcruxes on someone else, that could indicate he wasn’t able to thinkabout the subject clearly—So his fear of death is his fatal weakness? said Ravenclaw. Yeah, no. I’mthinking someone with over a hundred horcruxes might have a few failsafe mechanisms in there.And Harry’s brain went on thinking.A genuine asymmetry in the magical resonance between them…seemed improbable, there was no reason for the magical effect to worklike that. But the magical backlash could hit the stronger wizard harder,the more powerful magic resonating more dangerously. That couldexplain the observed event in Godric’s Hollow (Voldemort explodes, babysurvives), and also explain the observed event in Azkaban (Voldemortseverely impaired by backlash of his strong magic, first-year Boy-WhoLived hit by lighter backlash of his weak magic). Or if it was only thecaster’s magic that resonated, that could also explain both those two observations. That might even explain why Professor Quirrell had been inno rush to warn Harry against casting any magic on him. Though therewas another obvious reason why Professor Quirrell would avoid raisingthe subject of the resonance; it was a gigantic hint about the mystery ofGodric’s Hollow, if Harry had ever made the connection.The part that was numb with grief and guilt took this opportunityto observe, speaking of obliviousness, that after events at Hogwarts hadturned serious, they really really really REALLY should have reconsideredthe decision made on First Thursday, at the behest of Professor McGona* 1788 *gall, not to tell Dumbledore about the sense of doom that Harry got around Professor Quirrell. It was true that Harry hadn’t been sure who to trust, therewas a long stretch where it had seemed plausible that Dumbledore wasthe bad guy and Professor Quirrell the heroic opposition, but…Dumbledore would have realised.Dumbledore would have realised instantly.The wise old wizard with the true phoenix on his shoulder would haveknown, and Harry hadn’t trusted him, Harry hadn’t told him all the relevant facts, and the reason for this had been sheer neglect to reconsider acached decision made four days into the start of the school year. It hadbeen marked ‘something not to tell Dumbledore’ and even after Azkaban,even after Hermione died, even after everything, Harry had simply forgotto promote the question to deliberation and reconsider the tradeoff.Another wave of grief and shame washed over Harry, and for a time hewalked on in the silence of the last voice, other voices being happy enoughto fill the gap.After what was at least several miles, and many grey thoughts, thestone tunnel ended.The Dark Lord climbed up stone steps, and Harry followed after.The two of them came into a dark, dank stone building. Dirty oldstone doors swung open without being touched.Before them lay marble slabs, rising up from bare ground, upon themnames and dates. The tombstones were scattered in nothing like neatrows, and the rest of the graveyard ran wild.The moon above was over three-quarters full, already seeming brightwith night not fully fallen.Harry had stopped walking upon seeing the graveyard. There was ablaring alarm in his brain saying to be anywhere other than here, but thereweren’t any options for accomplishing that. So that alarm cried unanswered, even as behind Harry the stone doors of the mausoleum swungshut again and sealed themselves.The Dark Lord came into the center of the scattered graveyard. Hestopped walking, and waved his wand above his head in a small circle.There was a rumbling sound, and smoothly from the ground rose analtar, at least two meters wide and of black stone carved with grey sig* 1789 *ils. And then surrounding the altar groaned up six dark-marble obelisks,regularly spaced, gleaming darkly beneath the fading twilight sky.The unanswerable alarm in Harry’s brain grew louder.“This,” said the Dark Lord in Professor Quirrell’s cadences, “isa workspace I made for myself, convenient to either Hogwarts orHogsmeade.” The Dark Lord flourished a hand at the altar. “That iswhere Miss Granger shall revive, and also where I shall be reborn intomy true body. I shall remake myself first, of course. Magicss to revive girlchild eassier with true body.” A strange snakish laughter accompanied thesewords. “Resst asssured that though ssome asspects of girl-child'ss ressurrectionsshall be what otherss conssider Dark, girl-child will not be harmed or made ugly byit. Sshall sstill look like hersself, mind sshall be her own, nor sshall I or mine harm herafter.”Harry’s tongue was dry and his mind was having trouble functioning.“Please, Professor, would you say in Parseltongue what is your real purpose in resurrecting Miss Granger?”“To resstore to you girl-child friend'ss counssel and resstraint. To make ssure ssheiss part of the world for you to care about. That, boy, iss truly the greater part of thereasson I am doing thiss deed.” Again snakish laughter accompanied thesewords, conveying sardonic awareness of some vast irony.A small spark of hope kindled inside Harry, alongside the muchgreater note of confusion, and the fear that a perfect Occlumens couldindeed lie in Parseltongue. Harry didn’t understand why the Dark Lordwas doing this, if the next step was just to kill the Boy-Who-Lived orenslave him…Maybe he’d just never understood Professor Quirrell at all, maybesomehow Harry’s model of Tom Riddle was just that wrong… maybe theBoy-Who-Lived would be Obliviated of the last day and dropped offsomewhere with a confused Hermione Granger, while Lord Voldemortwent on to conquer the world…?Hope flared up in Harry, but it was a confused hope that didn’t makeany sense. It didn’t square with the Dark Lord who had mocked Dumbledore and laughed at his defeat. Harry couldn’t come up with any consistent account of Professor Quirrell’s motives that allowed for somethinglike that.I do not know what is meant to happen next.The Dark Lord had moved forward to the altar. He knelt there, andseemed to reach deep into the stone of the altar itself, drawing forth avial of liquid that looked black in the fading twilight.When the Dark Lord spoke again his voice was clipped and precise.“Blood, blood, blood so wisely hidden,” said the Dark Lord.And the obelisks surrounding the altar began to speak, voices like achanting chorus coming from the motionless stones, cadances older thanLatin.Apokatastethi, apokatastethi, apokatastethi to soma mou emoi.Apokatastethi, apokatastethi, apokatastethi to soma mou emoi.The obelisks’ chant echoed after the end of each line, as if they werespeaking out of synchrony with each other. The blood was poured fromthe vial, and it seemed to catch and hang over the altar, slowly expandingthrough the air, taking on a shape.Apokatastethi, apokatastethi, apokatastethi to soma mou emoi (emoi).Apokatastethi, apokatastethi, apokatastethi to soma mou emoi (emoi).A tall form rested upon the altar, and even in the dimming twilight itlooked too pale.The Defense Professor reached his hand into his robe, and drew fortha small irregular chunk of red glass.He placed that upon the tall pale body.The Stone stayed there for a time, minutes at least. The irregularchunk of red glass did not glow, or flash, or give any other indication ofpower.Then the Stone moved, just a little, turning slightly upon the body.The Defense Professor took back the Stone into his robes, and prodded the tall form that lay motionless upon the altar, touching the eyeswith his fingers, poking the chest with his wand.He threw back his head, then, and laughed.“Incredible,” said the Dark Lord, in the voice of the Defense Professor that Harry had known. “Fixed, it is fixed in form! A mere constructsustained by magic, become the true substance at the Stone’s touch! Andyet I sensed nothing! Nothing! I feared I had been deceived, that I hadobtained a false Stone, but the substance proves true to my every test!”1791 *The Defense Professor tucked the red glass back into his robes. “That iseldritch even by my standards, I admit.”Then the Defense Professor walked around the altar, five times hewalked around it, chanting something too low for Harry to hear.The Dark Lord placed his wand in the hand of the figure lying on thealtar.He placed his hands, both of them, over the body’s forehead.The Dark Lord spoke. “Fal. Tor. Pan.”Without any warning there was a flash like lightning that lit up theentire graveyard, and Harry staggered back a step, his hands involuntarily going to his forehead. It felt as if he had been shot there, or a waspstung him, upon his scar.The Defense Professor collapsed.And the too-tall figure sat up upon the altar.It swung around smoothly, and stood tall upon the ground, at leasta head higher than a normal man. The form’s limbs were lean and pale,little-muscled but giving an impression of terrible strength.Harry took another staggering step back, his hands still clasped to hisscar. Though the distance between them was wide, Harry felt a senseof terrifying apprehension in the air, as though the sense of doom hadalways been been out of focus and had now clarified, concentrated into aphysical pain in the scar on Harry’s forehead.Was that what Voldemort was supposed to look like? The nose lookedlike, it looked like it had malfunctioned during the resurrection process—The too-tall figure threw back his head and laughed, raising his handsand wand to look at them. The left hand opened wide and it was like apale half-spider with four over-long legs, fingers caressing the wand heldin the other hand. Leaves stirred up from the graveyard, approachingto dance around the too-tall figure, surrounding him and clothing him,reforming into a high-necked shirt and flowing robes; and Lord Voldemort was laughing. Exactly the mirthless laughter that Harry remembered coming from his own throat inside the Dementor’s nightmare, precise in tone and timbre.Red eyes gleamed beneath the fading twilight, their pupils slitted likea cat’s.The form that Voldemort had abandoned raised itself, quivering,from the ground; and in a voice that Harry could barely hear, QuirinusQuirrell gasped, “Free—oh, free—”“Stupefy,” said the high cold voice of Voldemort, and Quirinus Quirrellwas blasted down into the ground; then, with a wave of Voldemort’s otherhand, Quirinus Quirrell was picked up and flung away from the altar.Voldemort walked away from the altar, then turned and looked atHarry; and the pain in Harry’s scar flared at it.“Frightened, child?” Voldemort hissed, like there was an undercurrent of Parseltongue even to the Dark Lord’s human speech. “Good. Placethe girl on the altar, and break your Transfiguration. Iss time for me to reviveher.”Is this really going to happen? Are we really going to do this?Harry swallowed, mastering his fear through that note of impossiblehope amid the confusion, and walked over to the altar. Then Harry tookoff his left shoe, and his left sock, and took off the toe-ring that was Hermione Granger, the Transfigured shape identical to the toe-ring that hadbeen given Harry as an emergency portkey. There was a twinge of regretin Harry for not having the real portkey now, but only a twinge; an innercircle Death Eater would routinely put up boundaries against portkeys, ifSeverus had been right. Behind Harry, Voldemort laughed again in whatsounded like surprised appreciation.“I need my wand to Finite her,” Harry said aloud.“You do not.” High the voice and cruel. “You learned to sustain a Transfiguration by touch alone, without further use of the wand. You can likewise break your own Transfiguration wandlessly, by commanding yoursustaining magic to drain away. Do so now.”Harry swallowed, and touched the toe-ring. He had to try three times,and clear his mind, before he could push his magic out of the toe-ring, asbefore he had learned to make a tiny stream of magic flow in.The breaking of the spell went much more slowly that way than a Finite Incantatem, almost like the sped-up reverse of watching somethingbeing Transfigured. The toe-ring distorted, flowing together, expanding.Colors changed, textures changed.Two-thirds of a dead girl lay strewn across the altar, on her side withone arm falling off the altar’s edge, the position in which the reversionhad chanced to place her. No blood flowed now from the chewed stumpsof her thighs. The dead girl wore Hermione Granger’s face, but twistedand pale. It was as Harry had seen before in the hospital’s back room,the image burned into his brain during thirty long minutes of Transfiguration, the image he had reproduced during four even longer hours toTransfigure the decoy. The dead girl was naked, for her clothes were notpart of her, and had not been Transfigured.The sight brought back flashbacks, of the hours spent in the infirmaryroom, of the nightmares afterward, all of which Harry suppressed.“Go back,” said Voldemort’s high voice. “This is my work, now.”Harry swallowed, and retreated from the altar, to the mouth of thelong corridor where he’d stood before. “Her body is, should be, aroundfive Celsius, I cooled her so, so there wouldn’t be brain damage—” Harry’sown voice was wavering in pitch. Is he really going to do this? Really? Therehad to be a catch and Harry just couldn’t see it. Voldemort had said thatneither he nor any of his would harm Hermione, that her body and mindwould be her own—why?Voldemort walked forth to the altar once more, orienting the body before him with a wave of his hand to lie straight across the altar. The DarkLord spoke with high monotone precision, “Flesh, flesh, flesh so wiselyhidden.”The obelisks began chanting once more.Apokatastethi, apokatastethi, apokatastethi to soma hou emoi (emoi).Apokatastethi, apokatastethi, apokatastethi to soma hou emoi (emoi).New flesh flowed out of the stumps of the girl’s thighs, creeping forward like an ooze and solidifying.The obelisks ceased chanting. A complete form lay naked upon thealtar.It didn’t look like Hermione. A Hermione Granger should be standingup and talking, she should have her Hogwarts uniform.Voldemort raised a hand, then hissed, as though in annoyance. Witha violent gesture, the robes around Quirinus Quirrell’s sleeping fromwere torn in half, his purple-and-green tie shredded, and his suit-jacketdrawn from him to where Voldemort stood. Some part of Harry flinched,as if seeing the Dark Lord Voldemort attacking Professor Quirrell.Voldemort plunged his hand deliberately into the suit jacket, whichjerked as though something were being broken; then Voldemort shookout the suit jacket onto the ground beside him, emptying out the contents.Harry’s pouch fell from it, and his Time-Turner, and a broomstick, andVoldemort’s gun, and the Cloak, and a number of amulets and rings andstranger devices that Harry did not recognize.And finally a chunk of red glass, which was laid upon Hermione Granger’s form, and allowed to stay there for a time.Minutes passed. The Dark Lord donned an amulet from the heap ofthings beside the altar; also from the heap, Voldemort took four shortwooden rods with straps upon them, and reached beneath his robes toattach them, it looked like they went on his upper arms and upper thighs.The Dark Lord rose into the air, moved left, right, up and down, seemingto wobble slightly at first; then his flight stabilized.The chunk of red glass turned, slightly.The Dark Lord Voldemort floated to the ground, and prodded Hermione Granger’s body with his wand.“There iss an obsstacle,” hissed Voldemort.In Harry’s mind the expectation of betrayal or other failure had already been so strong that the confirmation came only as a dull shock, nota sharp one. “What obsstacle?”“Girl'ss body iss resstored. Ssubstance iss repaired. But not magic, or life… thiss issbody of dead Muggle.” Voldemort turned from the altar, began to pace. “Thefull ritual would solve this. But that would require time… time and theblood of Granger’s enemy, and I do not think Draco Malfoy still qualifies,nor can I take my own blood unwillingly… foolish.” Voldemort’s voice wasa lower hiss. “Foolish, I should have foreseen this, and prepared. Herbrain might awaken with an electrical shock, I know that much of Mugglemedicine… but would her magic return to her? That I do not know, andI suspect if she awakens as a Muggle she will be a Muggle forever. Still, Ican think of nothing better.” The Dark Lord raised his wand—“Wait!” Harry blurted, feeling hope return. She needs a spark of life andmagic, just a spark to get her started…Voldemort turned and looked at him. The snakelike face showedsome slight degree of surprise.“Think I have ssomething that might work,” Harry hissed. “Needss wand.Have no intentionss to usse it againsst you.” Harry said nothing about expecting his intentions wouldn’t change; he’d simply blurted out the idea fastenough that he hadn’t formed any specific intentions yet.“This,” Voldemort hissed, “I desire to see.” The Dark Lord reachedinto the heap of things by the altar, and picked up the wrapped form ofHarry’s wand. It was thrown, gliding through the air and then droppingat Harry’s feet; and then the Dark Lord floated back, the heap of thingsmoving smoothly backwards with him.Harry unwrapped his wand, and moved forward.We have our wand back, that’s step one, said the last voice, the voice ofhope.No part of Harry had any idea what step two might be, but it was stillstep one accomplished.And Harry stood before the reformed body of Hermione Granger,who was still naked and dead, on a twilight-lit stone altar.“Lord Voldemort,” Harry said, “I beg you, please give her some clothes.It might help me do this.”“Granted,” hissed Voldemort. The pain in Harry’s scar flared as thenaked girl’s body lifted into the air, then flared again as dead leavesdanced around her and she was clothed in the seeming of a Hogwartsuniform, though the trim was red instead of blue. Hermione Granger’shands folded over her chest, her legs straightened, and her body driftedback down.Harry looked at her.Focused on her, now that she looked human again.She looks like she is sleeping, not dead. It took a conscious effort to lookfor breathing, fail to see it, and make the deduction. So far as naked perception was concerned… Hermione might as well be alive, right now.That Hermione Granger would not approve of this situation, takenas a whole, seemed beyond question. But it didn’t mean that she wouldrather stay dead than be alive, other things being equal, though theymight not be.Because you wish to live, because my best guess is that you would wish to live…Harry reached out his shaking left hand, and touched Hermione’sforehead. It was warm now, not the chill of five degrees Celsius; eitherVoldemort had increased her body temperature to normal, or the magicof the ritual had done it automatically. Which meant that Hermione’sbrain was currently warm and without oxygen, come to think.That did it, the sense of urgency rising in him.Harry’s feet assumed the stance, his wand swung up to point at Hermione Granger’s dead body. The only thing wrong with Hermione’s bodywas that it was dead; everything else about that body was right, only onething needed changing.You don’t belong here, death.“Expecto,” Harry shouted, feeling the magic and the life rise up into thePatronus Charm that was fueled by both, “PATRONUM!”The girl in the Hogwarts uniform was surrounded by a blazing auraof silver fire, as the Patronus was born inside her.Harry staggered, as he felt a dip, a bite. Intuition or Tom Riddle’smemory told Harry that the life and magic that had just flowed into Hermione would never return to him, either one. It hadn’t been all his lifeor all his magic, not by a long shot, there hadn’t been time to expend thatmuch, but whatever he’d just expended was gone forever.And Hermione Granger was breathing, just like she was sleeping,rhythmic inhalations and exhalations. The twilight sky had dimmedfurther, and Harry could not see if color was returning to her, but itshould have been, it certainly should have been. She looked to be sleeping peacefully, and it wasn’t because being dead looked like sleeping,it was because she was asleep and her body was fine and nothing washurting her while she slept.Some part of Harry, that had somehow managed not to speak up earlier, quietly pointed out that they were still in a graveyard, the recentlyvictorious Lord Voldemort was still in control of the situation, and thathis guess about Hermione wanting to be alive was just a guess.Harry was still smiling, as he slowly lowered his wand. The celebratory fireworks going off inside his mind were restrained, Harry wasn’tscreaming and running around in little circles like Professor Flitwick, butthat—That—THAT, Harry said aloud inside his mind, THAT is what I call Step Two.“Interesting,” said the cold high voice. “Your Patronus draws uponyour life as well as your magic… I guessed that much, for it was too powerful for a first-year to fuel with magic alone. And yet there must be moreto the puzzle, since not just any life-fueled spell would have done… wasyour happy thought the image of her returning to life? Was that all ittook?” Lord Voldemort was again toying with his wand, a dark interestin those red-slitted eyes. “I suspect I will feel quite stupid when I finallycomprehend that spell, someday in my eternity. Now step away from thegirl. There iss more work I intend to do, to give her besst chance of continued life.”Harry stepped back, reluctantly, the sense of tension starting to return to him. He almost tripped over one haphazard grave marker, as theDark Lord continued to walk forward.Standing before the altar, the Dark Lord laid one finger upon Hermione Granger’s forehead.Then the Dark Lord tapped his finger upon Hermione Granger’s forehead, and said, in a voice so low Harry almost did not hear, “Requiescus.”Voldemort waved his hand at an obelisk, which began to rotate, turning itself to lay flat upon the ground, pointing outward. “Fascinating indeed,” Voldemort hissed. “She is alive, and magical, and not another TomRiddle as I feared you might have made her.”The tension was rising again in Harry. He’d put his wand away intothe back belt of his pants, he did not want to remind Voldemort that he stillhad the wand on him. “What are you doing to her now?”Another obelisk turned, lay flat upon the ground. “There iss old, losst ritual to ssacriﬁce magical creature, transsfer magical nature to ssubject. Limitationssare great. Transsfer iss temporary, only few hourss. Ssubject ssometimess diess whentranssfer wearss off. But Sstone will make permanent.”Four obelisks lay flat upon the ground, evenly spaced; the other twoobelisks had been floated away.Voldemort began to reach into his own mouth, checked himself,hissed with annoyance again. He gestured at the sleeping mouth of Quir* 1798 *inus Quirrell, and from Quirrell’s mouth floated up two teeth, almostinvisible in the falling night. One of these went to the pile of items, theother floated to before the altar.Moments later, Harry cried out and took a step back.Huge and misshapen, lumpy skin, legs thick as tree-trunks, a smallhead that looked like a coconut perched upon a boulder.A mountain troll stood within the circle of obelisks, motionless asthough asleep while standing.“What are you doing?”Voldemort’s mouth was stretched in a wide smile; it looked horrible onhim, like his face had too many teeth. “Sshall ssacriﬁce my fallback weapon,and girl-child sshall gain troll'ss power of regeneration. Transsﬁguration ssicknesssiss nothing before that, if perchance it wass not ﬁxed by previouss ritual. And no knifesshall sslay girl-child, nor cutting cursse, nor ssicknesss take her.”“Why—why are you doing this?” Harry’s voice shook.“Have not the tiniesst intention of letting girl-child die again, after going to ssuchlengthss to ressurrect her.”Harry swallowed. “I’m very confused.” Was Voldemort practicing being nice? This hypothesis did not seem like a sufficient explanation.“Stay well back,” Voldemort said coldly. “This ritual is Darker than thelast.” The Dark Lord began a new chant, softer syllables that seemed toseethe through the air like living things; and Harry, feeling a new surgeof apprehension, stepped backwards.Then Harry cried aloud, as pain flared again within his scar. Themountain troll crumbled in on itself, becoming ashes hanging in theair, then dust, and then the dust seemed to blow away without goinganywhere; it was gone.Hermione Granger slept on peacefully, whatever spell of reposeVoldemort had cast on her being sufficient to the task.“Um,” Harry said in a small voice. “Did it work?”“Diffindo.”Harry stepped forward with a choked yell, and then halted, both asthe stupidity of his motion caught up with him, and as the sudden cutthat the Severing Charm had opened on Hermione’s leg closed almost asquickly as it had been made. In seconds there was only a light stain ofblood on the surrounding flesh.The Stone was laid again on Hermione, and after a time it turned.Voldemort laughed once more, as he passed his hand over her. “Marvelous.”Then another tiny tooth was floating within the circle of obelisks; andan instant later, a unicorn stood where the troll had stood before, eyes dulland head lowered.“What?” Harry said. “Why a unicorn?”“Power of unicorn'ss blood to presserve life makess excellent combination withtroll'ss healing. Only Fiendfyre and Killing Cursse sshall girl-child fear, from thiss day.”A flicker of snakish laughter. “Bessidess, had sspare unicorn left over, might asswell usse.”“Unicorn’s blood has side effects-”“That iss only when power of unicorn'ss blood iss sstolen by another. Thiss sspellwill make power of unicorn belong insside girl-child, ass if sshe wass alwayss born thatway.”The grim chant and its seething words began again.Harry watched, not understanding in the slightest.Forget understanding, what am I seeing?I’m seeing the Dark Lord Voldemort going to enormous lengths to resurrectHermione Granger and keep her alive. It’s like he thinks that his own life dependson Hermione Granger being alive, somehow.The confused parts of Harry looked around for a procedure to follow.‘Make a prediction based on your best current hypothesis’ was the firstthought that came to mind, but it didn’t seem to lead anywhere. The plotof the story wasn’t going how it ought to, after the villain had won.Again the blaze of pain in his scar, like a blow to Harry’s forehead. Theunicorn swayed, and then disintegrated as the troll had done.The Dark Lord laid the Stone upon Hermione’s form once more, clasping her hands around it.Voldemort watched the unremarkable process for a time, then turnedwhile the Stone still laid on her, making a high humming sound in histhroat. “Ah, yes,” hissed Voldemort. “That would be most appropriate. Doyou still have the diary I gave you, boy? The diary of the famous scientist?”Harry’s brain took a moment to place what Voldemort was talkingabout. It had been in Mary’s Room, in Mary’s Place, in October, that precious gift from a friend. The thought should have triggered a wave ofawful sadness, for the Professor Quirrell that had been lost or never real;but there had been enough of that emotion already, and his brain had setit aside for now.“Yes,” Harry said aloud. “I think it’s in my pouch, can I check?” Harryknew it was in the pouch. He’d loaded it up with everything that he mightpossibly conceivably need, that he owned or had bought; everything thatcould have been a quest item.From the heap of items by the altar, Harry’s mokeskin pouch wasdrawn out, tossed to Harry’s feet.“Roger Bacon’s diary,” Harry said as he reached in a hand, and thediary appeared. Professor Quirrell had said that the diary would emergeunscathed from a fire, so Harry threw it toward Voldemort’s altar. Harrydid not wince; there were more important things to worry about thanpolite treatment of books, even that one.Voldemort picked up the diary, examining it, appearing quite absorbed.Harry, as quietly and unobtrusively as he could, attached the pouch tohis belt loop in back, where it wouldn’t be visible, near where Harry hadput his wand.Step three, the pouch.“Yes,” Voldemort hissed as he flipped pages of the diary, “this will doquite well.” The Stone moved slightly, and the Dark Lord’s other handstored the Stone again within his robes.“What was your hidden purpose behind the diary?” Harry said whenthe pouch was attached to his belt, and he’d put both of his empty handswhere Voldemort could see them again. “I tried translating a little at thebeginning, but it was going slowly—” Actually, it had been excruciatinglyslow and Harry had found other priorities.“Diary wass exactly what it sseemed, a gift meant to sseduce you to my sside.”Voldemort made intricate gestures in the air with his wand, not even looking at what his hand was doing, as he held the diary in his other hand. Fora moment Harry thought he could see a trail of darkness in the air, butthe moonlight was too faint for certainty. “And now, my dear boy,” Voldemort’s high voice was laced with grim amusement, as his wand brieflytapped Hermione Granger’s forehead with a casual gesture, “I make thisdiary into a far more precious gift, a sign of how much wisdom I havelearned from you. For I would never want you to be deprived of HermioneGranger’s counsel and restraint, not ever while the stars yet live. Avadakedavra.”The green bolt of the Killing Curse blazed out faster than Harry couldpossibly have cast the Patronus Charm, faster than he could possibly havemoved, it was already over even as Harry cried out and went for his wand.Quirinus Quirrell’s unconscious body did not even jerk, in death. Thegreen light struck into it without other sign.Darkness glowed in the air, anti-light in the trails that Voldemort hadmade before, and the Diary of Roger Bacon darkened as though corruption were creeping over it, even as a shiver appeared in the air aroundHermione Granger’s form.The pain in Harry’s scar flared overwhelmingly, like a brand driveninto his forehead, it sent Harry dodging unthinkingly to one side as TomRiddle’s reflexes took over.And Voldemort was also screaming, shrieking as he dropped the diaryto the ground, holding his own head and screaming.Chance—The last voice of hope said that, as Harry tried frantically to think, tounderstand. There wasn’t any point in trying to kill Voldemort now, itmight only annoy him, weapons couldn’t kill him while any of his hundreds of horcruxes remained—But it still seemed worth it to temporarily discarnate Voldemort, takethe Stone and Hermione and run.Harry’s right hand had already taken his wand. His left hand wentaround to his back, reached awkwardly into his pouch, began to make asilent sign, three English letters.“No!” cried Voldemort. He’d dropped his hands from his head, wasstaring at Hermione’s body as though bewildered. “No, no!”The item came up from Harry’s pouch into his hand, and Harry beganto step forward as smoothly as he could, diminishing the range betweenthem to what his brief trials had shown was doable.“My great creation—” gasped Voldemort. His voice was high, sounding panicked. “Two different spirits cannot exist in the same world—itis gone, it is severed! A horcrux, I must make a horcrux at once—” Voldemort’s gaze fell on Hermione Granger’s still-sleeping form, and he beganto raise his wand in the air, executing the same gestures as before.Harry raised his gun and pulled the trigger three times.ven as Harry had raised the gun, he’d known he was making a mistake,his forebrain saw it and tried to stop his hand, but somehow the sickcertainty didn’t propagate fast enough to prevent his finger from pullingthe trigger—The echo of the shots died away within the graveyard.A fraction of a second before Harry had pulled the trigger, Voldemorthad jabbed his wand downward, and a wide wall of dirt had shot up between them from the graveyard earth, intercepting all three bullets.An instant after that, pain flared in Harry’s scar, a crawling feelingcame close to his skin; and then Harry’s pouch, clothes, gun, everythingexcept his wand disappeared, leaving him naked but for the wand stillin his right hand, and the glasses he’d Charmed to stick to his nose. Thesteel ring upon his left pinky finger was yanked off hard enough to scrapeskin, taking the Transfigured jewel with it.“That,” said the voice of Voldemort from behind the dirt wall, “wasabsolutely predictable. Do you really think I would shout it aloud for youto hear, if my immortality were disrupted? Really, stupid child? Loweryour wand, do not raise it up again at any time, or you die upon the spot.”Harry swallowed, and pointed his wand downward. “You would havebeen disappointed in me,” Harry said, his own voice now unusually high,“if I’d missed an opportunity like that, I mean.” There was no time tothink, and Harry’s mouth was operating on autopilot for trying to placateevil overlords that might have paternal feelings for you and whom you’djust failed to assassinate.Voldemort stepped around from behind the dirt wall, smiling thathorrible smile that seemed to contain too many teeth. “I promised not toraise my hand or wand against you, child, if you did not raise your handor wand against me.”“I used bullets,” Harry said, his voice still high. “That’s not a fist or aspell.”“My curse thinks differently. That is the puzzle piece that you missed.Did you think I would leave the peace between us to mere fortune? BeforeI created you, I invoked a curse upon myself and all other Tom Riddleswho would descend from me. A curse to enforce that none of us wouldthreaten the others’ immortality, so long as the other made no attemptupon our own. Typical of that ridiculous fiasco, the curse seems to haveended up binding me, but taking no hold upon the infant with his self solost.” A low, lethal chuckle. “But you tried to end my true life jusst then, sstupidchild. Now cursse iss lifted, and I may kill you any time I wissh.”“I see,” Harry said. He did see; that was why Voldemort had told himabout his horcrux system in the first place, just to set up the momentwhen Harry knowingly tried to violate his immortality. Harry’s mind wasfrantically churning through options, none of which seemed helpful. Hispouch, his clothes, Harry saw by the moonlight that they all now lay inanother heap by the altar, out of reach. “And now you kill me?” Harry stillhad his wand, presumably the Dark Lord couldn’t cast his own magic onthat, or his glasses, because of the disharmony. Cast my own spell first? No,Voldemort just jabs his wand downward to make another shield, then shoots me—what else is there? WHAT ELSE?“Still a fool. If no further matters remained between us, I would already have killed you.” The dirt wall crumbled at another gesture of thewand, and Voldemort moved smoothly back toward the heap of items bythe altar. The Dark Lord stretched out a hand, and the diary of Roger Bacon flew to him. “Thiss iss, indeed, horcrux of girl-child, my ssuperior verssion.” Inhis other hand appeared a parchment. “Thiss iss ritual for ressurrecting her,if it musst be done again. Insstructionss are honesst, no trapss. Remember that girlchild'ss sspirit cannot float free like ghosst, Ressurrection Sstone iss my horcrux, notherss. Do not losse her horcrux, or her sspirit may be trapped within it.” Voldemortreached down, picked up Harry’s pouch, fed both the diary and the parchment into it. “Remember that, in casse something goess wrong with next movess.”“I don’t understand what is happening,” Harry said. There was noth* 1806 *ing else left. “Please explain to me.”The Dark Lord was now regarding Harry with a grim look. “Whengirl-child died, wass in company of sschool'ss Sseer, heard prophecy sspoken that youwould become force of vasst desstruction. You would become threat beyond imagination, beyond apocalypsse. That iss why I went to ssuch lengthss to undo my killing ofgirl-child, keep it undone.”“Are,” what “are you sure,” what.“Dare not ssay sspeciﬁcss to you. Prophecy I heard of mysself led me to fulﬁll it.Have not forgotten that dissasster.” Voldemort backed further away fromHarry, red slitted eyes fixed upon the Boy-Who-Lived, gun unwaveringin the left hand. “All thiss, all I have done, iss to ssmassh that desstiny at everypoint of intervention. If ssome fate makess me fail in what comess next, idiot-childof foretold desstruction, then you musst kill yoursself to ssave girl-child. Elsse all youclaim to value diess by your own hand.”“I,” Harry’s voice went up an octave, “I,” another octave, “I really reallywouldn’t do that, seriously!”“Ssilence, fool. Remain ssilent unlesss given leave by me to sspeak. Keep yourwand pointed down and do not raisse it unlesss told. Elsse you die upon the sspot,and mark that I ssaid that in Parsseltongue.” Voldemort reached into the altaragain.For a second Harry’s mind couldn’t process what he was seeing, andthen he saw that Voldemort was holding a human arm, severed near theshoulder; it seemed too thin, that arm.The Dark Lord pressed his wand to the flesh above the severed arm’selbow, and the fingers twitched, twitched like they were alive; by dimmoonlight Harry saw a darker mark appear on that flesh, just above theelbow.Seconds later the first hooded figure appeared inside the graveyardwith the popping sound of an Apparition. A moment after that came another pop, and then another.The hooded figures wore silver skull masks, and moonlight fled fromthe robes beneath them.“Master!” cried one of the black robes, the third to arrive. The voicewas of peculiar timbre, from behind the silver skull mask. “Master—ithas been so long—we had lost hope—”“Silence!” shouted the high voice of the Dark Lord Voldemort. Every trace of Professor Quirrell was now gone from the too-tall figure.“Train your wand upon the Boy-Who-Lived, and watch him! Do not bedistracted, not by anything! Stun him at once if he moves, if he begins tospeak!”More pops. Between graves, behind a tree, in all the shadowy spaces,more black robes were Apparating, all hooded and masked. Some of themvoiced exclamations of joy, many of those sounding rather forced; othersmoved forwards as though to greet their Master. Voldemort gave themall the same instruction, except that some were commanded to Cruciate Harry Potter if he moved, others to restrain the Boy-Who-Lived ifhe moved, others told to fire hexes and curses, others told to cancel hismagic.Thirty-seven pops, Harry counted before the black robes and skullmasks seemed to stop arriving.All of them were now holding their wands pointed at Harry, alignedin a semicircle before him, where they wouldn’t get into each other’s linesof fire.Harry continued pointing his wand downward, insofar as he hadbeen told that, if he tried to raise it, he would die. He remained silent,insofar as he had been told that if he tried to speak, he would die. Hetried not to shiver in the falling night temperatures, for he was naked,and it was getting colder.You know, said the last voice within Harry, the voice of hope, I thinkthis is getting pretty bad even by my standards.he gibbous moon riding higher in the cloudless sky, the stars andwash of the Milky Way visible in all their majesty within the darkness: All these illuminated thirty-seven skull masks gleaming above blackrobes, and the darker-clad Lord Voldemort, whose eyes shone red.“Welcome, my Death Eaters,” spoke Lord Voldemort’s voice, smoothand high and terrible. “No, do not look at me, you fools! Eyes upon thePotter child! Ten years, it has been, ten years since we last met. Yet youanswer my call as though it were yesterday…” The Dark Lord Voldemortcame near to one hooded figure, tapped fingers upon the mask. “In ahastily Transfigured mockery of a Death Eater’s true armor, with a childishCharm to distort your voice. Explain, Mr. Honor.”“Our old masks and robes…” said the robe whose mask the Dark Lordhad tapped. Even through the distorting timbre of the mask, the fear in itwas audible. “We… we were not fighting in them, Master, with you gone…so I did not maintain their enchantments… and then you summoned meto appear here, masked, and I… I always held faith in you, Master, but Idid not know you would return this very day… I am truly sorry to havedispleased you…”“Enough.” The Dark Lord moved on to stand behind another figure,that seemed to tremble, though it kept its mask facing the Boy-WhoLived, and its wand held level. “I might think more kindly of such neglect, if you had pursued my agenda by other means… Mr. Counsel. YetI return to find—what? A country conquered in my name?” The highvoice climbed higher. “No! I find you playing ordinary politics in theWizengamot! I find your brothers still abandoned in Azkaban! It is adisappointment to me… I confess myself disappointed… You thoughtI was gone, the Dark Mark dead, and you forsook my purpose. Is thatright, Mr. Counsel?”“No, Master!” cried that masked figure. “We knew you would return—but, but we could not fight Dumbledore without you—”“Crucio.”A horrible scream tore out of the mask, piercing the night, it continued for long, long seconds.“Get up,” the Dark Lord said to the figure that had collapsed upon theground. “Keep your wand on Harry Potter. Do not lie to me again.”“Yes, Master,” sobbed the figure, as it pushed itself to its feet.Voldemort resumed pacing behind the black-robed figures. “I suppose you are also wondering what Harry Potter is doing here… Why he isa guest at my rebirthing party.”“I know, Master!” said one of the robes. “You mean to prove yourpower by killing him, in front of us all, to leave no doubt as to which ofyou is stronger! To show how your Killing Curse can slay even this socalled Boy-Who-Lived!”There was a pause. None of the cloaked figures dared to speak.Slowly, the Dark Lord Voldemort, in his high-collared shirt and darkrobes, turned to face the Death Eater who had spoken.“That,” whispered Voldemort in a voice chill as death, “is a little toomuch folly for me to credit, Mr. Sallow. You heard that theory of how Idied, and tried to provoke me into repeating a mistake?” Lord Voldemortwas floating, rising high off the ground. “I suppose you came to preferyour laziness to my mastery, Macnair?”The Death Eater who’d spoken was suddenly surrounded by a bluehaze. He spun, slashed his wand at the Dark Lord, and cried “Avada Kedavra!”Voldemort simply tilted to one side in midair, dodging the green bolt.“Avada Kedavra!” cried the Death Eater. His hand that didn’t hold awand was making other gestures, further colors and layers building up inhis shielding haze with each gesture completed. “Help me, my brothers!If we all—”The Death Eater fell in seven flaming pieces to the ground, chunks offlesh with the cauterized edges still glowing.“Eyes and wands on Harry Potter, all of you,” Voldemort repeated, hisvoice low and dangerous. “And Macnair acted in sheer stupidity just then,for I command your Marks, as I always shall. I am immortal.”“Master,” said another robe. “The girl upon the altar—is she to serveus for a Dark Revel? She seems unworthy of such a joyous occasion. Icould find better, Master, if you give me leave for just a short time—”“No, Mr. Friendly,” said Voldemort, sounding rather amused. “The little witch you see upon the altar is none other than Hermione Granger—”“What?” cried one of the black robes, and then, “I’m sorry, Master, I’msorry, I beg your—”“Crucio.” This screaming only lasted a few seconds, and Voldemorthad performed it as though it were perfunctory. Afterward Voldemort’svoice returned to low amusement. “I have resurrected this mudbloodthrough the Darkest of magics, for my own purposes. You shall not offer her the slightest trouble, any of you. You are better off dead than ifI learn my little experiment came to harm at your hands. This order isabsolute, regardless of other circumstances—even if she escapes, let ussay.” A cold high laugh, as if at some joke that nobody else understood.“Master,” one of the robes said in a faltering voice distorted by hisskull mask. “Master, please—I would never defy you, I am obedient as yousee—but Master, I beg you, let me return, the better to serve you later—I came here in haste, forsaking—Master, with so many of us being gone,others will wonder, they will mark the absences, who has disappeared.Soon there shall be no alibi I can offer.”A cold high laugh. “Ah, Mr. White, the most delinquent of my servants.I have not yet decided if you will survive your punishment. I have lessneed of you than I once did, Mr. White. In two days’ time the Death Eatersshall walk openly. My powers have increased, and I have just this day disposed of Dumbledore.” More gasps of shock arose from the Death Eaters,Voldemort paid them no heed. “Tomorrow I shall slay Bones, Crouch,Moody, and Scrimgeour, if they have not fled. The rest of you shall gointo the Ministry and the Wizengamot, and cast Imperius Curses as I direct you. We are finished waiting. By tomorrow’s nightfall I shall havedeclared myself Lord Ruler of Britain!”1811 *Intakes of breath rose from the gathered masks, but one figure waslaughing.“You find me amusing, Mr. Grim?”“Apologies, Master,” said the robed figure who had laughed, his wandperfectly level upon where Harry stood. “I was glad to hear you had dispatched Dumbledore. I fled from Britain in cowardly fear of him, havinglost faith in your return.”Voldemort’s chuckle resounded within the graveyard. “Your candorearns you my mercy, Mr. Grim. I was surprised to see you here tonight;you are more competent than I suspected. But before we turn our attention to happier matters, there is a certain affair to which we must attend.Tell me, Mr. Grim, if the Boy-Who-Lived swore an oath to you, might youtrust him?”“Master… I don’t understand…” said Mr. Grim. One or two of the otherDeath Eaters turned their masks toward Voldemort before quickly fixingthe skull gaze on Harry.“Answer me,” Voldemort hissed. “This is not a trick, Mr. Grim, andyou will answer truthfully or bear the consequences. You knew the boy’sforebears, did you not? Knew them for straightforward folk? If the boyfreely chose to swear to you an oath, even knowing you for a Death Eater,might you trust in his words? Answer me!” Voldemort’s voice rose to ashriek.“I… yes, Master, I suppose I might…”“Good,” Voldemort said coldly. “The potential for trust must exist, tobe sacrificed. And for the bonder of the Unbreakable Vow… which of youshall sacrifice their magic? It shall be quite the long Vow… much longerthan usual… much magic shall be required for that…” Voldemort smiledhis awful smile. “Mr. White shall do.”“No, please! Master, I beg you! I served you better than any—as best Icould—”“Crucio,” said Voldemort, and Mr. White screamed through his mask’sdistortion for what seemed like a full minute. “Be grateful if I leave youyour life! Now approach the boy, Mr. Grim, Mr. White. From behind him,idiot! You must not block the others’ wands! And the rest of you, you1812 *must fire if Harry Potter tries to run, even if it means striking at yourfellow Death Eaters.”Mr. White took time to approach, the black robes seeming to shake,even as Mr. Grim moved smoothly into position.“What is to be the Vow, Master?” came the voice of Mr. Grim.“Ah, yes,” Voldemort said. The Dark Lord went on pacing behind thesemicircle of Death Eaters. “Today—though I hardly expect even you tobelieve me—today we are doing Merlin’s work, my Death Eaters. Yes! Before us stands a great danger, who in his blundering folly has been prophesied to wreak destruction such as even I can scarcely imagine. The BoyWho-Lived! The boy who frightens Dementors! The cattle who believe theyown this world should have been more worried when they saw that. Useless, all of them!”“Forgive me—” said one black robe in a halting voice. “Master—surely,if that is so—Master, why don’t we just kill him right away?”Voldemort laughed, a strange bitter laugh. When he spoke on hishigh voice was precise. “Here is the oath’s intent, Mr. Grim, Mr. White,Harry Potter. Listen well and comprehend the Vow that must be sworn,for its intent is also binding, and you three must share an understandingof its meaning. You will swear, Harry Potter, not to destroy the world, totake no risks when it comes to not destroying the world. This Vow maynot force you into any positive action, on account of that, this Vow doesnot force your hand to any stupidity. Do you understand that, Mr. Grim,Mr. White? We are dealing with a prophecy of destruction. A prophecy!They can fulfill themselves in twisted ways. We must be cautious that thisVow itself does not bring that prophecy about. We dare not let this Vowforce Harry Potter to stand idly after some disaster is already set in motion by his hand, because he must take some lesser risk if he tries to stop it.Nor must the Vow force him to choose a risk of truly vast destruction, overa certainty of lesser destruction. But all Harry Potter’s foolishness,” Voldemort’s voice climbed, “all his recklessness, all his grandiose schemes and goodintentions—he shall not risk them leading to disaster! He shall not gamble with the Earth’s fate! No researches that might lead to catastrophe!No unbinding of seals, no opening of gates!” Voldemort’s voice loweredagain. “Unless this very Vow itself is somehow leading into the destruc*1813 *tion of the world, in which case, Harry Potter, you must ignore it in thatparticular regard. You will not trust yourself alone in making such a determination, you must confide honestly and fully in your trusted friend, andsee if that one agrees. Such is this Vow’s meaning and intent. It forcesonly such acts as Harry Potter might choose himself, having learned thathe is a prophesied instrument of destruction. For the capacity for choicemust also exist, to be sacrificed. Do you understand, Mr. White?”“I—I think so—oh, Master, please, do not let the Vow be so long—”“Silence, fool, you do a more useful thing this day than you have everdone. Mr. Grim?”“I think, Master, that it must be repeated to me.”Voldemort smiled that too-wide smile, and said it all again using different words.“And now,” Voldemort said coldly, “Harry Potter, you will keep yourwand low, and permit Mr. Grim to touch his wand to yours; and you willspeak such words as I direct you. If Harry Potter speaks any other word,then cut him down, the rest of you.”“Yes, Master,” came the thirty-four-fold chorus.Harry was chilled, and shivering, and not only because he was nakedin the night. He didn’t understand why Voldemort was not just killinghim. There seemed to be only a single line leading into the future, andit was Voldemort’s chosen line, and Harry did not know what came afterthis.“Mr. White,” said Voldemort. “Touch your wand to Harry Potter’shand, and repeat these words. Magic that flows in me, bind this Vow.”Mr. White spoke those words. Even through the distortion effect ofhis mask, it sounded as though his heart were breaking.Behind Voldemort the obelisks chanted, a language that Harry didnot know; three times they repeated their words, then fell silent.“Mr. Grim,” said Voldemort. “Think of the reasons why you mighttrust this boy, if he had given this oath freely. Think of that potential fortrust, and sacrifice it as you say…”“By my trust that I hold for you,” said Mr. Grim, “be you held.”And then it was Harry Potter’s turn to repeat Lord Voldemort’s words,and Harry did so.1814 *“I vow…” Harry said. His voice shook, but he spoke. “That I shall not…by any act of mine… destroy the world… I shall take no chances… in notdestroying the world… if my hand is forced… I may take the course… oflesser destruction over greater destruction… unless it seems to me thatthis Vow itself… leads to the world’s end… and the friend… in whom I haveconfided honestly… agrees that this is so. By my own free will…” Harrycould feel it, as the rite was invoked, the shining cords of power wrapping around his wand and Mr. Grim’s wand, wrapping around his handwhere Mr. White’s wand touched it, wrapping around his self on somedisturbingly abstract level. Harry could feel himself invoking his powerof free choice, and he knew that his next words would sacrifice it, that thiswas absolutely the last chance to turn back.“…so shall it be,” said the coldly precise voice of Lord Voldemort.“…so shall it be,” Harry repeated, and he knew in that moment that thecontent of the Vow was no longer something he could decide whether ornot to do, it was simply the way in which his body and mind would move.It was not a vow he could break even by sacrificing his life in the process.Like water flowing downhill or a calculator summing numbers, it was justa thing-Harry-Potter-would-do.“Did the Vow take, Mr. White?”Mr. White sounded like he was weeping. “Yes, Master… I have lost somuch, please, I have been punished enough.”“Return to your places…” said Voldemort. “Good. All eyes on the Potter child, prepare to fire the instant he tries to flee, or raise his wand, orspeak any word…” The Dark Lord floated high in the air, the black-cladfigure overlooking the graveyard. Again he held a gun in his left hand,and his wand in his right. “Better. Now we shall kill the Boy-Who-Lived.”Mr. White staggered. Mr. Grim was laughing again, and so were others.“I did not do that to be funny,” Voldemort said coldly. “We are dealing with a prophecy, fools. We are snipping the threads of destiny oneby one; carefully, carefully, not knowing when we may first encounterresistance. This is the order in which the next acts shall be done. FirstHarry Potter shall be stunned, then his limbs severed and the woundscauterized. Mr. Friendly and Mr. Honor will examine him for any trace1815 *of unusual magics. One of you shall shoot the boy many times with myMuggle weapon, and then as many of you as can shall strike him with theKilling Curse. Only then will Mr. Grim crush his skull and brains withthe mundane substance of a tombstone. I shall verify his corpse, thenhis corpse shall be burned with Fiendfyre, then we will exorcise the surrounding area in case he has left a ghost. I myself will guard this placeuntil six hours have passed, for I do not fully trust the wards I have setagainst Time’s looping; and four of you shall search the surroundings forsigns of anything noteworthy. Even after that we must remain vigilantfor any sign of Harry Potter’s renewed presence, in case Dumbledore hasleft some unimagined trick in play. If you can think of any trick that Ihave missed in being sure that Harry Potter’s threat is ended, speak nowand I shall reward you handsomely… speak now, in Merlin’s name!”There was stunned silence amid the cemetery; no one made to speak.“Useless, the lot of you,” Voldemort said with bitter scorn. “Now Ishall ask Harry Potter one final question, and he is to answer that question for my ears alone, in Parseltongue. Strike the boy down at once ifhe answers with anything but hisses, if he tries to speak one word of human speech.” Then Voldemort hissed, “Power I know not, it wass ssaid thatyou would have. The Muggle Artss I have now learned of from you, and I am alreadysstudying them. Your power over life-eaterss musst be comprehended for onesself, orsso you ssay. If there iss any other power you posssesss, that I may come to have, tellme of it now. Elsse, I intend to torment certain of thosse you care for. Ssome livess Ihave already promissed you, but otherss I did not. Your mudblood sservantss in yourlittle army. Your preciouss parentss. All sshall ssuffer for what will sseem to them likeeternitiess; and then I sshall ssend them, broken, into the life-eater prisson to remember it, until they wasste and die. For each unknown power you tell me how to masster,or other ssecret you tell me that I desire to know, you may name one more of thosse toinsstead be protected and honored under my reign. Thiss alsso I promisse and intendto keep.” Voldemort’s smiling expression now came through as if it werea snake’s gaping fangs, and the meaning that expression bore amongsnakes, a promise that whoever beheld the teeth was to be consumed bythem. “Wasste not time in thoughtss of esscape, if you care for thosse oness. You havessixty ssecondss to begin telling me ssomething I wissh to know, and then your deathbeginss.”1816 *he gibbous moon riding higher in the cloudless sky, the stars andwash of the Milky Way visible in all their majesty within the darkness, all these shone down upon the graveyard to bear witness from theirunimaginable distances.In the instant when Harry had realised there was no way at all left tosave everyone, his mind’s voices had fallen away, become one, a singlepurpose taking up every fraction of his mind.Fifty seconds.Forty seconds.Harry’s eyes tracked slowly across the air, until his gaze landed on thefirst Death Eater, the one closest to him.Thirty seconds?Twenty seconds?“Time'ss almosst up—” hissed Voldemort.“I do know ssecretss you would like to know,” Harry hissed. He didn’t lookdirectly at the Dark Lord as he spoke. “But mosst valuable knowledge to you, Ithink, would be my ideass ass to how world might be desstroyed. Yet, to tell you ssuchthoughtss might lead to desstruction of world. Do not know prophecy, but if there issprophecy, that makess it more than ussually probable that any action I take mighthave that effect. Or to tell you ssuch might prevent desstruction of world, ssince youdo sseem motivated to avoid it. Not allowed to make ssuch a decission mysself. Wouldneed to awaken and conssult girl-child friend. Vow requiress.”There was a long pause. The Dark Lord, floating above and behindthe curve of Death Eaters with leveled wands, began to laugh as Salazar1817 *Slytherin had thought a snake would laugh, cold amusement in the formof a hiss. “Do you know how to desstroy world, then?”“Cannot deliberately try to imagine method. You might have way for sservant tossteal my thoughtss. Vow prohibitss. But ssusspect I could devisse method, if girl-childssaid to try.”Harry’s eyes drifted slowly to another Death Eater, and another.More snakish laughter. “Clever. You have my complimentss for thinking ofssuch tacticss. But no.”“Know it iss annoying, but with world and your eternity at sstake, would younot—”“Greater rissk to world in introducing ssuch complicationss, delaying your end. Iwill sstudy Muggle ssciencess mysself, think of all you might imagine. Now sspeakssuch ssecretss as you may tell me, or thiss endss.”Slowly Harry’s vision tracked across the graveyard in careful arcs,ignoring the Dark Lord except as a floating blackness in his peripheralvision. His mouth went on speaking with only half his attention. “Havethought of idea you might not have conssidered, teacher. Your attempt to kill memight fail in certain sspeciﬁc way desspite all your precautionss, perhapss lead intomy desstroying world later. Would not ordinarily deem probable, but with prophecyat hand, may well be sso.”Voldemort went still, in the air. “How?”“Am not obligated to tell you.”A cold anger began to seethe through the snakish reply. “Though I undersstand well your dessperation and attempted clevernesss, thiss beginss to annoyme. I will not withhold from killing you, for that iss sstill greater rissk. To fail to tellme your thought rissks desstroying world. Sspeak!”“No. Vow doess not obligate me to any possitive action.”The Dark Lord stared down at Harry Potter, who glanced up at theangry face only briefly before his eyes went back to the next Death Eater.Some of them were shifting their stances slightly, but they stood still, andsaid no words as they leveled their wands. The silver skull masks couldnot be read.Then the Dark Lord began to chuckle again. “Ssurvive your death, youthink you might? No, child, my horcruxess are not linked to you alsso. I would knowif they were. Or iss there other reasson you think you might ssurvive beyond my waysof enssuring your death?”Harry didn’t allow himself to be distracted. The repeated failuresdidn’t matter, they only led into the next action in the chain—but he stillneeded a next action—“Now sspeak a ssecret,” the Dark Lord hissed, “or I—”“Life-eaterss will purssue you alwayss, hate you alwayss, sseek you out whereveryou go, if what I have jusst done wass ssuccesssful, I have caused them to be set uponyou! Guardian Charm ssecret will be beyond you for long time to come, perhapss forever! Besst defensse againsst life-eaterss would die with me!”“Thiss iss sstarting to become ssad…” the Dark Lord’s voice trailed off. “Ah.I ssee. Life-eaterss resspond to expectationss. You tell me I will be hunted, I expect tobe hunted, they hunt me. Ssuch iss rare, but not unheard-of. Valuable ssecret, yess.Can ssee many ussess.” A cruel smile. “I sshall allow you to sselect one persson to bessaved.”“Mysself.”“Would tell you to die with dignity, but knowing mysself, I know it for futility. Youhave wassted my kindly gift jusst then by annoying me, and I retract it. Any otherssecretss?”“Yess. Really interessting oness, too. Ssome you are unlikely to ﬁgure out on yourown, not for very long time if ever. If I ssay I have told you all that do not rissk world,will you not torment any of my friendss or family? All of thiss sspeech sstarted becausseyou left me no way at all to ssave everyone.”The Dark Lord stood still in the air for a long moment.And Harry’s eyes went on tracking slowly across the graveyard, as hishand remained tight upon his wand.In the instant when Harry had realized there was no way left to saveeveryone—He couldn’t speak any incantation in English. But Transfigurationwas wordless.There was no material in contact with his wand’s end except air,which couldn’t be Transfigured. But Voldemort didn’t know about partial Transfiguration, which Harry could use to Transfigure a tiny bit ofthe material from his wand itself.“You're sstalling,” the Dark Lord said. “Jusst to delay death? Or with otherpurposse?”Harry said nothing, his other work slowing as his mind sought acontinuation of the conversation that would work even against the DarkLord’s will—“Sspeak and tell me purposse, or thiss endss now and your friendss suffer for lifetimess!”“Lower Muggle weapon and do not point wand in my direction,” Harry hissed,putting as much cold danger as he could into the snake’s voice. “Sspeak nocommandss to sservantss. I do posssesss capabilitiess of which you are ignorant. Canusse one ssuch capacity to causse huge explossion almosst insstantly, without sspeaking incantation. Sslay your new body, all sservantss, Sstone sscattered to who knowsswhere.”At his current level of practice Harry could Transfigure one cubic millimeter as fast as he could apply his will and magic.One cubic millimeter of antimatter.It wasn’t a world-ending threat.Voldemort could have been carved from stone. “You bluff, ssomehow.”“Not blufﬁng. Sspeaking in ssnaketalk, I tell you, I can do it almosst insstantly,before any sspell can be casst at me, I think. You know very little of sscience ass yet.Power I would command iss sstronger than processs that fuelss sstarss.”“Vow will sstop you,” hissed Voldemort. “You cannot rissk world. Take no risskss, none, with clever ideass!”“Would not rissk world. I esstimated ssize of explossion, nowhere near thatlarge.”“You do NOT know, fool! Cannot be SURE!” Voldemort’s hiss was climbinghigher.“I am reassonably certain. Vow will not sstop me.”There was an increasing fury in Voldemort’s expression, and yet hishiss carried a tinge of fear. “I sshall wreak pain beyond imagining on all you carefor—”“Sshut up. I dissregard all ssuch threatss now, as theory of gamess ssayss Isshould. Only reasson you make threatss iss that you expect me to resspond.” That,too, Harry had truly understood in the last extremity. “Offer me ssomethingI want, teacher. For your new body, for your continued holding of Sstone, for livess ofyour sservantss.”Harry’s mouth was running on automatic, his real attention elsewhere.Beneath the moonlight glints a tiny fragment of silver, a fraction of a line…From a tiny spot on the end of Harry’s wand, a cubic millimeter ofanchor, stretched out a thin line of Transfigured spider-silk. It wouldhave broken at once, if tested; it would have gone unremarked, if any hadnoticed its glint. Less than a tenth of a millimeter in cross-section, thetiny shape represented by the extended line of spider-silk was somethingHarry could Transfigure swiftly, ten centimeters of length to a cubic millimeter of total volume; and Harry could Transfigure a cubic millimeterin a fraction of a second. He was forcing the Transfiguration outward,extending it through the air as fast as he could without risking the transformation.The tracing line of spider-silk looped around a Death Eater’s hood atneck level, returned to the pattern of threads.Voldemort’s face was now impassive. “You musst not leave here alive.Ssenssible people called good would alsso agree, thiss I tell you in ssnake'ss sspeech.But all your friendss I will treat kindly and protect under my reign, if you agree to dienow ass good persson sshould.”The last Death Eater was looped. The pattern of spider-silk was complete. The web had been drawn with loops around all the Death Eater’snecks. The ends of those loops had been anchored to a central circle; andthat central circle in turn had three threads stretching across its center.The entire pattern still touching the anchor-line stretching out of Harry’swand.Over the next seconds, those near-invisible threads of reflected moonlight turned black.Filaments narrower, stronger, and sharper than steel wire; braidedcarbon nanotubes, each individual tube all a single molecule.Harry hissed, “Want you to alsso promisse to treat nationss kindly under yourrule. Will not accept lesss.”Voldemort hovered still in the air, snake-face showing a dawningfury.1821 *The last two threads stretched out from the dark pattern, black theadsalready in the form of nanotubes. They moved lightly through the air toward the Dark Lord himself, toward the sleeve just above Voldemort’s lefthand that held the gun, toward the sleeve above the right hand that heldthe yew wand, threads placed high at first to give them time to drift slowlydownward through the air. The threads looped around, went over themselves, tied slippable knots. Began to tighten, coming closer to the sleeve,as Harry Transfigured them shorter—Harry felt the tickle of Voldmort’s power beginning to touch his ownin the back of his mind; at the same time the Dark Lord’s eyes widened,his mouth opened.And Harry Transfigured the black threads stretching across the blackpattern’s center to a quarter their previous size, shrinking the circle, yanking hard on everything attached, tightening loops.(Black robes, falling.)Harry wasn’t looking there, he didn’t see the falling masks, the blood,in the back of his mind he felt some explosions of magic like he’d feltwhen Hermione died but he ignored them, Harry’s eyes only saw the DarkLord’s hands and wand and gun dropping downward, and then Harry’swand was rising, pointing—Harry screamed, “STUPORFY!”The red bolt the color of the Stunning Hex winged toward Voldemort,blazing across the graveyard almost faster than the eye could see.Without any hesitation despite his wounds the Dark Lord jerkeddown and right through the air.And the red bolt from Professor Flitwick’s secret Swerving Stunnerturned in midair and slammed into Voldemort.The pain that flashed through Harry’s scar was searing, it made himcry out and a red haze appear across his vision, despite everything Harrydropped his wand in pain and sheer fatigue.As Harry let go of his wand, the pain began to clear—omething like a fugue state had come over Harry’s mind. The absolutestate had partially worn off him, partially stayed with him. Elementsof his mind were numb, maybe deliberately numbed by some part thatwas smart enough to predict what would happen otherwise. What he’djust done—The thought was shut off, making space for an awareness of otherthings.Harry was standing in the middle of a haphazard graveyard, tombstones scattered without order.By moonlight and starlight, it could be seen that black robes litteredthe ground, surrounded by textures that didn’t match the surroundinggraveyard earth, wetness tinged red in the moonlight. Some heads hadcome loose from the surrounding hoods of the robes, revealing hair thatwas long or short, dark or bright, which was all that could be seen beneaththe moon. The silver masks stayed on, making all the hair originate inskulls instead of human faces—The thought was shut off, making space for awareness of other things.A girl in a red-trimmed Hogwarts uniform slept upon an altar. Nearthe altar, Harry’s things lay in a heap.Upon the ground lay a too-tall pale man of inhuman face, blood pouring from the stumps of his wrists.As soon as the Dark Lord Voldemort awakens, he will destroy everything youlove. Dumbledore is no longer there to stop him.He cannot be imprisoned, for he can abandon his body at any time.He cannot be killed permanently, not without destroying more than a hundredhorcruxes, one of which is the Pioneer plaque.Materials: One wand, you are allowed to point it and speak this time.You have five minutes.Solve.Harry stumbled toward the altar, knelt at its side, and picked up hispouch.He walked toward where Voldemort lay.The sense of apprehension had diminished, after Voldemort had beenhexed unconscious. Now, as Harry approached, it rose to a terrifyingheight, flaring also into pain in his scar.Harry ignored the inner shriek. That had been the last memory ofTom Riddle seared into Harry’s brain, the last cognitive pattern to betransferred over into the infant baby before Tom Riddle had exploded: asense of mounting horror and dismay associated with the resonance thathad spun out of control. Harry knew the meaning of it now, that senseof apprehension, and that made it easier to disregard. He’d guessed thatthe effect of the resonance mostly hit the caster, with power proportionalto the caster’s power, and the bet had paid off.Harry looked upon Voldemort’s body, and breathed deeply—throughhis mouth, because coppery smells Harry was not thinking about werecoming in through his nose.Harry knelt by Voldemort’s side, took out his medical kit from hispouch, and placed a self-tightening tourniquet around the body’s leftwrist, then another tourniquet about the right.It felt wrong, showing Voldemort that concern. Some part of Harrywas aware, in the back of his mind, that some number of people had justhad something extremely bad happen to them. What would have beenbalance, what would have been justice, was if Voldemort had sufferedthe same fate without an instant’s more hesitation. What Harry was doing now felt like Batman showing more concern for the Joker than forthe Joker’s victims; it felt like a comic book where the writers wrung theirhands endlessly about the morality of killing the Big Named Villains whileinnocents went on dying in the background. To show more solicitous* 1824 *ness for the head villain than his minions, to pay more attention to his fatethan the fates of his lower-status followers, was a flaw in human nature.So it felt wrong when Harry rose up from beside the body, the tourniquets having tightened upon Voldemort’s wrists; it felt like Harry wasdoing something ethically monstrous.Even though any sane strategic thinking said that Voldemort’s bodymust not die. The soul he’d created for himself had to be anchored in thisbrain, it mustn’t be allowed to float free.Harry stepped back, back from Voldemort’s unconscious body,breathing deeply through his mouth. He went to the pile of his things, toput on his robes and other items, starting with placing the Time-Turneraround his throat once more, readying his own escape and return if thatwas required…More than a hundred horcruxes.That had been insane, there wasn’t any other word for it, a sign ofVoldemort’s damaged thinking about death. A Muggle security expertwould have called it fence-post security, like building a fence-post over ahundred metres high in the middle of the desert. Only a very obliging attacker would try to climb the fence-post. Anyone sensible would just walkaround the fence-post, and making the fence-post even higher wouldn’tstop that.Once you forgot to be scared of how impossible the problem was supposed to be, it wasn’t even difficult, not by comparison to the last one.Neville’s parents, for example, had been Crucioed into permanent insanity. Two hundred advanced horcruxes wouldn’t prevent that insanity,they would all just echo the same damaged mind.It would be an ethically justified use of the Cruciatus Curse, if thatwere the only way to stop Voldemort permanently. It would be justice,balance, it would show that the Joker’s life wasn’t worth more than hismeanest henchman…All Harry needed to do was cast the Patronus Charm, send it to… Alastor Moody?… and tell him to come here. Well, no, it was a pretty goodguess the Patronus Charm wouldn’t work if it was cast with that intent.Maybe just resolve to tell Moody that, and use his Time-Turner once hewas out of range of Voldemort’s wards.And then Voldemort could be Crucioed into permanent insanity.It wasn’t even the least merciful fate. That would have been throwingVoldemort’s wand into the pit at Azkaban, if the wand stayed connectedto Voldemort’s life and magic no matter where his ghost tried to flee.Harry turned to face where Voldemort lay. He walked forward, andcontinued to control his breathing, ignoring the burning feeling in histhroat. Some part of him knew that Voldemort was also Professor Quirrell, even though his body now was different. Even though the shift ofpersonality had been perfect and that meant that Professor Quirrell hadbeen just another mask…Though Voldemort hadn’t planned to kill Harry painfully. Hadn’tthought to strike Harry with his followers’ Cruciatus, when Harry wasbeing annoying before. That meant something, when your opponentwas Voldemort. Maybe he’d had some remaining shred of fellow-feelingfor the other Tom Riddle after all.…it would be wrong to take that into account.Wouldn’t it?Harry looked back up at the stars. Here below the atmosphere thestars twinkled, they were embedded in the false dome of the night sky,stretched out across the wash of the Milky Way that glowed like a longribbon, as if they were all close enough that you could fly up to them on abroomstick and touch them.What would they want him to do now at this juncture, the children’schildren’s children?The answer to that also felt obvious, if it wasn’t just the part of Harrythat still cared about Professor Quirrell doing the real talking.Harry had needed to do the thing he’d done, it had prevented greaterevils, Harry couldn’t have stopped Voldemort if the Death Eaters hadfired first. But that thing Harry had done wasn’t something that couldbe balanced by a not-necessary tragedy happening to one more sentientbeing, even if that being was Voldemort. It would just be one moreelement of the sorrows of ancient Earth so long ago.The past was past. You did what you had to do, and you didn’t do onescrap of harm more than that. Not even to balance things out, and makeit all symmetrical.The children’s children’s children wouldn’t want Voldemort to die,even if his minions had. They wouldn’t want Voldemort to hurt, if itdidn’t accomplish anything compared to him not hurting.Harry breathed deeply, and let go of—not his hate—not quite hishate—he hadn’t been able to hate his creator even at the very end—buteven so, Harry let go of something. Of the sense that he ought to hateVoldemort, that it was a hate he was obligated to feel, for the endless listof crimes that Voldemort had committed for no good reason, not evenhis own happiness…It’s all right, the stars whispered down at him. It’s all right not to hatehim. It doesn’t make you a bad person.In the end, there was only one option he would take, and since Harryalready knew that, there was no point agonizing about it. Whether it wasthe best option, only time would tell.Harry breathed deeply, building up the magic inside himself. Thespell he was going to cast didn’t need to be precise, but it was still one ofthe most powerful spells he’d mastered.Harry thought again of how unjust it was that Voldemort could notdie with his followers, felt the slight trace of coldness in his blood thatcame with thoughts of ruthlessness. And then Harry let it go, let it alldrain away beneath the starlight, because his dark side had never beenanything except an inherited pattern of cognition, just one more badhabit of thinking to break.Instead Harry looked at Hermione’s breathing form atop the altar,and let the tears finally start from his eyes. What would become of Hermione now, what path she would choose after this, Harry couldn’t guess;but she would be there to have a choice, their friendship wouldn’t have destroyed her existence. He hadn’t realised how shaky his hope had been,until he’d noticed how surprised he’d been after the hope had come true.Sometimes things did go better than expected.And Harry took that thought, too, and put it into the magic he wasbuilding.The power he was storing up was vibrating in him, like his whole bodywas part of his wand, either Harry’s eyes were blurring or there was aluminous white quiver running over the holly. And Harry thought theshape of the spell he would cast, he didn’t have much fine control but thepattern he needed was simple, it just needed to include—Everything, forget everything, Tom Riddle, Professor Quirrell, forget yourwhole life, forget your entire episodic memory, forget the disappointment and thebitterness and the wrong decisions, forget Voldemort—And at the last moment before Harry cast the spell, he had one finalthought, a note of grace—But if you ever had any truly happy memories, not hurting people or laughing at their pain, but the warm feeling of helping someone or being helped, therewon’t be many, maybe just when you were a child, but if you had any truly happymemories then keep only those—Something bright in him unfolded at the decision, knowing he’dmade the right choice, and Harry pushed that too into his wand—And it all poured out of Harry into the spell.Harry fell over on his side, dropping his wand, gritted screams coming from his throat, his hands going helplessly to his scar, even as the sudden blast of pain in his head began to fade. Only dimly did his eyes seethat the air was filled with glowing snowflakes, drifting motes of silverlight like tiny specks of Patronus Charm.Only a moment the silver light lasted, and then it was gone.Professor Quirrell was gone.Nothing left but a remnant.And that spirit, what remained of it, wouldn’t be so different nowfrom Harry’s own.The Prophecy was complete.They had each remade the other in their own image.Harry started sobbing, then, from where he was curled up in the dirt.He cried for a while.And then eventually Harry staggered to his feet and picked up hiswand again, because this day’s work wasn’t quite done.Harry laid his wand directly on Voldemort’s wrist-stump; it made his scarthrob with an ongoing pain, but neither of them exploded.And Harry began a Transfiguration.Slowly—though faster than Harry had been able to Transfigure Hermione’s body, last time—the stunned form of the snake-man changed, reshaped itself. As the Transfiguration progressed, especially as the snakeman’s head began to turn glassy and shrunken, the pain in Harry’s scarfaded.It would be a spell to maintain whether Harry was waking or sleeping;and later, when Harry was older and more powerful and maybe had somehelp, he would un-Transfigure the mindwiped Tom Riddle and heal hisbody with the power of the Stone. After future-Harry had figured out whatto do with an almost-completely-amnesiac wizard who still had some badhabits of thought and some highly negative emotional patterns—a darkside, as ’twere—plus a great deal of declarative and procedural knowledgeabout powerful magic. Harry had tried his best not to Obliviate that part,because he might need it, someday.And meanwhile, just like magic hadn’t defined a Transfigured unicorn as dead for purposes of setting off wards, Voldemort’s horcruxeswouldn’t define a Transfigured Voldemort as dead and try to bring himback.That was the hope, anyway.Harry’s scar twinged one last time when the steel ring went on hispinky finger, holding the tiny green emerald in contact with his skin.Then his scar subsided, and did not hurt again.An upthrust rock served Harry for a chair, when he staggered overit and sat down motionless, resting after a fashion, shoving back the exhaustion that threatened the corners of his mind. It was not done, there wasmore to do.Harry took another deep breath, still inhaling through his mouth, said“Lumos,” and looked around the graveyard.Black robes and severed skull masks, surrounded by pools of blood—Hermione Granger, asleep on an altar.Voldemort’s empty robes and bloody hands, lying where the DarkLord had fallen.Quirinus Quirrell with his shredded robes, fallen in a heap where theKilling Curse had stricken him.Harry imagined someone else looking at this scene, trying to understand it, and shook his head, because that wouldn’t do, it wouldn’t do atall.Then Harry shoved himself up from his rock, grimacing as his mind,if not body, protested. He hadn’t been bloodied or beaten much today,but somehow Harry’s body was managing to feel like all the stress had hitit directly.Harry staggered over toward where Voldemort had fallen, and pickedup Voldemort’s left hand from where it lay upon the ground.Even in just the left hand, you could see the faint trace of snake’sscales; it was very distinctively Voldemort. That was good.Harry went to the altar where the sleeping Hermione lay, and gentlyplaced the detached hand around Hermione’s neck, carefully moving thefingers to clutch at her throat. It was hard to do, Hermione seemed sopeaceful and innocent when she was sleeping, and Voldemort’s severedhand seemed so ugly; Harry bluntly overrode whatever part of his mindwas thinking that, since it made no sense in context.A few weak Severing Charms served to mess up the almost perfectlyfine cut the nanofiber had made, which was critical; it would not do tohave the hand-stump look like the neck-stumps. The multiple Diffindosscattered small bits of Voldemort-wrist all over Hermione’s shirt, which,Harry had to remind himself, was also part of the plan.Harry repeated this with the right hand, arranging it symmetricallywith the left.Harry used Inflammare to singe Voldemort’s robes where they lay, andthen arranged the singed clothing around Hermione.Voldemort’s gun, and his wand, went into Harry’s pouch. Harryplaced the Stone of Permanency in an ordinary pocket, he wasn’t surewhat the Stone might do to his pouch.The heap of things from inside Quirrell’s robe, also near the altar,yielded the wand that the Defense Professor had used when he was beingQuirrell. Harry went to where Quirrell lay, and straightened out the bodyas best he could, and put Quirrell’s wand into his hand. Tears predictablycame to Harry’s eyes, and Harry wiped them away on his sleeve.Harry took another deep breath, still inhaling through his mouth, said“Lumos” again, and once more looked around the graveyard.Black robes, severed skull masks, and Hermione Granger lying on analtar with Voldemort’s severed hands clutched around her throat, andVoldemort’s singed clothing scattered around her. Quirinus Quirrell laydead with his clothes torn and shredded, his wand in his right hand.That would do.There remained the problem of calling attention to it.Harry was very nearly out of magic at this point. But he still hadenough left to Transfigure a leaf into the deflated form of a three-meterweather balloon.Harry’s pouch produced a bottle of oxyacetelene, and a stick of dynamite, and a spool of fuse-cord. Be prepared, that’s the Boy Scout’s marchingsong, be prepared for a life that includes mountain trolls and who knows whatelse…Harry inflated the weather balloon with the oxyacetelene. That wouldproduce a very sharp overpressure when it detonated, maybe as loud as asonic boom.He attached the stick of dynamite—it was overkill, for detonation, butit would do.He attached a 60-second fuse to the stick of dynamite, but did notlight it yet.Harry put on his Cloak of Invisibility, that had been among the pilesby the sacrificial altar.He obtained his broomstick from his pouch, and mounted it.Harry cast a Quieting Charm around Hermione Granger—it wouldn’tstop all the noise, not even close, and it wasn’t like she’d be permanentlyhurt if her eardrums burst, but it still seemed polite.And then that was it. The Quieting Charm had done it. Harry wasdrained of magic for at least the next hour.Harry mounted the broomstick, slowly rising into the air, lifting theweather balloon filled with oxyacetelene with him. The castle Hogwartscame into view, distantly gleaming in moonlight a few kilometers away,1831 *as Harry rose above the trees; and Harry did his best to figure the distance,and the angle as it would be seen from Hogwarts.When he had risen high above the forest, Harry used a lighter to ignite the fuse on the dynamite attached to the weather balloon full of oxyacetelene. Then Harry spun the broomstick and darted away—thoughnot directly toward the castle, that might take him too close to the routepast-Harry and Professor Quirrell had traversed, it wouldn’t do to havethe Professor sense another Harry—Harry felt a leaden stab of sadness, and refused it.Thirty-one one-thousand, thirty-two one-thousand, thirty-three one-thousand…When Harry reached forty, not wanting to take chances with his owneardrums, he glanced at his wristwatch, noting the exact time, and spunhis Time-Turner once.t first Anna had been gratified to see the final Quidditch Cup go on solong—as a Gryffindor she was a bystander at the House Cup thing,it wasn’t like Gryffindor ever won. In contrast, last year’s World Cupof Quidditch, to which her family had bought some very expensive tickets, had been over in ten minutes which was awful. Modern Quidditchgames had become too short, the Snitch caught much too quickly. Itwas a widely-talked problem among aficionados: broomstick enchantments had advanced, while the Snitch stayed the same regulation speed,with the result that Quidditch games had become shorter and shorter. Atprofessional levels the sport of Quidditch had been reduced to a contestof who had the deepest pockets for their Seeker’s experimental racingbroom, and the rest of the players might as well have been watching fromthe stands.Everyone knew something had to be done, the situation had been getting worse for centuries and now it was intolerable. But the InternationalConfederation of Wizards’ Quidditch Committee was mired in all theusual acrimony of the I.C.W., screaming disputes between Germans andBulgarians, and somehow nobody could agree on exactly how to fix therules. To Anna the correct course seemed obvious, just make the Snitchfast enough to restore the four-hour or five-hour games of the early nineteenth century and the Golden Age of Quidditch. Except the Belgiansthought the duration of a professional game should be two hours like inLa Belle Époque when Belgium had dominated Quidditch, and the lunaticItalians wanted to go back to the week-long Quidditch games of the fourteenth century, and Britain’s even crazier blood purists kept on talkingup the occasional day-long Quidditch match as proof that broomstickscouldn’t really have improved since everything was better in the old dayswhich was not how the Interdict of Merlin worked.She was one hundred percent on the side of Harry Potter that it wastime for Hogwarts to give up on those gibbering slowpokes and justchange the rules, starting here and now. But not by eliminating the Snitch,that was going all the way back to eleventh century Kwidditch. It didn’tmatter if Headmistress Hufflepuff had first introduced the innovationbecause one of her students had wanted to play the game but not beensuited to the usual roles. Snitches had caught on internationally becauseit was more exciting when the game could always end in the next minute.Anna had been arguing this viewpoint at the top of her lungs for thelast thirty minutes, quite forgetting to pay attention to the game. Thanksto a lucky coincidence of seating she’d been near the Boy-Who-Lived andhis sign, and hence she’d managed to stake out her position right fromthe start.She was aware, in the back of her mind, that if the Quidditch rules really did change starting here and now, then this was the most importantthing she’d ever do. She could almost feel the pressure of Time twistingaround her as though the fate of Quidditch Itself were being settled thisvery day, and she was standing close to the center of it… though she hadn’tgotten high-enough scores in Divination to actually sense anything likethat, of course.She hardly noticed when at one point the Boy-Who-Lived stood up togo to the bathroom.The Boy-Who-Lived did catch her eye when he trudged back; HarryPotter looked a bit tired and wobbly, though his uniform appeared as trimas if he’d just changed into a new one.She noticed half an hour later on, when Harry Potter seemed to swaya bit, and then hunch over, his hands going to cover up his forehead; itlooked like he was prodding at his forehead scar. The thought made herslightly worried; everyone knew there was something going on with HarryPotter, and if Potter’s scar was hurting him then it was possible that asealed horror was about to burst out of his forehead and eat everyone.She dismissed that thought, though, and continued to explain Quidditchfacts to the historically ignorant at the top of her lungs.She definitely noticed when Harry Potter stood up, hands still on hisforehead, and dropped his hands to reveal that his famous lightning-boltscar was now blazing red and inflamed. It was bleeding, with the blooddripping down Potter’s nose.She stopped talking mid-sentence. Other people turned to look atwhat she was staring at.“Professor McGonagall?” Harry Potter said in a wavering voice. Therewere tears in the corners of his eyes, which shocked her; the Boy-WhoLived did not seem like the sort of person who would burst into tears.Harry Potter raised his voice further, as though it were hard for him tospeak. “Um, Professor McGonagall?”Professor McGonagall turned away from where she was arguing withthe Hufflepuff Quidditch team. The Head of Gryffindor’s eyes widenedin shock, and then she was moving people out of her way, almost running.“Harry!” she said. “Your scar!”Silence was spreading, in a widening circle.“I think,” Harry said, his voice still wavering but louder, “I think he’sback. I think I’m seeing—through Voldemort’s mind—”Anna took a step back at You-Know-Who’s name and nearly fell overa bleacher. An older boy standing next to her gave a cry of dismay, andthen the Boy-Who-Lived shrieked even louder.“HE’S KILLING THEM!” screamed Harry Potter.Half the Quidditch stadium turned to look at him.“The ritual!” cried Harry Potter. “Blood of his servants! The blood,the life! He summoned them, he took their heads, their blood, the life, torenew his own—THE DARK LORD RISES, VOLDEMORT IS RETURNED!”Madam Hooch blew a shrill whistle, and the Quidditch brooms thathadn’t already stopped in midair began to slow. For herself she wasn’tsure if this was a joke; if it was, Boy-Who-Lived or not, he was in moretrouble than she could even imagine.Professor McGonagall raised her wand into position for a QuietingCharm and Harry Potter caught her hand.“Wait—” Harry Potter gasped, his voice lower, but still loud enoughthat she and the people near her could hear clearly. “He can be stopped—I see his mind, his mistake—he can be stopped now—THE WAY ISHarry’s voice rose further, as Anna’s own mouth fell open in sudden confusion. “RETURN! RETURN, RETURN, REVIVE AND STOP HIM! STOPAnd then Harry Potter fell silent. He looked around at the people staring at him.She’d just about decided that this had to all be a prank in unbelievablypoor taste, when a distant but sharp CRACK filled the air.Harry Potter swayed, and fell to his knees, even as her heart jumpedinto her throat. An explosion of excited babble rose around them.She could still hear the words from Harry Potter’s mouth, as ProfessorMcGonagall knelt next to him. “It worked,” Harry Potter gasped aloud,“she got him, he’s gone.”“What?” cried Professor McGonagall, then glanced around. “Quiet!Quiet, all of you! Harry, what happened?”Harry Potter was speaking rapidly but loudly. “Voldemort—tried torevive—he summoned Death Eaters and he killed them, stole their bloodand life—Hermione’s body was there, I don’t know why, maybe Voldemort was planning to use it for something—Voldemort came back, heresurrected himself, but Hermione followed him back and she destroyed him,he’s gone, it’s over. It happened in a graveyard near Hogwarts, it’s,” HarryPotter rose to his feet, still swaying, “I think it’s in that direction.” HarryPotter pointed in the rough direction the CRACK had come from, “I’mnot sure how far. The sound from there took twenty seconds to get here,so maybe two minutes on a broomstick—”With a motion so smooth it looked unconscious, Professor McGonagall shifted into a stance and said “Expecto Patronum.” She addressed theglowing cat that then appeared. “Go to Albus, tell him he must come atonce—”“Dumbledore’s gone!” cried Harry Potter. “The Headmaster is gone,Professor McGonagall! The Dark Lord trapped him, he reversed somekind of trap the Headmaster planned and Dumbledore was caught outside Time, he’s gone!”The horrified babble around them rose in pitch.“Go to Albus!” Professor McGonagall said to her Patronus.The moonlit cat only looked at McGonagall sadly, and Anna sucked inher breath in sudden horror, feeling like someone had punched her in thestomach. It was real, it was all real, this wasn’t a joke.“Professor McGonagall, Hermione is alive!” Harry Potter raised hisvoice again. “She’s really alive and not an Inferius or anything, and she’sstill there in the graveyard!”“A broomstick!” Professor McGonagall shouted. She turned to the players hovering motionless over the Quidditch field. “I need a broomstick.Despite everything, Anna raised a hand in mute protest, then caughtherself, even as the Ravenclaw and Slytherin Seekers came zoomingover (with excellent strategic sense, since they weren’t actually doinganything).Harry Potter was already retrieving another broomstick from hispouch, a multi-person one.Professor McGonagall saw this, and nodded firmly. “You stay here,Mr. Potter, unless there is some excellent reason you must be there. I willgo at once.”“You mustn’t!” squeaked Professor Flitwick, who’d shoved his tinyway through the crowd, occasionally running under someone’s legs. Hiseyes were wide, he looked as though he wanted to faint. “You have to stayat Hogwarts, Minerva! You—you’re the—” Professor Flitwick seemed tobe having trouble speaking.Professor McGonagall spun around to face Professor Flitwick, andthen stopped, blood draining from her face.Then she seized the broomstick from Harry Potter’s hand, and presented it to the tiny half-goblin Professor. “Filius,” she said crisply. Allthe incipient panic had disappeared from her voice, she now spoke in hercrisp Scottish accent as though addressing lessons on Monday. “Look forthe graveyard of which Mr. Potter spoke, find Miss Granger. Apparateher to St. Mungo’s and then stay by her.”“I think—” Harry Potter said hoarsely. “I think Transfigurationmight have been used in combat there—Professor Quirrell tried to fightVoldemort—take precautions—”Filius Flitwick nodded without halting in getting on the broomstick.“Professor Quirrell’s dead!” wailed Harry Potter. The anguish in hisvoice carried clearly. “He’s dead! The Dark Lord killed him! His body—”Harry Potter choked up. “It’s there, in the graveyard.”She stumbled back again, feeling it like another punch in her gut. Professor Quirrell had been—one of her favorite Professors, ever, he’d madeher rethink everything she’d believed about Slytherin, she’d known insome distant way that he was probably going to die very soon but to hearthat he was really, truly dead…The Boy-Who-Lived sat down on the bench, as if his legs couldn’t support him anymore.Professor McGonagall turned to the crowd, touching her wand to herthroat. “QUIDDITCH IS OVER,” her amplified voice boomed out. “GO“Don’t!” screamed Harry Potter.Professor McGonagall turned to look at him.Tears were leaking down the Boy-Who-Lived’s cheeks, he looked likethe interruption had surprised himself as much as it had surprised anyone else. “It was Professor Quirrell’s last plot,” Harry Potter said, his voicebreaking. The Boy-Who-Lived looked at the Quidditch players who hadnow flown to nearby, as though speaking to them directly. “His last plot.”Harry Potter was floated off by Professor McGonagall to the infirmary.The other Professors ran off to oversee who-knew-what, leaving only Professors Sinistra and Hooch behind. At the stadium, rumors ran wild;Anna repeated everything she could remember hearing as best she could.Something had happened to Dumbledore, some Death Eaters had beensummoned and killed (no, Harry Potter hadn’t said which ones), Professor Quirrell had gone out to face the Dark Lord and died for it, You-KnowWho had returned and died again, Professor Quirrell was dead, he wasdead.In time most of the students wandered off back to their dormitories,to sleep if they could.Anna stayed in the stadium, and watched the rest of the game, ignoring her body’s need for sleep, and her eyes that often blurred with tears.The Ravenclaw team put up a valiant fight.But there was no Quidditch team anywhere that could’ve defeated theSlytherins that day.Dawn was tinging the sky when the Slytherins won their final game,the Quidditch Cup, and the House Cup.morning after had come, and all the students had gatheredThesilentlyaround the four Tables of Hogwarts, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres among them. He had collapsed in exhaustion last nightand been awoken in the infirmary next morning, still muzzy, with thePhilosopher’s Stone underneath his left sock.The Head Table looked like a plague had swept it.Dumbledore’s throne was gone from the Head Table, without replacement, leaving the center of the Head Table empty.Severus Snape was sitting in a floating seat, the magical equivalent ofa wheelchair.Professor Sprout was missing. According to what Harry had been toldlast night, a court Legilimens would examine her to see if any furthercompulsions remained, but probably no charges would be filed. Harryhad emphasized to Professor McGonagall and the Aurors, as hard as hecould, that Professor Sprout was probably just a victim. The Boy-WhoLived had pronounced that he’d seen no evidence of Sprout’s intentionalguilt in Voldemort’s mind.Professor Flitwick was missing, presumably still staying by Hermione’s side.Professor Sinistra was missing and Harry didn’t know why or where.The numbness that surrounded Harry’s mind was like a Mylar blanket, protective if not comforting. There were scenes in his mind of black1841 *robes falling and blood spilling, appearing for an instant before beingshoved back. He’d process it later, not now. Some other time would bebetter, future-Harry would have a comparative advantage at coping.Somewhere inside Harry was the fear that it wouldn’t hurt, that therewould be no price to be paid. But that fear also could be put off into thefuture.No breakfast had appeared on the tables. The students sitting nearHarry were waiting in frightened silence. Owls had been prohibited fromentering or leaving Hogwarts since early last night.The doors of the Great Hall opened once more, and forth came DeputyHeadmistress Minerva McGonagall. She wore robes of formal black, andher head was bare, denuded of its usual witch’s hat. Her grey-brownblonde hair was done up in a coiled braid, as if in preparation for a hatto be placed later; but for now Harry saw her head bare for the first time.Minerva McGonagall came to the lectern that stood before the HeadTable.All eyes were upon her.“I am afraid that I have much news,” Minerva said. Her voice wassad, within its Scottish precision. “And most of it is terrible. First. Thereason I am the one to speak to you is that the Headmaster of Hogwarts,Albus,” her voice stopped, “Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, has beenlost. You-Know-Who trapped him outside Time, and we do not know ifhe ever can be brought back to us. We, we have lost, what may have been,the greatest Headmaster, that Hogwarts has ever had.”A susurration of horror arose across the tables, no audible gasps ormoans, just the sound of many intaken breaths; most from Gryffindor,and some from Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw as well. The ill news had already been known, but now it had also been said by authority.“Second. You-Know-Who returned briefly, but is once again dead.All that remained of him was his hands clutched around Miss Granger’sthroat. There is no more threat from him, or so we think.” MinervaMcGonagall drew in another breath. “Third. Professor Quirrell diedwith his wand in his hand, facing You-Know-Who. He was found notfar from where You-Know-Who perished again, a victim of You-Know* 1842 *Who’s Killing Curse.” Another susurration of verified horror, now fromall four tables.Minerva drew another breath. “Last night we also lost what mayhave been the greatest Defense Professor in the history of Hogwarts.His scholastic merits alone… Our Defense Professor has gone by manynames, but his true name was David Monroe. As he was the last of theNoble and Most Ancient House of Monroe, his funeral—his second funeral, and the true one—will be held before the Most Ancient Hall of theWizengamot, in two days. Yet a wake shall also be held for the DefenseProfessor of Hogwarts, for our own Professor Quirrell, in this castle.That man also died a Hogwarts teacher, as nobly as a Hogwarts teacherever did.”Harry listened in silence, shoving down the tears that again rose to hiseyes. It wasn’t even true, let alone unexpected; and yet hearing it still hurt.From where he sat beside, Anthony Goldstein put a comforting hand overHarry’s hand, and Harry left it there.“Fourth. One piece of exceedingly unexpected and happy news. Hermione Granger is alive and in full health, sound of body and mind. MissGranger is being observed at St. Mungo’s to see if there are any unexpected afteraffects from whatever happened to her, but she appears to bedoing astonishingly well considering her previous condition.”It should have produced wild cheers from Ravenclaw and Gryffindor,if the news had come as part of any other package, or if it had been moreunexpected. As it stood, Harry saw a few smiles, but they were brief.Maybe they’d jumped for joy earlier, but at the moment there was onlysilence. Harry understood that. He wasn’t cheering either, not right now.“Finally—” Minerva McGonagall faltered, then raised her voice. “Ifear that I have the gravest possible news to share with some of our students. It seems that You-Know-Who summoned those who were once hisfollowers; and many of them obeyed, whether from terribly misguidedloyalty, or out of fear for their families if they refused. A sacrifice was required, it seems, to complete You-Know-Who’s resurrection; or perhapsYou-Know-Who blamed his former followers for his defeat. Thirty-sevenbodies were found, more followers outside Azkaban than You-KnowWho was thought to have. I am afraid—” Minerva McGonagall falteredagain. “I am afraid that among the deceased are the parents of many ofour students—”no no no no no no NO NO NO NOAs though by some terrible magnet, Harry’s eyes were drawn to thepicture of absolute horror that was Draco Malfoy’s face, even as the comforting cotton wrap around Harry’s thoughts was torn away like thin tissue.How could he have not thought, how could he have not realised—Somewhere in the background, someone was already screaming, andyet the room seemed very silent.“Sheila, Flora, and Hestia Carrow. Lost both their parents last night.Students who have lost their fathers include Robert Jugson. Ethan Jugson. Sara Jugson. Michael MacNair. Riley and Randy Rookwood. Lily Lu.Sasha Sproch. Daniel Gibson. Jason Gross. Elsie Ambrose—”Maybe Lucius realised, maybe he was smart enough to stay away, maybe herealised that Voldemort was the one who struck at Draco—“—Theodore Nott. Vincent Crabbe. Gregory Goyle. Draco Malfoy.This concludes the list.”One student sitting at the Gryffindor table let out a single cheer, andwas immediately slapped by the Gryffindor witch sitting nearby hardenough that a Muggle would have lost teeth.“Thirty points from Gryffindor and detention for the first month ofnext year,” Professor McGonagall said, her voice hard enough to breakstone.“Lies!” shrieked a tall Slytherin, who’d risen up from that table. “Lies!Lies! The Dark Lord will return, and he’ll, he’ll teach you all the meaning of—”“Mr. Jugson,” said Severus Snape’s voice. It was also faltering, it didn’tsound like the Potions Master at all, it wasn’t loud and yet the Slytherinfell silent. “Robert. The Dark Lord killed your father.”Robert Jugson let out a scream of terrific fury and turned to run out ofthe room, and Draco Malfoy folded in on himself like a collapsing houseand made sounds that nobody heard, because the babble was starting upnow.Harry rose six inches from the bench and then stopped.what would you say to Draco there is nothing you can say to Dracoyou can’t go over there now and pretend to be his friendyou want to make it right you want to make it better but you cannotmake it right there is no way you can make right what you have done tohim what you did to Vincent to Gregory what you did to TheodoreThe world blurred around Harry, he barely saw Padma Patil rise upand make her way toward the Slytherin table and Draco, or Seamus heading towards Theodore.And because Harry had read his father’s science fiction and fantasycollection, because he had already read this scene a dozen times overwhen it happened to other protagonists, there was an image in Harry’smind of Mad-Eye Moody, of the scarred man called Alastor. And MadEye’s image was saying, in just the same voice he’d used to speak to AlbusDumbledore in memory, that the Death Eaters had been pointing theirwands at Harry, that they had already chosen to take the Dark Mark, thatthey had been guilty of sins beyond reckoning and maybe beyond Harry’simagination, that they had foregone the deontological protection of goodpeople and made themselves targetable if there was a strong reason tosacrifice them. That it had been necessary to save Harry’s innocent parents from torture and Azkaban, that it had been necessary to protect theworld from Voldemort. That plain old ordinary Aurors and judges hadto do much more morally questionable things than killing sworn andblooded Death Eaters who were pointing wands at them, in the course ofcarrying out ordinary justices that were less clear-cut but still necessaryto society. If it were not right to do what Harry had done, if it were notright to do much more morally ambiguous things than what Harry haddone, then society as human beings knew it could not exist. Nobody withcommon sense would blame Harry for doing it, Neville wouldn’t blamehim, Professor McGonagall wouldn’t blame him, Dumbledore wouldn’tblame him, even Hermione would tell him it had been the right thing todo once she knew.And all of this was true.Just as it was also true that some part of Harry’s mind had calculatedthat wiping out the blood purist political elite would make it easier andmore convenient to rebuild magical Britain afterward. It hadn’t beenan important consideration, but it had still been calculated in those instants of rapid thought, a check on the long-term consequences to seeif they rated as catastrophic, and a decision that they actually rated aspretty much okay. And that check had forgotten that Death Eaters hadchildren at Hogwarts or that one of them wore the face of Draco’s father.It wouldn’t have changed anything. It wouldn’t have changed anything atall. But that was the truth of the calculation Harry’s mind had performed,given only seconds to think.At least Harry could, if the Death Eaters’ survivors were in any sortof financial trouble, do something about that easily enough. Transfiguregold, and use the Stone to make it permanent—unless making thatmuch gold would be troublesome to the wizard economy at large, orcause objections from goblins who didn’t understand market monetaristeconomics—though it wasn’t as though Harry didn’t also have usefulservices to sell—Other cotton wrap was also being torn off Harry’s thoughts, now.“It seems likely,” Minerva said, her voice was not loud but it cutthrough all other sounds, “that some of our students will also have beenstripped last night of those named as their guardians. Should you endup a ward of Hogwarts, please know that I will take the responsibilitiesof my position with extreme seriousness. You will be extended everycourtesy. Your family’s vault will be managed well and truly. As best Ican, I will treat every one of you as I would my own children—and I willprotect you as much as I would protect my own children, no more, noless. I hope that is clear to EVERYONE AT HOGWARTS.”Students nodded rapidly.“Good,” Minerva said. Her voice sank back. “Then there is one morething that must be done.”With a sad, solemn air, Professor Sinistra emerged from a side entrance. She was wearing white robes instead of her usual brown, andinstead of her customary witch’s hat, she was wearing a many-tasseledsquare hat whose colors had faded into mostly gray.In her hands, Professor Sinistra carried the Sorting Hat.With the air of someone carrying out a ceremony that had notchanged in centuries, Aurora Sinistra kneeled, on one knee, beforeMinerva McGonagall, presenting to her the Sorting Hat in both hands.Minerva McGonagall took the Sorting Hat from Professor Sinistra’shands, and placed it on her own head.There was a long silence.“As Albus Dumbledore is not dead,” Minerva said, her voice so lowthat students strained to hear it, “but only taken from us, I accept this position in the capacity of Acting Headmistress only—until Dumbledore’sreturn.”A piercing cry split the Great Hall, and Fawkes was there, overflyingall Four Tables in a slow spiral arc. He passed over each of the tables, humming in his bird’s voice, a hum of absolute loyalty that would outlast thedeath of merely physical fires. Wait, the hum seemed to say. Wait until hisreturn, and be true.Fawkes circled Minerva McGonagall three times, feathered wingsbrushing around her as the tears began to creep down her cheeks; thenthe bird flew out a window above the Hall, and was gone.he Sun shone down on the Scottish green, striking sparks of reflectedwhite from every passing dewdrop or reflective leaf that happenedto position itself correctly, a clear blue sky for a funeral.Harry had declined to give the eulogy. He’d declined for the secondtime. Professor Flitwick had asked him about it weeks ago in May, to giveHarry time to write his lines before it would become necessary to speak;and Harry had said no then, too.So it fell to a sixth-year Gryffindor, Oliver Habryka, who had thefourth-highest total of Quirrell points among all the students, and whohad been General of an army. The seventeen-year-old boy was tall andnot especially handsome in solid black robes; instead of a red tie, he waswearing a purple tie such as Professor Quirrell had sometimes favored.Speaking, under the circumstances, ex tempore. The previous eulogies,written well in advance, had been discarded; Oliver Habryka had a parchment in his left hand, but he wasn’t looking at it at all.“Professor Quirrell was very sick,” the tall boy said, his wavering voicefalling into a hush of students, occasionally broken by a muffled sob. “Ithink if Professor Quirrell had been able to fight in the fullness of hispower, You-Know-Who couldn’t have beat him easily, and maybe not atall. They say that David Monroe was the only one that You-Know-Whowas ever afraid of, in his day. But,” Oliver’s voice broke, “Professor Quirrell wasn’t in the fullness of his power. He was very sick. He had troublewalking by himself. And he went to face the Dark Lord, alone.”There was a pause, then, while the students cried for a while.Oliver wiped away his tears with his sleeve, and spoke again. “Wedon’t know exactly what happened,” said Oliver. “I imagine the Dark Lordlaughed at him. Maybe made fun of the Professor, for challenging himwhen he couldn’t stand up. Well, he’s not laughing now, is he.”There were fierce nods from the students; all of them that Harry couldsee, from Gryffindor to Slytherin.“Maybe the Dark Lord knew some way of curing Professor Quirrell,You-Know-Who did come back from the dead after all. Maybe he offeredProfessor Quirrell his life if Professor Quirrell would serve him. ProfessorQuirrell smiled, and told the Dark Lord it was time for them to play agame called Who’s The Most Dangerous Wizard In The World.”If you don’t know, don’t just make stuff up. But Harry didn’t say anything.It was what Lord Voldemort might have tried, it was what Professor Quirrell might have said back.“And they aren’t telling us everything,” Oliver said, “but we can guesswhat happened next. We all know that Hermione Granger, who was oneof the Professor’s best students, was killed by a troll earlier this year, itmust have been the Dark Lord who made it happen, just like he framedher for the Blood-Cooling Charm. Professor Quirrell knew the Dark Lordwas behind it, so he stole Miss Granger’s body and preserved it, kept itsafe—”Couldn’t blame him for that one.“Then Professor Quirrell went out to face the Dark Lord. The DarkLord killed Professor Quirrell. And Hermione Granger came back to life.They say she’s alive and whole now, and maybe something more. Whenthe Dark Lord tried to seize her, all that was left of him afterward was hisburned robes and his hands around Miss Granger’s throat. Just as HarryPotter was protected from the Killing Curse by his mother’s love and sacrifice, Professor Quirrell willingly going out, to face, the Dark Lord alone,must have called, Hermione Granger’s spirit, back from, from wherever,she was—” Oliver’s voice was breaking.“Not just like that,” Harry said from the front row of seats, his ownvoice hoarse. He had to say something at this point, before it got out ofcontrol. If it wasn’t already out of control. “David Monroe was a powerful wizard, more powerful than anyone knew except him and me. I don’tthink you can bring someone back from the dead just by sacrificing yourself. No one should try doing it that way.”Such a beautiful story. It should have been true. It should have beentrue.“I don’t know very much about the person behind the Professor,”Oliver Habryka said, after he got himself under control again. “I knowDavid Monroe wasn’t a happy man. He never could cast a PatronusCharm.”Tears were gathering in Harry’s eyes again. It wasn’t right, it wasn’tfair, Voldemort had killed so many people, he should have died alongwith his followers, he didn’t deserve special treatment. But it hadn’t justbeen Harry’s weakness, it had been the horcruxes, Voldemort couldn’thave been killed outright. So Harry could admit it, he was glad, he wasglad Professor Quirrell wasn’t all gone…“But I, know,” said Oliver, tears glistening on his own cheeks, “Professor Quirrell, is happy, wherever, he is now.”On Harry’s left hand, a tiny emerald glowed bright beneath the morning sun.Not Heaven, not some faraway star, not a different place but a better person,I’ll show you, someday I’ll show you how to be happy—The tall boy glanced down at a parchment he held in his other hand,the first time he’d consulted it. “Professor Quirrell,” Oliver said, his voicenow fiercer and faster, “was, by far, the best Professor of Battle Magic thatHogwarts ever had. Salazar Slytherin couldn’t have been half as good ateacher, no matter what spells he knew. Professor Quirrell told us at thebeginning of this year that what he taught us would always be our firmfoundation in the arts of Defense. And it will be. Forever. We’ll teachit to the new students next year, no matter who we have for a professor.The older students will teach the younger ones. That’s the solution to thecurse on the Defense position. We won’t sit around waiting for authority1851 *to teach us. And we’ll make sure that Professor Quirrell’s teachings neverdie out of Hogwarts.”Harry looked at where Professor—no, Headmistress McGonagall—was sitting, and saw the Headmistress nodding silently, a look that wassad and stern and proud.“They haven’t let us see Miss Granger yet,” Oliver said. His voice quavered. “The Girl-Who-Revived. But I’ll always think of the Defense Professor when I see her. His sacrifice lives on in her, just as his teachingslive on in us.” Oliver glanced at where Harry sat, then looked down againat the parchment. “Here’s to Professor Quirrell, then, the best Slytherinthat ever was, what every Slytherin should be! Three cheers for him!”“Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah!”No one stayed silent this time, not a single student that Harry couldsee.now before the gargoyles that guarded the Headmaster’s—Harryno,stoodthe Headmistress’s office. He had been summoned by Professor Sinistra, told that it was an emergency, but the gates were notopening for him.Experiment had showed that the Stone made one Transfigurationpermanent every three minutes and fifty-four seconds, irrespective ofthe size of object Transfigured. Just once, holding the Philosopher’sStone up to the light of Harry’s most powerful flashlight in an otherwisedarkened closet, Harry had thought he’d seen an array of tiny pointsinside the chunk of crimson glass; but Harry hadn’t been able to seeit again, and now suspected himself of having imagined it. The Stonehad no other powers that Harry could detect, nor did it respond to anyattempted mental commands.Harry had given himself until noon tomorrow to figure out how to begin using the Stone without it being grabbed by someone else, trying notto think about what was still happening, what had always been happening, in the meanwhile.Ten minutes late, Minerva McGonagall approached, moving in a swiftstride. Her arms were full of papers, she was once again wearing the Sorting Hat.The gargoyles, with a brief sound of grinding stone, bowed low beforeher.“The new password is ‘Impermanence’,” Minerva said to the gargoyles, and they stepped aside. “I’m sorry, Mr. Potter, I was delayed—”“Understood.”Minerva mounted the long spiral stairs, climbing instead of waitingto be carried, Harry following behind her.“We are meeting with Amelia Bones, Director of the Department ofMagical Law Enforcement; with Alastor Moody, whom you have met;and with Bartemius Crouch, Director of the Department of International Magical Cooperation,” Minerva said as she climbed. “They areDumbledore’s heirs as much as you or I.”“How—how’s Hermione doing?” Harry hadn’t had a chance to askuntil now.“Filius said she seemed rather in shock, which I suppose is not surprising. She asked where you were, was told you were at a Quidditchgame, asked where you really were, and refused to speak with anyoneabout what happened until she was allowed to talk with you. She wastaken to St. Mungo’s, where,” the Headmistress now sounded slightlyperturbed, “a standard diagnostic Charm showed Miss Granger as ahealthy unicorn in excellent physical condition except that her maneneeds combing. Charms to detect active magic have each time detectedher as being in the process of transforming into another shape. Therewas an Unspeakable who showed up before Filius, ah, removed him.He performed certain spells he probably ought not to have known, anddeclared that Hermione’s soul was in healthy condition but at least amile away from her body. At that point the senior healers gave up. She’scurrently alone in a cell with the rats and flies—”“She’s what?”“I’m sorry, Mr. Potter, that’s Transfiguration jargon. Miss Granger isin an isolation chamber with a cage of tame rats, and a box of flies thatwill bear offspring in a single day. Logic suggests that whatever mysteryunderlies her resurrection, it left behind an emanation that is causing thehealers’ Charms to produce gibberish. But if nothing happens to the ratsor to the flies’ offspring, Miss Granger will be declared safe to return toHogwarts after she wakes up again tomorrow morning.”Harry still wasn’t sure… wasn’t sure at all, what Hermione would thinkof having been resurrected, at least under these particular circumstances.He didn’t actually think Hermione would yell at him for doing it wrong.That was just Harry’s brain trying to imagine her as a stereotype. Harryhad been legitimately exhausted and not thinking very straight when he’dcome up with that cover story, and Hermione would probably understandthat part. But he couldn’t imagine what Hermione would think…“I wonder how Miss Granger will feel about having also vanquishedYou-Know-Who,” Minerva said reflectively, climbing the moving stairsfast enough that Harry felt out of breath trying to keep up. “And peoplebelieving the most interesting things about her.”“You mean, because she’s always self-identified as a normal academicgenius, and now a bunch of people think of her as the Girl-Who-Revivedand everyone wants to shake her hand?” Harry said. Even though shedoesn’t remember doing anything to earn it. Even though it was all someone else’swork and other people’s sacrifices, and she’s getting the credit. Even though shedoesn’t feel like she’s actually done anything worthy of the way other people treather, and she’s not sure if she can ever live up to the person they imagine. “Gosh, Idon’t know, I can’t imagine what that feels like.”Maybe I shouldn’t have subjected her to it. But people had to be given something to believe or heaven knows what they’d have made up. Feeling guilty aboutthis would be stupid. I think.The two of them reached the top of the stairs, and came into the officefilled with dozens of strange objects, all facing a great desk and a mightythrone behind it.Minerva’s hand passed over one of those objects, the one with goldenwibblers, her eyes closing briefly. Then Minerva took off the Sorting Hatand put it on a hatrack that held three slippers for left feet. She transformed the mighty throne into a simple cushioned chair and the greatdesk into a round table, around which four other chairs rose up.Harry watched it all with a strange pang in his throat. He knew, without either of them saying anything, that there should have been more ceremony for the changing of the chairs, the changing of the table. Muchmore ceremony, for the first time the Headmistress sat down in her newoffice. But for whatever reason, there wasn’t time, and Minerva McGona* 1855 *gall was discarding all that for speed.A wave of Minerva’s wand lit the Floo-fire in the fireplace, even as Minerva sat down into the chair that had been Dumbledore’s.Harry quietly took one of the chairs around the table, sitting at Minerva’s left.Almost at once, the Floo-fire burned emeraldine and whirled out Alastor Moody, who spun around with his wand raised, taking in the wholeroom at a seeming glance, and then pointed his wand directly at Harryand said “Avada Kedavra.”It happened so fast, and took him so completely by surprise, thatHarry’s wand wasn’t even half-raised by the time Alastor Moody finishedthe incantation.“Just checking,” Alastor said to the Headmistress, whose own wandwas now pointed at Alastor, her mouth open as if to say words she couldn’tfind. “Voldie would’ve tried to dodge, if he’d taken over the boy’s body lastnight. I’ll still need to check the Granger girl, though.” Alastor Moodywent to Minerva’s right and sat down.Harry had thought, in that split second, to try producing a wordlesssilver Patronus glow from his wand; but his wand hadn’t been in place tointercept in time, not even close.Well, if I was feeling invincible before, that does for that. What a valuable lifelesson, Mr. Moody.Then the Floo-fire burned green again, and spat out the oldest,grimmest, toughest-looking witch Harry had ever seen, like beef jerkygiven human shape. The old witch did not have her wand in her hand,but she projected an air of authority that was stronger and stricter thanDumbledore’s.“This is Director Amelia Bones, Mr. Potter,” said Headmistress McGonagall, who’d regained her poise. “We are still waiting on DirectorCrouch—”“The corpse of Bartemius Crouch Jr. was identified among the deadDeath Eaters,” the old witch said without preamble, even as she continued toward the chairs. “It took us entirely by surprise, and I’m afraidBartemius is in considerable grief about it, on both counts. He will notbe with us today.”Harry kept the flinch inward.Amelia Bones sat down in a chair, sitting to Moody’s own right.“Headmistress McGonagall,” said the elder witch, still without hesitation or delay, “The Line of Merlin Unbroken, which Dumbledore leftto me in regency, is not responding to my hand. The Wizengamot musthave a Chief Warlock who is trustworthy, at once; matters are in great fluxin Britain. I must know what Dumbledore has done, immediately!”“Crap,” muttered Moody. His mad-eye was rolling wildly. “That’s notgood, not good at all.”“Yes, well,” said Minerva McGonagall, who looked rather apprehensive. “I cannot say that for certain. Albus—well, he clearly had an intimation that he might not survive this war. But I do not think he was expecting Miss Granger to come back from the dead and kill Voldemort onlyhours later. I do not think Albus was expecting that at all. I am not quitesure what his legacies will make of that—”Amelia Bones rose half out of her chair. “You mean to imply that theGranger girl may have inherited the Line of Merlin Unbroken? This is acatastrophe! She is twelve years old, untested—surely Albus would not beso irresponsible as to leave the Line to whoever happened to defeat Voldemort, without knowing who!”“Well, putting it simply,” Minerva said. Her fingers squared the paperwork she’d taken with her, now lying on the desk. “Albus did think heknew who would defeat Voldemort. There was a prophecy concerningit, a verified one, which now seems to be in abeyance, or—I don’t know,Madam Bones! I have one letter for Mr. Potter that I am to give him inthe event of Albus’s death or other departure, and then another letter thatAlbus said Mr. Potter would be able to open only after he defeated Voldemort. I am not sure what will happen to it now. Perhaps Miss Grangerwill be able to open it, or perhaps it can never be opened—”“Hold up,” Mad-Eye Moody said. He reached into his robes, drew outa long, grey-knobbed wand that Harry recognized; it was Dumbledore’swand, of a form and style not like any other wand in Hogwarts. Moodylaid the wand on the table. “Before we go any further, Albus left me aninstruction or two of his own. Pick up this wand, boy.”Harry hesitated, thinking.Albus Dumbledore sacrificed himself for me. He trusted Moody. This probablyisn’t a trap.Then Harry began to reach for the wand.It leaped up and flew across the table, into Harry’s hand. And the moment that Harry’s fingers grasped the handle it was like he heard a song,a paean of glory and battle that resonated in his mind. A wave of whitefire ran up the handle and over the wood, magnifying as it moved, bursting from the end in a tremendous spray of sparks. Through the woodbeneath his fingers ran a sense of strength and constrained danger, likea leashed wolf.Harry was also receiving an impression of distinct skepticism, as ifthe wand had some level of awareness, and it was wondering how thehell it had ended up being held by a Hogwarts first-year.“Right,” said Mad-Eye Moody into the puzzled stares. “So it wasn’tMiss Granger who defeated Voldie, then. Didn’t think so.”“What.” Amelia Bones spoke the word flatly.Mad-Eye Moody gave her a respectful nod. “Albus said this wand goesto whoever defeats its previous master. Took it off old Grindie, he did.Then Voldie defeated Albus, yesterday. Do I need to spell it out, Amelia?”Amelia Bones was staring at Harry, her mouth wide open.“That might not be right,” Harry said. He swallowed another pangof the awful guilt. “I mean, Voldemort used me as a hostage because I, Iwas stupid, and Dumbledore gave himself up to save me, maybe the wandthinks that counts as my defeating Dumbledore. Um, I did defeat Voldemort, though. Vanquished him. But I think it’s better if nobody has anyidea I was there.”Beep. Tick. Whirr. Ding. Poot.“That must have taken some doing,” Mad-Eye said. The scarred maninclined his head slowly, a gesture of profound respect. “Don’t feel tooguilty about losing Albus and David and Flamel, son, no matter howstupid you were. You won in the end. All of us put together never could.Just to check, son, you and David also destroyed Voldie’s horcrux? Andyou’re certain it was the real thing?”Harry hesitated, weighing up the probable consequences of trust, thepossible disasters of silence, and then shook his head to Moody in reply.He’d been planning to tell at least McGonagall about what was now insideher school, anyway. “Voldemort had… rather a lot of horcruxes, actually.So instead I Obliviated most of his memories, then Transfigured him intothis.” Harry raised his hand, and silently pointed to the emerald on hisring.Splat. Boing. Splat. Splat.“Huh,” Moody said, leaning back in his chair. “Minerva and I will beputting some alarms and enchantments on that ring of yours, son, if youdon’t mind. Just in case you forget to sustain that Transfiguration oneday. And don’t go hunting any other Dark wizards, ever, just live a quietand peaceful life.” The scarred man took a handkerchief and wiped at thebeads of sweat that had now appeared on his forehead. “But well done,lad, you and David both, may he rest in peace. This was his idea, I’mguessing? Well done, I say.”“Indeed,” said Amelia Bones, who had now regained her composure.“We all owe the both of you a tremendous debt of gratitude. But I sayagain that there is urgent business regarding the Line of Merlin Unbroken.”“I believe,” Minerva McGonagall said slowly, “that I had best give Albus’s letters to Mr. Potter, right now.” At the top of her stack of papersnow lay a parchment envelope, and a rolled-up parchment scroll sealedwith a grey ribbon.The Headmistress gave Harry the parchment envelope, first, andHarry opened it.If you are reading this, Harry Potter, then I have fallen to Voldemort, andthe quest now lies in your hands.Though it may shock you to learn, this was the end that I wished inmy heart would come to pass. For as I write this, it yet seems possible thatVoldemort may fall by my own hand. And then, in time, I shall myselfbecome the darkness you must overcome, to enter fully into your power.For it was said once that you might need to raise your hand against yourmentor, the one who made you, who you loved; it was said that you mightbe my downfall. If you are reading this, then that shall never come to pass,and I am glad of it.Even so, Harry, I would spare you this, the lonely fight against Voldemort. I write this, vowing to shelter you as long as I can, no matter thefinal cost to myself. But if I have failed, then know that I am glad of it, inmy own selfish way.With my passing, there is none left to oppose Voldemort as an equalsave you. His shadow will fall long and terrible over magical Britain, andmany will suffer and die for it. That shadow will not lift until you destroyits source, until you cleanse the heart of the darkness. How you are todo this, I do not know. If Voldemort knows not the power you bear, thenneither do I. You must find that power within yourself, you must learn towield it, you must become Voldemort’s final judge, and I beg you not tomake the error of showing him mercy.My wand, which I have left to you in Moody’s keeping, you must notdare to wield against Voldemort. For when that wand’s master is defeated,it passes to the victor in turn. When you have conquered my conqueror,then the wand will answer truly to your hand; but if you try to turn itagainst Voldemort before then, it will betray you for certain. Keep it outof Voldemort’s grasp at all costs. I should advise you not to wield thatwand at all, yet it is a device of great power, which you might need insome desperate case. But if you pick it up you must fear its treachery at alltimes.In my absence, the Wizengamot will inevitably fall to Malfoy. TheLine of Merlin Unbroken I have passed to you, with Amelia Bones as yourregent, until you come of age or come into your power. But she cannotoppose Malfoy for long, not with myself gone and Voldemort returned toadvise him. Soon, I think, the Ministry will fall, and Hogwarts will become the last fortress. To Minerva I have left Hogwarts’s keys, but youalone are its prince, and she will help you however she can.Alastor now leads the Order of the Phoenix. Heed his words well, bothhis advice and his confidences. It is one of my life’s greatest regrets that Idid not heed Alastor more and sooner.That you will in the end defeat Voldemort, I have no doubt.For that will be only the beginning of your life’s destiny. Of that, too,I am certain.When you have vanquished Voldemort, when you have saved thiscountry, then, I hope, you may embark upon the true meaning of yourdays.Hurry then to begin.Yours in death (or in whatever),Dumbledore.P.S. The passwords are ‘phoenix’s price’, ‘phoenix’s fate’, and‘phoenix’s egg’, spoken within my office. Minerva can move those roomsto where you can reach them more easily.Harry folded up the parchment and put its back into the envelope,frowning thoughtfully, then took the grey-ribboned scroll from theHeadmistress. When the long grey wand in Harry’s hand touched theribbon, it fell away at once; and Harry unrolled the scroll, and read it.Dear Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres:If you are reading this, you have defeated Voldemort.Congratulations on that.I hope you had some time in which to celebrate before you opened thisscroll, because the news in it is not cheerful.During the First Wizarding War, there came a time when I realisedthat Voldemort was winning, that he would soon hold all within his hand.In that extremity, I went into the Department of Mysteries and I invoked a password which had never been spoken in the history of the Lineof Merlin Unbroken, did a thing forbidden and yet not utterly forbidden.I listened to every prophecy that had ever been recorded.And so I learned that my troubles were far worse than Voldemort.1861 *From certain seers and diviners have come an increasing chorus offoretellings that this world is doomed to destruction.And you, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, are one of those foretoldto destroy it.By rights I should have ended your line of possibility, stopped youfrom ever being born, as I did my best to end all the other possibilities Idiscovered on that day of terrible awakening.Yet in your case, Harry, and in your case alone, the prophecies of yourapocalypse have loopholes, though those loopholes be ever so slight.Always ‘he will end the world’, not ‘he will end life’.Even when it was said that you would tear apart the very stars inheaven, it was not said that you would tear apart the people.And so, it being clear that this world is not meant to last, I have gambled literally everything upon you, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres.There were no prophecies of how the world might be saved, so I found theprophecies that offered loopholes in the destruction; and I brought aboutthe strange and complex conditions for those prophecies to come to pass. Iensured that Voldemort discovered a certain one of those prophecies, andso (even as I had feared) condemned your parents to death and made youwhat you are. I wrote a strange hint in your mother’s Potions textbook,having no idea why I must; and this proved to show Lily how to help hersister, and ensured you would gain Petunia Evans’s heartfelt love. I snuckinvisibly into your bedroom in Oxford and administered the potion thatis given to students with Time-Turners, to extend your day’s cycle by twohours. When you were six years old I smashed a rock that was on yourwindowsill, and to this day I cannot imagine why.All in the desperate hope that you can pass us through the eye of thestorm, somehow end this world and yet bring out its people alive.Now that you have passed the preliminary test of defeating Voldemort,I place my all in your hands, all the tools I can possibly give you. The Lineof Merlin Unbroken, the command of the Order of the Phoenix, all mywealth and all my treasures, the Elder Wand out of the Deathly Hallows,the loyalty of such of my friends as may heed me. I have left Hogwarts inMinerva’s care, for I do not think you will have time for it, but even thatis yours if you demand it from her.One thing I do not give you, and that is the prophecies. Upon the moment of my departure, they will be destroyed, and no future ones will berecorded, for it was said that you must not look upon them. If you thinkthis frustrating, believe me when I say that even your wit cannot comprehend what frustration you have been spared. I will die, or be lost byyou, or in some other way be taken from you—the prophecies are unclear,naturally—without ever once knowing what the future truly holds, or whyI must do what I do. It is all cryptic madness and you are well rid of it.There can only be one king upon the chessboard.There can only be one piece whose value is beyond price.That piece is not the world, it is the world’s peoples, wizard and Muggle alike, goblins and house-elves and all.While survives any remnant of our kind, that piece is yet in play,though the stars should die in heaven.And if that piece be lost, the game ends.Know the value of all your other pieces, and play to win.—AlbusHarry held the parchment scroll for a long time, staring at nothing.So.There were times when the phrase ‘That explains it’ didn’t really seemto cover it, but nonetheless, that explained it.Absently Harry rolled up the parchment scroll in his fist, still staringat nothing.“What does it say?” said Amelia Bones.“It’s a confession letter,” Harry said. “Turns out Dumbledore’s the onewho killed my pet rock.”“This is not a time for jokes!” cried the elder witch. “Are you the trueholder of the Line of Merlin Unbroken?”“Yes,” Harry said absently, his mind occupied with thoughts that were,by any objective quantification, overwhelmingly more important.The old witch was sitting very still in her chair. She turned her head,and locked eyes with Minerva McGonagall.Meanwhile Harry’s brain, which was juggling way too many possibilities over way too many time horizons, some of them involving literallybillions of years and stellar disassembly procedures, declared cognitivebankruptcy and started over. All right, what’s the first thing I have to do tosave the world… no, make it even more local, what do I have to do today… besidesfiguring out what to do, that is, and I’d better not delay before looking at whateverDumbledore left me in the Phoenix’s Egg room…Harry raised his eyes from the rolled-up parchment and looked atProfessor—at Headmistress McGonagall, at Mad-Eye Moody, and atthe leathery-looking old witch, as though seeing them for the first time.Though he was in fact seeing Amelia Bones for mostly the first time.Amelia Bones, head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement,whom Albus Dumbledore had thought worthy to lead the Wizengamot atleast temporarily. Her cooperation would be invaluable, maybe necessary,for… for whatever was headed Harry’s way. Dumbledore had chosen her,and he’d read prophecies Harry hadn’t seen.Amelia Bones, who had thought she’d been appointed regent over theLine of Merlin Unbroken and made the next Chief Warlock, only to findthat instead the position had gone to, apparently, an eleven-year-old boy.You will now, said the voice of Hufflepuff inside his head, you will nowbe polite. You will not be your usual brand of bloody idiot. Because the fate of theworld might just depend on it. Or not. We don’t even know.“I’m terribly sorry about all this,” Harry Potter said, then paused tosee what effect, if any, this polite statement had produced.“Minerva seems to think,” the old witch said, “that you will not takeoffense to honest words.”Harry nodded. His Ravenclaw part wanted to include the disclaimerabout that being different from people blatantly trying to push you downwhile crying that you were intolerant of criticism, but Hufflepuff vetoed.Whatever she had to say, Harry would hear.“I do not wish to speak ill of the departed,” the old witch said. “Butsince time immemorial, the Line of Merlin Unbroken has passed to thosewho have thoroughly demonstrated themselves to be, not only good peo* 1864 *ple, but wise enough to distinguish successors who are themselves bothgood and wise. A single break, anywhere along the chain, and the succession might go astray and never return! It was a mad act for Dumbledore to pass the Line to you at such a young age, even having made itconditional upon your defeat of You-Know-Who. A tarnish upon Dumbledore’s legacy, that is how it will be seen.” The old witch hesitated, hereyes still watching Harry. “I think it best that nobody outside this roomever learn of it.”“Um,” Harry said. “You… don’t think very much of Dumbledore, I takeit?”“I thought…” said the old witch. “Well. Albus Dumbledore was a betterwizard than I, a better person than I, in more ways than I can easily count.But the man had his faults.”“Because, um. I mean. Dumbledore knew everything you just said.About my being young and how the Line works. You’re acting like youthink Dumbledore was unaware of those facts, or just ignoring them,when he made his decision. It’s true that sometimes stupid people, likeme, make decisions that crazy. But not Dumbledore. He was not mad.”Harry swallowed, forcing a sudden moisture away from his eyes. “Ithink… I’m beginning to realize… Dumbledore was the only sane person,in all of this, all along. The only one who was doing the right things foranything like the right reasons…”Madam Bones was cursing under her breath, low dire imprecationsthat were making Minerva McGonagall twitch.“I’m sorry,” Harry said helplessly.Mad-Eye was grinning, the scarred face twisting up in a smile. “Always knew Albus was up to something he never told the rest of us. Lad,you have no idea how hard it is for me not to use my Eye on that scroll.”Harry quickly shoved the scroll into his mokeskin pouch.“Alastor,” Amelia said. The old witch’s voice was rising. “You are aman of sense, you cannot think the lad is able to fill Dumbledore’s socks!Not today!”“Dumbledore,” Harry said, the name tasting strange on his tongue,“did make one wrong assumption, when he made his decisions. Hethought we’d be fighting Voldemort for years, all of us together. Hedidn’t know I’d vanquish Voldemort immediately. It was the right thingfor me to do, it saved a lot of lives compared to fighting a long battle.But Dumbledore thought you would have years to learn me, trust me…and instead it was all over in an evening.” Harry inhaled. “Can’t you justpretend we’ve been fighting Voldemort for years and I earned your trustand everything? So that I’m not penalised for winning more quickly thanDumbledore expected?”“You are still a first-year in Hogwarts!” the old witch said. “You cannottake Dumbledore’s place, whatever his intentions!”“Right, that whole ‘looking like an eleven-year-old’ thing.” Harry’shand came up, rubbed at his nose where his glasses lay. I suppose I couldjust use the Stone, change myself to look like ninety…“I am not a fool,” the old witch said. “I know you are no ordinarychild. I have seen you speak to Lucius Malfoy, watched you frighten offa Dementor, and witnessed Fawkes grant your plea. Anyone with wisdom who saw you before the Wizengamot—by which I mean myself andat most two others—could guess that you had absorbed some portion ofYou-Know-Who’s shredded soul on the night of his undeath, but subduedit and turned his knowledge to good ends.”There was a slight pause in the room.“Well, yes, of course,” said Minerva McGonagall. She sighed, slumpeda bit in the Headmistress’s chair. “As Albus clearly knew from the very beginning, but thoughtfully declined to warn me about in any way whatsoever.”“Right,” Moody said. “I knew that. Yep. Perfectly obvious. Wasn’tconfused at all.”“I guess that’s close enough to the truth,” said Harry. “So, um. What’sthe problem, exactly?”“The problem,” Amelia Bones said, her voice perfectly even, “is thatyou are a bubbling, unstable blend of a Hogwarts first-year and YouKnow-Who.” She paused, as though waiting for something.“I’m getting better about that,” Harry said, since she seemed to bewaiting on his reply. “Quite rapidly, in fact. More importantly, it’s notsomething Dumbledore didn’t know.”The old witch continued. “Giving away your fortune and going in debtto Lucius Malfoy to keep your best friend out of Azkaban, as much as itdemonstrates your upstanding moral character, also demonstrates thatyou cannot corral the Wizengamot. I can see now that you did the rightthing for yourself, the thing you had to do to maintain your lease on sanityand hold back your inner darkness. But you also did a thing that Merlin’sheir must not do. A sentimental leader can be far worse than a selfish one.Albus, master and servant of a phoenix, was barely survivable—and evenhe opposed you that day.” Amelia gestured in the direction of Mad-EyeMoody. “Alastor has hardness. He has cunning. He still does not have thetalent for government. You, Harry Potter, do not yet have the sternness,the capacity for sacrifice, to direct even the Order of the Phoenix. Andbeing what you are, you must not try to become that person. Not now, notat your age. Align and fuse your divided soul in your own time, if youpossibly can. Do not try to be Chief Warlock while you are doing it. IfAlbus thought that was a good idea, he was crafting a nicer story at theexpense of real-world practicality. I do think the man had a problem withthat.”Harry’s eyes were a bit wide, listening to all this. “Um… what exactlydo you think is going on in here?” Harry tapped his head just above hisear.“I imagine that inside you is the soul of a boy who remains honest andtrue, gathering his will to force down the fragment of Voldemort’s spiritthat tries to consume him, even as it howls at him that he is sentimentaland weak—did you just giggle?”“Sorry. But seriously, it wasn’t ever that bad. More like having a lot ofbad habits I needed to break.”“Ahem,” said Headmistress McGonagall. “Mr. Potter, I think at thestart of this year it was that bad.”“Bad habits that chained into and triggered each other. Yes, those area bit more of a problem.” Harry sighed. “And you, Madam Bones… er.Sorry if I’m wrong about this. But my guess is that you’re feeling a bitupset that the Line went to an eleven-year-old?”“Not the way you are thinking,” the old witch said calmly. “Thoughit is natural for you to suspect me. The position of Chief Warlock is notone I will find pleasant, even compared to the horrors of Magical LawEnforcement. Albus persuaded me on the matter, and I would say thatI took some convincing, but the truth is that I did not waste his time inan argument I expected to lose. I knew I would hate the task, and I knewI would do it anyway. Minerva says you have some amount of commonsense, especially when others remind you of it. Can you really see yourselfstanding upon the Wizengamot’s high dais? Are you sure it is not someremnant of You-Know-Who that imagines himself suited to the position,or even desires it at all?”Harry took off his glasses and massaged his forehead. His scar stillached a bit, from the damage he’d done by picking at it yesterday until itbled in a suitably dramatic fashion. “I do have some common sense, andyes, being Chief Warlock sounds like a huge amount of aggravation and ajob that, in reality, does not fit me the tiniest bit. The trouble is. Um. I’mnot sure the Line of Merlin is just about being Chief Warlock. There’s, um.I suspect… that there’s weird other stuff that goes along with it. And thatDumbledore meant me to take responsibility for the… other stuff. Andthat the other stuff is… possibly quite amazingly important.”“Crap,” Moody said. Then Alastor Moody repeated, “Crap. Kid, shouldyou even be saying this to us?”“I don’t know,” Harry said. “If there’s a user manual, I haven’t lookedat it yet.”“Crap.”“And if these other matters require sternness and sacrifice?” AmeliaBones said, still camly. “If they test you as you were tested before theWizengamot? I am old, Harry Potter, and I am not without knowledge ofmysteries. You have seen how I was able to perceive your own nature atnearly a glance.”“Amelia,” Mad-Eye Moody said. “What would have happened if you’dhad to fight You-Know-Who last night?”The old witch shrugged. “I would have died, I expect.”“You’d have lost,” said Alastor Moody. “And the Boy-Who-Lived didn’tjust take out Voldie, he set it up so that his good friend Hermione Granger came back from the dead at the same time Voldie resurrected himself.There’s no way in hell or double hell that was an accident, and I don’t thinkit was David’s idea either. Amy, the truth is, none of us know what thekeeper of Merlin’s legacy has to do. But we’re not the right kind of crazyfor this crap.”Amelia Bones frowned. “Alastor, you know I’ve dealt with strangethings before. Dealt with them quite well, in my opinion.”“Yeah. You dealt with the crap so you could go back to real life. You’renot the kind of crazy that builds a castle out of the crap and lives there.”Moody sighed. “Amy, on some level you know exactly why Albus had toleave who-knows-what-job to the poor kid.”The old witch’s fists clenched on the table. “Do you have any idea ofthe disaster it would be for Britain? Call me sane, but I cannot accept thatoutcome! I have worked too long toward this day to see it fall apart now,now of all times!”“Excuse me,” Headmistress McGonagall said, sounding quite preciseand Scottish. “Is there any reason why Mr. Potter cannot simply instructthe Line that Madam Bones is his regent for the position of Chief Warlock,but not anything having to do with the Department of Mysteries, until hecomes of age? If Albus could tell the Line to appoint a regent only untilVoldemort’s defeat, it is clearly capable of following complex orders.”Slowly, this unexpected hammer-blow of common sense was absorbed by everyone present.Harry opened his mouth to agree to appoint Amelia Bones his regentfor Wizengamot-related matters, and then hesitated again.“Um,” Harry said. “Um. Madam Bones, I would much prefer if youtook charge of handling the Wizengamot instead of me.”“In that we are agreed,” said the old witch. “Shall we let it be done?”“But—”There was a sort of frustrated dropping-back of the others. “What isthe problem, Mr. Potter?” said the Headmistress, in a voice that indicatedshe hoped it was nothing serious.“Um. I think there’s a couple of things I might have to do very soonthat could… prove politically controversial, and in exchange for handingover the Line’s political power to Madam Bones I’m going to want her…um, cooperation on some things.”Amelia Bones exchanged another long stare with Minerva McGonagall. Then she looked back at Harry Potter.“I am indignant at your request!” Amelia Bones said. “Your hesitancyhas told me that you are weak and unused to bargaining, and will probably fold if I push back.”Harry closed his eyes.Slightly dark-tinged Harry opened them.“All right,” Harry said, “let me rephrase. I don’t mean to interfere withyour work on a day-to-day or even month-to-month basis, but I can’t justtoss off the final responsibility that Dumbledore left me. I’m not goingto owl you bizarre parchments out of nowhere, there can be discussionsfirst, but at some point I may have to give you an order. If you refusethe order I might have to take back the Line’s Wizengamot functions andassume direct control. Can you handle that?”“And if I say no?” said the old witch.Slight, slight the dark tinge… “I don’t have an alternative to you lined up.I could start by asking Augusta Longbottom who she thought might besuitable and work from there. But it may be important that we keep toDumbledore’s plan as much as possible, since I don’t know exactly whyhe did the things he did, and he thought Amelia Bones should be ChiefWarlock for a time. I’m not going to pull Merlin’s name on you, but… no,strike that, I am going to pull Merlin’s name on you, this might or mightnot be insanely important.”The old witch thought for a time, her eyes going from person to person around the table. “I am not satisfied with this,” she said after a time.“But the Wizengamot must be called to order soon. It will do for now.”Slowly the old witch reached into her robes, and took out a short rodof stone, dark stone.She placed the rod on the table before Harry. “Take what is yours,” shesaid. “And then do please give it back.”Harry reached out his hand to take it.In the moment that Harry’s fingers first touched the dark stone——nothing happened.Well, perhaps Merlin hadn’t been given to melodrama. That couldexplain why his final legacy looked like a small, unassuming dark rod. Ifthat was all that was needed for its function, that would be all that wasthere.Harry took up the Line, frowning at it. “I’d like to appoint AmeliaBones as my regent for Wizengamot-related functions.” Then, thethought occurring to him that he needed to specify a stopping point todefine a regency, Harry added, “Until I say that I’ve taken it back.”Then Harry made a face. He’d been hoping for more from the Line,but it was just a key to places in the Department of Mysteries where interesting things were kept, or to seals where Merlin and his successorshad stashed things that shouldn’t be destroyed but ought to be kept fromgeneral circulation. Aside from that, the Line didn’t do much.The Line didn’t let you bypass the Interdict of Merlin either. No, noteven if the fate of the galaxy was at stake. Not even if the person seemedsane, had taken an Unbreakable Vow, and honestly believed the worldwas about to be destroyed otherwise.Merlin had dreamed of a long run, a world that would last for eonsand not just centuries. The world had no reason not to last forever, if thetruly dangerous powers were removed and kept gone. Conversely, a single loophole in the safeguards made the world’s destruction only a matterof time. Someday Merlin’s Line would pass to the wrong person. It couldreject the obviously unworthy, but eventually it would pass into handstoo subtly flawed for the Line to detect. This was inevitable, when dealing with human beings, and Harry needed to keep that in mind before hesealed something where future Line-holders could retrieve it—the disaster of its inevitable misuse someday needed to be outweighed by its benefits over the next few thousand years.Harry let out a sad small sigh, under his breath. Merlin, you idiot…Thinking that didn’t unlock any final safeguards.There wasn’t anything currently on fire in the Department of Mysteries, so Harry carefully placed the Line back on the table.“Thank you,” the old witch said. She picked up the rod of dark stone.“Do you know how I am to use it to call the Wizengamot to order, or—never mind, I shall just try striking the podium. That seems obviousenough. To the rest of the country, of course, I am the Chief Warlock sofar as anyone knows except us four.”Harry hesitated. Then he imagined the owls he would receive if anyone knew he was allowed to second-guess the Chief Warlock, and what1871 *that would do to Amelia’s negotiating power. “Fine.”Amelia tucked the rod back into her robes. “I will not say it was apleasure doing business with you, Boy-Who-Lived, but it could have beenmuch worse. Thank you kindly for that.”Harry was already feeling worried about the exact balance of powerhere, from the way Madam Bones was acting. The others had, quite logically, deduced that it had been mostly David Monroe who’d planned theway to defeating Voldemort, which meant they were still underestimating him. It might take a crisis of some type, with Harry figuring it outsuccessfully for once instead of screwing up, before Amelia Bones startedto respect his authority. Or believe in it at all, actually… “So,” Harry said.“Any weirdness for me that you would have brought to Dumbledore whilehe was around?”Amelia looked thoughtful. “Since you ask… I can think of three things,indeed. First, we don’t have the faintest notion what ritual was used tosacrifice the Death Eaters and resurrect You-Know-Who. It correspondsto no known legend, and the magic traces from the ritual have been eradicated. So far as my Aurors can tell, everyone’s heads fell off their necksdue to natural causes. Except for Walden MacNair, who was killed bymagical fire after firing a Killing Curse from his wand. A very mysteriousritual indeed.” She was giving Harry Potter a rather precise look.Harry considered this, choosing his words carefully. Voldemort hadsaid he’d put up wards, so Harry had been confident of not being observed by Time-Turned Aurors, but still… “I think this is a matter youdon’t need to investigate too hard, Madam Bones.”The old witch grinned slightly. “We can’t be seen to go easy on the investigation of so many Noble deaths, Harry Potter. When I heard retoldyour particular account of David’s last stand, I made certain to send investigators whom I considered reliable in the usual quality of their work. Auror Nobbs and Auror Colon, in fact, who are widely respected outside myDepartment. I found their report to be quite fascinating reading.” Ameliapaused. “There’s a possibility that Augustus Rookwood left a ghost—”“Exorcise it before anyone talks to it,” Harry said, conscious of thesudden hammering of his heart.“Yes, sir,” the old witch said dryly. “I shall disrupt the soul’s anchoringa little, and none shall be the wiser when it fails to materialize. The secondmatter is that there was a still-living human arm found among the DarkLord’s things—”“Bellatrix,” Harry said. His mind had leaped back, made the connection that ongoing trauma had blurred. “I think that’s Bellatrix Black’sarm.” Lesath Lestrange hadn’t been named as someone who’d lost a parent. “Oh,bloody hell. She’s still out there, isn’t she. Can you use her arm to trackher down somehow?”Amelia Bones had acquired a sour look. “I see. As I was saying, a stillliving human arm was found among the Dark Lord’s things, but it provedto be easily incinerated.”“What idiot—” Harry stopped himself. “No, not an idiot. Because immediately destroying Dark objects is Department policy. Because of pastexperiences with rings that really should’ve been dropped into volcanosimmediately. Right?”Moody and Amelia nodded in unison. “Good guess, son,” said Moody.It might seem literarily inevitable that Harry’s past stupidity was going to come back and haunt him in some horrible fashion later, but thatwas no reason not to try subverting the plot. “I expect you’ve thoughtof this already,” Harry said, “but the obvious next step is to put out yourequivalent of an international bulletin for a thin witch missing her leftarm. Oh, and add twenty-five thousand Galleons pledged from me—Headmistress, it’s fine, please trust me on this—to whatever reward isbeing offered.”“Well said.” The old witch leaned forward slightly. “The third and finalmatter… there was one truly puzzling element to last night’s events, andI am curious to see what you make of it, Harry Potter. Found among thecorpses was the head and the body of Sirius Black.”“What?” yelled Moody, starting half from his chair. “I thought he was inAzkaban!”“So he is,” said Madam Bones. “We checked that at once. The Azkaban guards reported that Sirius Black was still in his cell. Black’s headand body have been transported to the St. Mungo’s morgue, and showthe same cause of death as the other Death Eaters, that is to say, his headspontaneously fell off. I am also told that Sirius Black is, as of this morn* 1873 *ing, sitting in the corner of his cell rocking back and forth with his headbetween his hands. No other duplicate Death Eaters have been found.Yet.”There was a pause filled with ticking and whooping things, as peopleconsidered this.“Ah…” said Minerva. “That’s not possible even by You-Know-Who’sstandards of possibility. Is it?”“I would have thought so too when I was your age, dear,” said Amelia.“It is the sixth strangest thing I have ever seen.”“You see, son?” said Moody. “This sort of thing is why nobody, evenme, can ever be paranoid enough.” The scarred man tilted his head, looking thoughtful, as his bright blue eye kept ever-roving. “Twin brother,concealed from the rest of the world? Walpurga Black gave birth to twins,couldn’t bear to kill one, knew old Pollux would demand it… nah, ain’tbuyin’ it.”“Any ideas, Mr. Potter?” said Amelia Bones. “Or is this another matterinto which my Department should not inquire too closely?”Harry closed his eyes and thought.Sirus Black had hunted down Peter Pettigrew, instead of fleeing thecountry as common sense would have suggested.Black had been found in the middle of the street, surrounded by bodies, laughing.Nothing left of Pettigrew except one finger.Pettigrew had been a spy for the Light, not a double agent but somebody who snuck around and found things out.One of the conspiracy theories about Pettigrew had been that he wasan Animagus, since he’d been good at ferreting out secrets even in hisHogwarts years.Dementors sapped all the magic in their vicinity.Professor Quirrell had said something about a particular type ofmagic that rearranged flesh like a Muggle smith reshaping metal withhammer and tongs…Harry opened his eyes again.“Was Peter Pettigrew a secret Metamorphmagus?”Amelia Bones’s face changed. She made a single croaking noise andfell backward within her chair.“Yes, in fact…” Minerva said slowly. “Why?”“Sirius Black Confunded Peter Pettigrew,” Harry’s voice explained patiently, “to force him to change shape and pretend to be Black. By the timethe Confundus wore off, Peter was in Azkaban and couldn’t change back.The Aurors are used to people in Azkaban saying absolutely anything toget out, so they didn’t listen while Peter Pettigrew was screaming aboutit over and over again until his voice wore out.”Even Mad-Eye Moody’s face showed the horror, then.“In retrospect,” said Harry’s voice, which seemed to be operating entirely on automatic, “you should have been suspicious when you managedto get that one Death Eater hauled off to Azkaban without a trial.”“We thought Malfoy was distracted,” whispered the old witch. “Thathe was only trying to save himself. There were other Death Eaters wemanaged to get then, like Bellatrix—”Harry nodded, feeling like his neck and head were moving on puppet strings. “The Dark Lord’s most fanatic and devoted servant, a naturalnucleus of opposition for anyone who contested Lucius’s control of theDeath Eaters. You thought Lucius was distracted.”“Get him out of there,” said Minerva McGonagall. Her voice rose to ascream. “Get him out of there!”Amelia Bones shoved herself up from the chair, whirled on the Floo—“Stop.”Everyone looked at Harry with astonishment, none more than Minerva McGonagall.Something else seemed to have taken over Harry’s voice. “There’s fourthings we still need to discuss. An innocent man has been in Azkabanfor ten years, eight months, and fourteen days. He can stay there a fewminutes longer. That’s how urgent those four things are.”“You—” whispered Amelia Bones. “You should not try to be this person, at your age—”“First. I think I should look at the complete police records on everyother Death Eater that went to Azkaban while Lucius was distracted. Canyou compile that by tonight?”“Within the hour,” said Amelia Bones. She looked gray.Harry nodded. “Second. Azkaban is over. You’ll need to start preparations now to move the prisoners to Nurmengard or other secure nonDementor prisons, and to provide treatment for their Dementor exposure.”“I,” said Amelia. The old witch seemed bent, diminished. “I… do notthink, that even with this… scandal, that the remainder of the Wizengamot will bend… and the Dementors must be fed, not so much as wehave fed them, but they must be given some victims, or they will roamthe world, prey on innocents…”“It doesn’t matter what the Wizengamot says,” Harry said. “Because—”Harry’s voice choked. “Because—” Harry took a deep breath, steadiedhimself. He thought he could see the shape now of the immediate future,could see it stretching out before him like a golden pathway lit with sunlight. Was this also written, in the book of Time that I must not see? “Becauseif I’m right about what comes next, then sometime very soon, HermioneGranger, the Girl-Who-Revived, is going to go to Azkaban and destroyall the Dementors there.”“Impossible!” spat Mad-Eye Moody.“Merlin,” whispered Amelia Bones. “Oh, dear Merlin. That’s what happened to the Dementor that Dumbledore ‘lost’. That’s why they’re afraidof you—and now her as well?” Her voice trembled. “What is this, what isall this?”If Hermione believes that Death can be defeated—Whether or not she could’ve believed that before, she’ll believe it now.“An authorized portkey to Azkaban would be appreciated—” Harry’svoice broke again. Tears were streaming down his cheeks.She can’t die. I have her horcrux.But Hermione doesn’t need to know about that. Not for one more week.If she’s willing to risk her own life to end this—“Though I think, she might make, her own way there…”“Harry?” said Headmistress McGonagall.Harry was crying now, huge ragged breaths bursting from him. Buthe didn’t stop talking. Somewhere out there Peter Pettigrew was waitingwhile Harry cried.Somewhere out there, everyone was waiting while he cried.“Third. Somewhere just inside the wards of Hogwarts. In a highly defensible position. But where emergency cases can be portkeyed in fromjust outside the wards. There’s going to be a high-security h-h-hospital.With very powerful guards, that have taken Unbreakable Vows, I don’t, Idon’t care how much gold it takes to pay for the Vows, it genuinely doesnot matter any more. And, and Alastor Moody is going to design the security architecture, and go completely overboard on paranoia without beingconstrained by a budget or sanity or common sense, only it has to opensoon.” Couldn’t stop talking to cry.“Harry,” said the Headmistress, “both of them think you’ve gone mad,they don’t know you well enough to know better. You need to slow downand explain.”Instead Harry reached into his pouch and signed letters with his fingers, and lifted out, his fingers straining, a five-kilo chunk of gold largerthan his fist, from when he’d been experimenting this morning. It madea heavy thud as it landed on the table.Moody reached over and tapped it with his wand, and then his throatmade an incomprehensible sound.“That’s your starting budget, Alastor, if you need money right away.Nicholas Flamel didn’t make the Philosopher’s Stone, he stole it, Dumbledore didn’t know the secret history but Monroe did. Once you knowhow it works, the Stone can do one complete restoration to full healthand youth every two hundred and thirty-four seconds. Three hundredsixty people per day. One hundred and thirty-four thousand healings peryear. That should be enough to stop, all the wizards everywhere, and allthe goblins and house-elves and whoever, from dying. Of old age, or anything else.” Harry was wiping away tears, over and over. “Flamel hadmore blood on his hands than a hundred Voldemorts, for all the peoplehe could’ve saved and didn’t. The whole time, Moody, the Philosopher’sStone could’ve healed all your scars and given you back your leg, any timeFlamel felt like it. Dumbledore didn’t know. I’m sure he didn’t know.”Harry smiled shakily. “I can’t imagine you as a teenage witch, MadamBones, but I bet it looks good on you. That’ll give you more energy for trying to keep the Wizengamot from messing with me, because if they getthe idea that the Stone is something they can mess with in any way, tax,regulate, I don’t care, Hogwarts is going to secede from Britain and become its own country. Headmistress, Hogwarts is no longer dependenton the Ministry for gold, or for that matter food. You may reform the educational curriculum at will. I’m thinking we may want to add some moreadvanced courses soon, especially in Muggle studies.”“Slow down!” said Minerva McGonagall.“Fourth—” Harry said, and then stopped.Fourth. Begin preparations for an orderly take-down of the Statute of Secrecyand to provide magical healing on a mass scale to the Muggle world. Those whooppose this agenda in any way may be denied services by the Stone…Harry’s lips couldn’t move. Not wouldn’t, couldn’t.With six billion Muggles thinking creatively about how to use magic…Transfiguring antimatter was just one idea. It wasn’t even the mostdestructive idea. There were also black holes and negatively chargedstrangelets. And if black holes couldn’t be Transfigured because theydidn’t already exist as magic defined that to within some spatial radius,there was just Transfiguring lots and lots of nuclear weapons and BlackDeath plague that could reproduce before the Transfiguration wore offand Harry hadn’t even thought about the problem for five minutes but itdidn’t matter because he’d already thought of enough. Someone wouldthink of it, someone would talk, someone would try it. The probabilitywas as close to certainty as made no difference.What happened if you Transfigured a cubic millimeter of up quarks,just the up quarks without any down quarks to bind them? Harry didn’teven know, and up quarks were certainly a kind of substance that alreadyexisted. All it might take was one single Muggleborn who knew the namesof the six quarks deciding to try it. That could be the clock ticking downto the prophesied end of the world.Harry would have tried to deny the thought, rationalize it away.He couldn’t do that either.It wasn’t a thing-Harry-Potter-would-do.Like water flowing downhill, Harry Potter would take no chanceswhen it came to not destroying the world.“Fourth?” said Amelia Bones, who was looking like she’d been hit repeatedly in the face with a planet. “What comes fourth?”“Never mind,” said Harry. His voice did not break. He did not foldover sobbing. There were still lives he could save and those took precedence. “Never mind. Chief Warlock Bones, I’ve given the regency of theWizengamot into your hands. Please use that position to announce internationally that the Stone’s healing power will soon be made available toall, and that meanwhile, all dying patients are to be kept alive at any cost,no matter what magic is required to do it. That announcement is yourabsolute priority. When you have done that you may rescue Peter Pettigrew and tell your old Department to begin preparations for shuttingdown Azkaban. Then please have someone prepare a full list of imprisoned Death Eaters and what was said at their trials and whether Luciusseemed strangely uninterested in defending them. Thank you. That’sall.”Amelia Bones turned without another word, and dashed into the Floolike it was her own self that was on fire.“And someone,” Harry said, his voice breaking again now that it wasall set in motion, and crying wasn’t costing time, though the vast majorityof total lives at stake had turned out not to be savable just yet, “someonehas to, someone tell Remus Lupin.”he boy sat in an office near to where the once-Deputy Headmistresshad held court. His tears had run dry hours ago. Now there wasonly the waiting to see what would become of him, the orphan ward ofHogwarts, whose life and happiness lay in the hands of his family’s enemies. The boy had been called to this room, and he had come becausethere was nothing else to do and nowhere else to go. Vincent and Gregory had left his side, called back by their mothers for their fathers’ hurried funerals. Perhaps the boy should have gone with them, but he couldnot bring himself to do so. He would not have been able to act the partof a Malfoy. The feeling of emptiness that filled him up was so profoundthat it left no room even for pretended courtesy.Everyone was dead.His father was dead, and his godfather Mr. MacNair, and his fallbackgodfather Mr. Avery. Even Sirius Black, his mother’s cousin, had somehow managed to die, and the last remnant of House Black was no friendto any Malfoy.Everyone was dead.There came a knock upon the office’s door; and then, when the boymade no reply, the door opened, revealing—“Go away,” Draco Malfoy said to the Boy-Who-Lived. He couldn’tmuster any force in the words.“I will soon,” Harry Potter said, as he stepped into the room. “Butthere’s a decision to be made, and only you can make it.”Draco turned his head toward the wall, because just looking at HarryPotter took more energy than he had left in him.“You have to decide,” Harry said, “what happens to Draco Malfoy afterthis. I don’t mean that in any ominous way. No matter what, you’re stillgoing to grow up to be the rich heir of a Noble and Most Ancient House.The thing is,” Harry’s voice was wavering now, “the thing is, there’s a horrible truth you don’t know, and I keep thinking that if you knew, you’d tellme not to be your friend anymore. And I don’t want to stop being yourfriend. But to just—never tell you—and always maintain that lie so I cango on being your friend—I can’t do that. It’s also wrong. I don’t… don’twant this anymore, I don’t want to be manipulating you. I’ve hurt you toomuch already.”Then stop trying to be my friend, you’re no good at it anyway. The wordsrose up into Draco’s consciousness, and were rejected from his lips. Hefelt like he’d mostly lost Harry already, from the games Harry had playedwith their friendship, the lies and manipulations; and yet the thoughtof going back to Slytherin alone, maybe without Vincent and Gregoryif their mothers terminated the arrangement… Draco didn’t want to dothat, he didn’t want to go back to Slytherin and live out his life amongonly people who’d agreed to be Sorted into Slytherin House. Draco wasbarely sensible enough to remember how many of his real friends werealso friends with Harry, that Padma was a Ravenclaw and even Theodorewas a Chaotic Lieutenant. All that remained of Malfoy House was a tradition, now; and that tradition said it wasn’t clever to tell the war’s victorto go away and stop trying to be friends with you.“All right,” Draco said emptily. “Tell me.”“That’s what I’m going to do,” Harry said. “And then the Headmistresswill come in after I leave, and seal away your last half-hour of memory.But before then, knowing the whole truth, you’ll get to decide whetheryou still want to be involved with me.” Harry’s voice was shaking. “Um.According to the records I was reading through before I came here, thestory really began in 1926 with the birth of a half-blood wizard namedTom Morfin Riddle. His mother died in childbirth, and he grew up in aMuggle orphanage, until his Hogwarts letter was brought to him by Professor Dumbledore…”The Boy-Who-Lived continued speaking, words that slammed intowhat was left of Draco’s mind like falling houses.The Dark Lord had been a half-blood. He’d never believed in blood purity fora fraction of a second.Tom Riddle had come up with the idea of Lord Voldemort as a bad joke.The Death Eaters had been meant to lose to David Monroe, so Monroe couldtake over.After giving up on that, Tom Riddle had gone on playing Voldemort insteadof actually trying to win, because he’d liked bossing the Death Eaters around.Voldemort used me to try to frame Father for my attempted murder, then usedme again to go after the Philosopher’s Stone. Draco couldn’t remember thatpart, but he’d already been told that he’d been used as a pawn alongsideProfessor Sprout, and that no charges would be filed.And then the last horror.“You—” whispered Draco Malfoy. “You—”“I’m the one who killed your father and all the other Death Eaters lastnight. They’d been told to open fire on me the moment I did anything,so I had to kill them in order to have a chance at dealing with Voldemort,who was a danger to the entire world.” Harry Potter’s voice was strained.“I didn’t think about you and Theodore and Vincent and Gregory, but if Ihad, I’d have done it anyway. My mind managed not to realise until afterwards that Mr. White was Lucius, but if I’d realised, I still wouldn’t haverisked leaving him alive, in case he knew wandless magic. The thought occurred to me long before that it would be pretty convenient, in terms ofthe political landscape, for all the Death Eaters to suddenly die. I alwaysthought that the Death Eaters were horrible people, much more stronglythan I ever let on to you, since the first day we met. But if your fatherhadn’t been there, and I’d had a button that could kill him remotely, Iwouldn’t have pressed the button just for political reasons. The way I feelabout what I’ve done, and whether there’s remorse… well, there’s a part ofme that’s screaming in generic horror about having killed anyone. Andanother part that says that from a moral standpoint, the Death Eaterssigned away their lives on the day they signed up with Voldemort. Theypointed their wands at me first, blah blah and so on. But right now I justfeel sick about what I’ve done to you. Again. I feel like,” Harry Potter’svoice wobbled a bit, “everything I do only hurts you, for all my good intentions, that you’ve only ever lost things from being around me, so if you tellme to stay away entirely from Draco Malfoy after this, then I will. And ifyou want me to try to be your friend for real this time, without ever tryingto manipulate you again, without ever using you again or risking hurtingyou again, then I will, I swear I will.”The next Lord Malfoy was crying, openly in front of his enemy, decorum and composure abandoned, because he didn’t have anyone left forwhose sake he could keep it.A lie.A lie.Everything had been a lie, it was all lies piled on top of lies, lies lieslies—“You should die,” Draco forced out. “You should die for having killedFather.” The words only filled him with more emptiness, but they had tobe said.Harry Potter just shook his head. “And if that’s not an option?”“You should hurt.”Harry only shook his head again.The Boy-Who-Lived pressed the Lord Malfoy for his decision.The Lord Malfoy refused to give it. He couldn’t say it, couldn’t bringhimself to say it, either way. He didn’t want the war’s victor and theirmutual friends to abandon him, and he wasn’t going to give Harry theabsolution he wanted, either.So Draco Malfoy refused to answer, and then the time of that self’smemory ended.The boy sat in an office near to where the once-Deputy Headmistress hadheld court. His tears had run dry hours ago. Now there was only thewaiting to see what would become of him, the orphan ward of Hogwarts,whose life and happiness lay in the hands of his family’s enemies. The boyhad been called to this room, and he had come, because there was nothingelse to do, and nowhere else to go. Vincent and Gregory had left his side,called back by their mothers for their fathers’ hurried funerals. Perhapsthe boy should have gone with them, but he could not bring himself to doso. He would not have been able to act the part of a Malfoy. The feelingof emptiness that filled him up was so profound that it left no room evenfor lies.Everyone was dead.Everyone was dead, and it had all been futile from the beginning.There was a knock upon the office door, and then, after a polite pause,it opened to reveal Headmistress McGonagall, dressed much as she haddressed when she was a Professor. “Mr. Malfoy?” his family’s victoriousenemy said. “Please come with me.”Listlessly, Draco rose up, and followed her out of the office. SeeingHarry Potter waiting beside her gave him some pause, but then his mindsimply shut it out.“Here’s the last thing,” Harry Potter said. “I found it in a folded parchment whose outside said that it was the last weapon to be used againstHouse Malfoy, telling me not to read any further until the whole war hungin the balance. I didn’t want to tell it to you before because I thought itmight prejudice your decision unfairly. If you were a good person whonever killed or lied, but you had to do one or the other, which would beworse?”Draco ignored him and continued in Headmistress McGonagall’scompany, leaving Harry behind looking sadly after.They came to the Headmistress’s old office, where she lit her Floo-firewith a wave of her wand, said to the green flame “Gringotts travel office”and stepped through after a firm glance in his direction.For lack of any other option, Draco Malfoy followed.She lay in bed, feeling more listless than usual that morning, awokentoo early with the Sun just beginning to rise—though the direct sunlightwas blocked by the skyscrapers that shadowed her house. A faint tinge ofhangover gnawed at her temples, dried her mouth; she tried to be sparing with the drink (though she didn’t know why she bothered) but yesterday she’d felt… even more depressed than usual, like she’d lost something, somehow. Not for the first time, not for the hundredth time, shethought about moving—to Adelaide, to Perth, maybe to Perth Amboy ifthat was what it took. She always had the sense there was somewhereelse she ought to be; but while she could live a comfortable life on the payments the insurance company made to her, she couldn’t afford luxuries.She couldn’t pay to go gallivanting around the world looking for someplace that fit her unsatisfied sense of belonging. She’d watched the TVfor long enough, she’d rented enough travelogues, to know that nowherethe VCR showed her gave her any more sense of rightness than Sydney.She’d felt frozen, stopped in time, ever since the traffic accident thathad stolen her memories—not just of a dead family that meant nothingto her now, but memories like how a stove worked. She suspected, no,she knew, that whatever her heart was waiting for, whatever key neededto turn inside her to make her life begin moving again, it was one morething she’d lost to that runaway minivan. She thought about that almostevery morning, trying to guess what she was missing, missing, missingfrom her life and mind.Somebody rang her doorbell.She groaned, turning her head far enough to look at the LED alarmclock at the side of her bed. 6:31, it said, with the AM dot lit. Seriously?Well, that idiot could wait while she staggered out of bed at her own pace,then.Stagger out of bed she did, ignoring the doorbell as it rang again, asshe ducked into the bathroom and dressed herself.She clambered down the stairs, ignoring the ever-nagging sense thatsomeone else ought to be answering her door for her. “Who’s there?” shecalled to the closed door; the door had a peephole, but it was fogged over.“Are you Nancy Manson?” came a woman’s voice, speaking in a precise Scottish accent.“Yes,” she said cautiously.“Eunoe,” spoke the Scottish voice, and Nancy leapt back in shock as aflash of light came from the door and hit her and…Nancy swayed, putting a hand to her forehead. Flashes of light justgoing through doors and hitting people, that was… that was… that wasn’tparticularly surprising…“Would you please open the door?” said the Scottish woman’s voice.“The war is over and your memories should be returning shortly. There’ssomeone here who ought to see you.”My memories—Nancy’s head was already feeling clogged, like she was about to starthacking something out of her brain, but she managed to reach out andyank the door open.There in front of her was a woman dressed as a (perfectly normal) witch,from black robes to tall pointed hat——and standing beside her a boy, with short white-blonde hair andwearing (perfectly normal) dark robes trimmed in green, staring at herwith his jaw dropped and eyes wide and beginning to fill with tears.Green-trimmed robes and white-blonde hair…Something warm stirred in her memory. She felt her heart rising intoher throat as she realized that the thing that she’d been looking for thesepast ten years might be right in front of her this very instant. Somewheredeep inside her, ice was cracking around her heart, the piece of her thathad been stopped for so long preparing to move once more.The boy was staring at her, his mouth working soundlessly.A mysterious name came into her mind, rose to her lips.“Lucius?” she whispered.somber mood pervaded the Headmistress’s office. Minerva had returned after dropping off Draco and Narcissa/Nancy at St. Mungo’s,where the Lady Malfoy was being examined to see if a decade living as aMuggle had done any damage to her health; and Harry had come up tothe Headmistress’s office again and then… not been able to think of priorities. There was so much to do, so many things, that even HeadmistressMcGonagall didn’t seem to know where to start, and certainly not Harry.Right now Minerva was repeatedly writing words on parchment and thenerasing them with a handwave, and Harry had closed his eyes for clarity.Was there any next first thing that needed to happen…There came a knock upon the great oaken door that had been Dumbledore’s, and the Headmistress opened it with a word.The man who entered the Headmistress’s office appeared worn, hehad discarded his wheelchair but still walked with a limp. He wore blackrobes that were simple, yet clean and unstained. Over his left shoulderwas slung a knapsack, of sturdy gray leather set with silver filigree thatheld four green pearl-like stones. It looked like a thoroughly enchantedknapsack, one that could contain the contents of a Muggle house.One look at him, and Harry knew.Headmistress McGonagall sat frozen behind her new desk.Severus Snape inclined his head to her.“What is the meaning of this?” said the Headmistress, sounding…heart-sick, like she’d known, upon a glance, just like Harry had.“I resign my position as the Potions Master of Hogwarts,” the mansaid simply. “I will not stay to draw my last month’s salary. If there are students who have been particularly harmed by me, you may use the moneyfor their benefit.”He knows. The thought came to Harry, and he couldn’t have said inwords just what the Potions Master now knew; except that it was clearthat Severus knew it.“Severus…” Headmistress McGonagall began. Her voice sounded hollow. “Professor Severus Snape, you may not realize how difficult it is tofind Potions Masters who can safely teach Muggleborns, or Professorssharp enough to keep Slytherin House in any semblance of order…”Again the man inclined his head. “I think it need not be said to you,Headmistress, but I recommend in the strongest possible terms that thenext Head of Slytherin be nothing like me.”“Severus, you only did as Albus told you to do! You could stay on andact differently!”“Headmistress,” Harry said. His own voice seemed also hollow, andHarry wondered at it, for he hadn’t known Severus Snape that well. “Ifhe wants to go, I think you should let him go.”Dumbledore was using him. Maybe not exactly the way Professor Quirrellthought, maybe it was prophecy rather than sabotaging Slytherin, but Dumbledore was still using him. There were things that could have been said long ago toSeverus, to free him. It’s clear why Dumbledore didn’t risk that, but still, Severuswasn’t being used kindly. Even his blindness and grief were being used, the wayhe didn’t grasp the consequences of his actions as Potions Master…“It is well to find you here, Mr. Potter,” Severus said. “There is unfinished business between us.”Harry didn’t know what to say, so he just nodded.Severus seemed to be having some difficulty speaking, as he stoodbefore the two of them with the grey knapsack on his shoulder. Finallyhe seemed to find the words he’d come to speak. “Your mother. Lily. Shewas—”“I know,” Harry said, through the thickness of his throat. “You don’thave to say it.”“Lily was a fine upstanding witch, Mr. Potter. I would not have youthink otherwise from any words I said to you.”“Severus?” said Minerva McGonagall, looking as shocked as if she’dbeen bitten by her own shoes.The former Potions Master kept his eyes on Harry. “More than onebar lay between myself and Lily, most notably my ill-advised attempts tocurry favor with the purebloods of my house. If I made it sound like onemistake upon a muddy field ended it all, if I pretended that she had noreason but shallowness not to love me, I hope your books have also toldyou why fools may say such things.”“They did,” Harry said. He was looking at the fine gray knapsack onSeverus Snape’s left shoulder, unable to meet the Potions Master’s eyes.“They did.”“However,” the former Potions Master continued, “I’m afraid I havenothing more to say about your father than what I’ve already told you.”“Severus!”The former Potions Master seemed to have eyes only for Harry. “TheDark Mark upon my arm is not dead, nor is the prophecy fulfilled by thatstory you recounted before the crowd. How did you destroy all but a remnant of the Dark Lord?”Harry hesitated. “I Obliviated most of his memories and… sealed him,I guess is how wizards say it. Even if the seal breaks, he won’t come backas himself.”Severus frowned briefly and then shrugged. “I suppose that is acceptable.”“Professor Snape,” Harry said, because this too was now his responsibility, “the Order of the Phoenix owes you for services rendered. I’m in anexcellent position to repay it, both financially and magically. Just in caseyou want to start your next life in a position of wealth, or with better hair,or something.”“Strange words to say to such as me,” the former Potions Mastersaid in a soft drawl. “I went to the Dark Lord intending to sell him theprophecy in exchange for Lily’s love becoming mine, by whatever darkness was required to achieve it. That is hardly something to be forgivenlightly. And then, in the years after when I was a Potions Master… thatyou experienced yourself. Do you think my service to the Order of thePhoenix has repaid all my sins?”“People are always broken,” Harry said, though the words stuck in histhroat. “They always make mistakes. At least you tried to repay them.”“Perhaps,” said the former Potions Master. “My final duty was to failin guarding the Stone, to be struck down. This I have done, and I survivedit, which I never expected to do.” Severus was leaning against the doorthrough which he’d entered, taking his weight off his left leg. “I would nothave thought to ask for your forgiveness, but since you offer it so freely,I will accept with thanks. From this day on I wish to take less unkindlyways, and I think that is best done by starting over.”Tears glistened on Minerva McGonagall’s nose and cheeks, when shespoke her voice was without hope. “Surely you could start over insideHogwarts.”Severus shook his head. “Too many students would remember me asthe evil Potions Master. No, Minerva. I will go someplace new, and takea new name, and find someone new to love.”“Severus Snape,” Harry said, because it was his responsibility to sayit, “has all your will been done?”“Lily’s killer is vanquished,” the man said. “I am content.”The Headmistress lowered her head. “Be well, Severus,” she whispered.“I do have one last piece of advice,” Harry said. “If you want it.”“What is it?” said Severus Snape.“Ruminating about the past can contribute to depression. You havemy blanket permisson to just never think about your past, ever. Youshouldn’t think that it’s your responsibility to Lily to bear your guiltfor her, or anything like that. Just keep your mind on your future andwhatever new people you meet.”“I shall take your wisdom into consideration,” Severus said neutrally.“Also, try a different brand of hair shampoo.”A wry grin crossed Severus’s face, and Harry thought it might havebeen, for the first time, that man’s true smile. “Drop dead, Potter.”Harry laughed.Severus laughed.Minerva was sobbing.Without saying anything else, the free man took a pinch of Floo powder, and cast it into the office’s fireplace, and strode into the green flamewhispering something that nobody caught; and that was the last that anyone ever heard of Severus Snape.nd it was evening and it was morning, the last day. June 15th, 1992.The beginning light of morning, the pre-dawn before sunrise,was barely brightening the sky. To the east of Hogwarts, where the Sunwould rise, that faintest tinge of grey made barely visible the hilly horizonbeyond the Quidditch stands.The stone terrace-platform where Harry now sat would be highenough to see the dawn beyond the hills below; he’d asked for that, whenhe was describing his new office.Harry was currently sitting cross-legged on a cushion, chilly premorning breezes stirring over his exposed hands and face. He’d orderedthe house-elves to bring up the hand-glittered throne from his previousoffice as General Chaos… and then he’d told the elves to put it back,once it had occurred to Harry to start worrying about where his taste indecorations had come from and whether Voldemort had once possesseda similar throne. Which, itself, wasn’t a knockdown argument—it wasn’tlike sitting on a glittery throne to survey the lands below Hogwarts wasunethical in any way Harry’s moral philosophy could make out—butHarry had decided that he needed to take time and think it through.Meanwhile, simple cushions would do well enough.In the room below, connected to the rooftop by a simple wooden ladder, was Harry’s new office inside Hogwarts. A wide room, surroundedby full-wall windows on four sides for sunlight; currently bare of furnishings but for four chairs and a desk. Harry had told Headmistress McGonagall what he was looking for, and Headmistress McGonagall had puton the Sorting Hat and then told Harry the series of twists and turns thatwould take him where he wanted to be. High enough in Hogwarts thatthe castle shouldn’t have been that tall, high enough in Hogwarts that nobody looking from the outside would see a piece of castle correspondingto where Harry now sat. It seemed like an elementary precaution againstsnipers that there was no reason not to take.Though, on the flip side, Harry had no idea where he currently was inany real sense. If his office couldn’t be seen from the lands below, thenhow was Harry seeing the lands, how were photons making it from thelandscape to him? On the western side of the horizon, stars still glittered,clear in the pre-dawn air. Were those photons the actual photons that hadbeen emitted by huge plasma furnaces in the unimaginable distance? Ordid Harry now sit within some dreaming vision of the Hogwarts castle?Or was it all, without any further explanation, ‘just magic’? He needed toget electricity to work better around magic so he could experiment withshining lasers downward and upward.And yes, Harry had his own office on Hogwarts now. He didn’t haveany official title yet, but the Boy-Who-Lived was now a true fixture of theHogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the soon-to-be-home ofthe Philosopher’s Stone and the world’s only wizarding institution of genuinely higher education. It wasn’t fully secured, but Professor Vector hadput up some preliminary Charms and Runes to screen the office and itsrooftop against eavesdropping.Harry sat on his cushion, near the edge of his office’s roof, and gazeddown upon trees and lakes and flowering grass. Far below, carriages satmotionlessly, not yet harnessed to skeletal horses. Small boats litteredthe shore, prepared to ferry younger students across the lake when thetime came. The Hogwarts Express had arrived overnight, and now thetrain cars and the huge old-fashioned engine awaited on the other sideof the southern lake. All was ready to take the students home after theLeave-Taking Feast in the morning.Harry stared across the lake, at the great old-fashioned locomotive hewouldn’t be riding home this time. Again. There was a strange sadnessand worry to that thought, like Harry was already starting to miss outon the bonding experiences with the other students his age—if you couldsay that at all, when a significant part of Harry had been born in 1926.It had felt to Harry, last night in the Ravenclaw common room, like thegap between him and the other students had, yes, widened even further.Though that might only have been from the questions Padma Patil andAnthony Goldstein had excitedly asked each other about the Girl-WhoRevived, the rapid-fire speculations shooting through the air from Ravenclaw to Ravenclaw. Harry had known the answers, he’d known all the answers, and he hadn’t been able to say them.There was a part of Harry that was tempted to go on the HogwartsExpress and then come back to Hogwarts by Floo. But when Harry imagined finding five other students for his compartment, and then spendingthe next eight hours keeping secrets from Neville or Padma or Dean orTracey or Lavender… it didn’t seem like an attractive prospect. Harry feltlike he ought to do it for reasons of Socializing with the Other Children,but he did not want to do it. He could meet with everyone again at thestart of the next school year, when there would be other topics of whichhe could speak more freely.Harry stared south across the lake, at the huge old locomotive, andthought about the rest of his life.About the Future.The prophecy Dumbledore’s letter had mentioned about him tearingapart the stars in heaven… well, that sounded optimistic. That part had anobvious interpretation to anyone who’d grown up with the right sort ofupbringing. It described a future where humanity had won, more or less.It wasn’t what Harry usually thought about when he gazed at the stars,but from a truly adult perspective, the stars were enormous heaps of valuable raw materials that had unfortunately caught fire and needed to bescattered and put out. If you were tapping the huge hydrogen-heliumreservoirs for raw materials, that meant your species had successfullygrown up.Unless the prophecy had been referring to something else entirely.Dumbledore might have been misinterpreting some seer’s words… buthis message to Harry had been phrased as if there’d been a prophecyabout Harry personally tearing apart stars, in the foreseeable future.Which seemed potentially more worrisome, though by no means certainto be true, or a bad thing if it was true…Harry vented a sigh. He’d begun to understand, in the long hours before sleep had taken him last night, just what Dumbledore’s last messageimplied.Looking back on the events of the 1991-1992 Hogwarts school year wasnothing short of bone-freezingly terrifying, now that Harry understoodwhat he was seeing.It wasn’t just that Harry had kept the frequent company of his goodfriend Lord Voldemort. It wasn’t even mostly that.It was the vision of a narrow line of Time that Albus Dumbledore hadsteered through fate’s narrow keyhole, a hair-thin strand of possibilitythreaded through a needle’s eye.The prophecies had instructed Dumbledore to have Tom Riddle’s intelligence copied onto the brain of a wizarding infant who would thengrow up learning Muggle science. What did it say about the likely shapeof the Future, if that was the first or best strategy the seers could find thatdidn’t lead to catastrophe?Harry could look back now on the Unbreakable Vow that he’d made,and guess that if not for that Vow, disaster might have already been setin motion yesterday when Harry had wanted to tear down the International Statute of Secrecy. Which in turn strongly suggested that the manyprophecies Dumbledore had read and whose instructions he’d followed,had somehow ensured that Harry and Voldemort would collide in exactlythe right way to cause Voldemort to force Harry to make that UnbreakableVow. That the Unbreakable Vow had been part of Time’s narrow keyhole,one of the improbable preconditions for allowing the Earth’s peoples tosurvive.A Vow whose sole purpose was to protect everyone from Harry’s current stupidity.It was like watching a videotape of an almost-traffic-accident that hadhappened to you, where you remembered another car missing you by centimeters, and the video showing that somebody had also thrown a pebblein exactly the right way to cause an enormous lorry to miss that nearcollision, and if they hadn’t thrown that pebble then you and all your family in the automobile and your entire planet would have been hit by thelorry, which, in the metaphor, represented your own sheer obliviousness.Harry had been warned, he’d known on some level or the Vow wouldn’thave stopped him, and yet he’d still almost made the wrong choice anddestroyed the world. Harry could look back now and see that, yes, thealternate-Harry with no Vow would’ve had trouble accepting the reasoning that said you couldn’t get magical healing to Muggles as fast as possible. If the alternate-Harry had acknowledged the danger at all, he wouldhave rationalized it, tried to figure out some clever way around the problem and refused to accept taking a few years longer to do it, and so the worldwould have ended. Even after all the warnings Harry had received, it stillwouldn’t have worked without the Unbreakable Vow.One tiny strand of Time, being threaded through a needle’s eye.Harry didn’t know how to handle this revelation. It wasn’t a sort ofsituation that human beings had evolved emotions to handle. All Harrycould do was stare at how close he had come to disaster, might come againto disaster if that Vow was fated to trigger more than once, and think…Think…‘I don’t want that to happen again’ didn’t seem like the right thought.He’d never wanted to destroy the world in the first place. Harry hadn’tlacked for protective feelings about Earth’s sapient population, those protective feelings had been the problem in a way. What Harry had lacked wassome element of clear vision, of being willing to consciously acknowledgewhat he’d already known deep down.And the whole thing with Harry having spent the last year cozyingup to the Defense Professor didn’t speak highly of his intellect either. Itseemed to point to the same problem, even. There were things Harry hadknown or strongly suspected on some level, but never promoted to conscious attention. And so he had failed and nearly died.I need to raise the level of my game.That was the thought Harry was looking for. He had to do better thanthis, become a less stupid person than this.I need to raise the level of my game, or fail.Dumbledore had destroyed the recordings in the Hall of Prophecy andarranged for no further recordings to be made. There’d apparently beena prophecy that said Harry mustn’t look upon those prophecies. And theobvious next thought, which might or might not be true, was that savingthe world was beyond the reach of prophetic instruction. That winning wouldtake plans that were too complex for seers’ messages, or that Divinationcouldn’t see somehow. If there’d been some way for Dumbledore to savethe world himself, then prophecy would probably have told Dumbledorehow to do that. Instead the prophecies had told Dumbledore how to create the preconditions for a particular sort of person existing; a person,maybe, who could unravel a challenge more difficult than prophecy couldsolve directly. That was why Harry had been placed on his own, to thinkwithout prophetic guidance. If all Harry did was follow mysterious orders from prophecies, then he wouldn’t mature into a person who couldperform that unknown task.And right now, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres was still a walkingcatastrophe who’d needed to be constrained by an Unbreakable Vow toprevent him from immediately setting the Earth on an inevitable coursetoward destruction when he’d already been warned against it. That had happened literally yesterday, just one day after he’d helped Voldemort almosttake over the planet.A certain line from Tolkien kept running through Harry’s mind, thepart where Frodo upon Mount Doom put on the ring, and Sauron suddenly realized what a complete idiot he’d been. ‘And the magnitude of hisown folly was at last laid bare’, or however that had gone.There was a huge gap between who Harry needed to become, and whohe was right now.And Harry didn’t think that time, life experience, and puberty wouldtake care of that automatically, though they might help. Though if Harrycould grow into an adult that was to this self what a normal adult was toa normal eleven-year-old, maybe that would be enough to steer throughTime’s narrow keyhole…He had to grow up, somehow, and there was no traditional path laidout before him for accomplishing that.The thought came then to Harry of another work of fiction, more ob* 1900 *scure than Tolkien:You can only arrive at mastery by practicing the techniques you have learned,facing challenges and apprehending them, using to the fullest the tools you havebeen taught, until they shatter in your hands and you are left in the midst of wreckage absolute… I cannot create masters. I have never known how to create masters.Go, then, and fail… You have been shaped into something that may emerge fromthe wreckage, determined to remake your Art. I cannot create masters, but if youhad not been taught, your chances would be less. The higher road begins after theArt seems to fail you; though the reality will be that it was you who failed your Art.It wasn’t that Harry had gone down the wrong path, it wasn’t that theroad to sanity lay somewhere outside of science. But reading sciencepapers hadn’t been enough. All the cognitive psychology papers aboutknown bugs in the human brain and so on had helped, but they hadn’tbeen sufficient. He’d failed to reach what Harry was starting to realisewas a shockingly high standard of being so incredibly, unbelievably rational that you actually started to get things right, as opposed to havinga handy language in which to describe afterwards everything you’d justdone wrong. Harry could look back now and apply ideas like ‘motivatedcognition’ to see where he’d gone astray over the last year. That countedfor something, when it came to being saner in the future. That was betterthan having no idea what he’d done wrong. But that wasn’t yet being theperson who could pass through Time’s narrow keyhole, the adult formwhose possibility Dumbledore had been instructed by seers to create.I need to think faster, grow up faster… How alone am I, how alone will I be?Am I making the same mistake I made during Professor Quirrell’s first battle,when I didn’t realise Hermione had captains? The mistake I made when I didn’ttell Dumbledore about the sense of doom, once I realised Dumbledore probablywasn’t mad or evil?It would help if Muggles had classes for this sort of thing, but theydidn’t. Maybe Harry could recruit Daniel Kahneman, fake his death, rejuvenate him with the Stone, and put him in charge of inventing bettertraining methods…Harry took the Elder Wand out of his robes, gazed again at the darkgrey wood that Dumbledore had passed down to him. Harry had tried tothink faster this time, he’d tried to complete the pattern implied by theCloak of Invisibility and the Resurrection Stone. The Cloak of Invisibilityhad possessed the legendary power of hiding the wearer, and the hiddenpower of allowing the wearer to hide from Death itself in the form of Dementors. The Resurrection Stone had the legendary power of summoning an image of the dead, and then Voldemort had incorporated it intohis horcrux system to allow his spirit to move freely. The second DeathlyHallow was a potential component of a system of true immortality thatCadmus Peverell had never completed, maybe due to his having ethics.And then there was the third Deathly Hallow, the Elder Wand of Antioch Peverell, that legend said passed from wizard to stronger wizard, andmade its holder invincible against ordinary attacks; that was the knownand overt characteristic…The Elder Wand that had belonged to Dumbledore, who’d been tryingto prevent the Death of the world itself.The purpose of the Elder Wand always going to the victor might be tofind the strongest living wizard and empower them still further, in casethere was any threat to their entire species; it could secretly be a tool todefeat Death in its form as the destroyer of worlds.But if there was some higher power locked within the Elder Wand, ithad not presented itself to Harry based on that guess. Harry had raisedup the Elder Wand and spoken to it, named himself a descendant ofPeverell who accepted his family’s quest; he’d promised the Elder Wandthat he would do his best to save the world from Death, and take upDumbledore’s duty. And the Elder Wand had answered no more stronglyto his hand than before, refusing his attempt to jump ahead in the story.Maybe Harry needed to strike his first true blow against the Death ofworlds before the Elder Wand would acknowledge him; as the heir ofIgnotus Peverell had already defeated Death’s shadow, and the heir ofCadmus Peverell had already survived the Death of his body, when theirrespective Deathly Hallows had revealed their secrets.At least Harry had managed to guess that, contrary to legend, the Elder Wand didn’t contain a core of ‘Thestral hair’. Harry had seen Thestrals, and they were skeletal horses with smooth skin and no visible maneon their skull-like heads, nor tufts on their bony tails. But what core wastruly inside the Elder Wand, Harry hadn’t yet felt himself knowing; norhad he been able to find, anywhere on the Elder Wand, the circle-triangleline of the Deathly Hallows that should have been present.“I don’t suppose,” Harry murmured to the Elder Wand, “you could justtell me?”There came back no answer from the globe-knobbed wand; only asense of glory and contained power, watching him skeptically.Harry sighed, and put the most powerful wand in the world back intohis school robes. He’d get it eventually, and hopefully in time.Maybe faster, if there was someone to help him do the research.Harry was aware on some level—no, he needed to stop being awareof things on some level and start just being aware of them—Harry was explicitly and consciously aware that he was ruminating about the Futuremostly to distract himself from the imminent arrival of Hermione Granger. Who would receive a clear bill of health from St. Mungo’s, when shewoke up very early this morning, and who would then Floo with Professor Flitwick back to Hogwarts. Whereupon she’d tell Professor Flitwickthat she needed to speak with Harry Potter immediately. There’d been anote from Harry to himself about that, when Harry had woken up laterthis morning with the sun already risen in the Ravenclaw dorm. He’dread the note, and then Time-Turned back to before the dawn hour whenHermione Granger would arrive.She won’t actually be angry with me.…Seriously. Hermione isn’t that kind of person. Maybe she was at the start ofthe year but she’s too self-aware to fall for that one now.…What do you mean, ‘…’? If you have something to say, inner voice, just say it!We’re trying to be more aware of our own thought processes, remember?The sky had gone full blue-gray, dawn barely short of sunrise, by the timethat Harry heard the sound of footsteps coming from the ladder thatopened into his new office. Hastily Harry stood up and began to brushoff his robes; and then, realising what he was doing, stopped the nervousmotions. He’d just defeated Voldemort, damn it, he ought not to be thisnervous.The young witch’s head and chestnut curls appeared in the openingand peered around. Then she rose up higher, seemed almost to run upthe ladder steps, like she was walking along an ordinary sidewalk but vertically; Harry could have blinked and missed it, how her one shoe camedown on the top rung of the ladder and then she leaped lightly onto theroof an instant later.Hermione. Harry’s lips moved around the word, but made no sound.There’d been something Harry had meant to say, but it had gone rightout of his mind.Maybe a quarter of the minute passed, on the rooftop, before Hermione Granger spoke. She was wearing a blue-edged uniform now, and theblue-bronze-striped tie of her proper House.“Harry,” said Hermione Granger, a terribly familiar voice that almostbrought tears to Harry’s eyes, “before I ask you all the questions, I’d liketo start by saying thank you very much for, um, whatever it is you did. Imean it, really. Thank you.”“Hermione,” Harry said, and swallowed. The phrase may I have permission to hug you, which Harry had imagined using for his opening line,seemed impossible to say. “Welcome back. Hold on while I put up someprivacy spells.” Harry took the Elder Wand out of his robes, got a bookfrom his pouch that he opened to a bookmark, and then carefully pronounced “Homenum Revelio,” along with two other recently-acquired security Charms that Harry had found himself barely able to cast if he wieldedthe Elder Wand. It wasn’t much, but it was marginally better securitythan just relying on Professor Vector.“You have Dumbledore’s wand,” Hermione said. Her voice washushed, and sounded as loud as an avalanche in the still dawn air. “Andyou can use it to cast fourth-year spells?”Harry nodded, making a mental note to be more careful who else sawhim do that. “Is it okay if I hug you?”Hermione moved lightly over to him; her movements were peculiarlyswift, more graceful than they’d been before. Her motions seemed to ra* 1904 *diate an air of something pure and untouched, reminding Harry againof how peaceful Hermione had looked when she was sleeping on Voldemort’s altar—Realization hit Harry like a ton of bricks, or at least a kilogram ofbrick.And Harry hugged Hermione, feeling how very alive she seemed. Hefelt like crying, and suppressed it, because he didn’t know whether thatwas just her aura affecting him or not.Hermione’s arms around him were gentle, exceedingly light in theirpressure, as if she were being deliberately careful not to snap his body inhalf like a used toothpick.“So,” Hermione said, once Harry had let go of her. Her young facelooked very serious, as well as pure and innocent. “I didn’t tell the Aurorsyou were there, or that it was Professor Quirrell and not You-Know-Whowho killed all the Death Eaters. Professor Flitwick only let them give meone drop of Veritaserum, so I didn’t have to say. I just told them the trollwas the last thing I remembered.”“Ah,” Harry said. He had somehow found himself staring at Hermione’s nose instead of her eyes. “What do you think happened, exactly?”“Well,” Hermione Granger said consideringly, “I got eaten by a troll,which I’d frankly rather not do again, and then there was a really loudbang and my legs were back, and I was lying on a stone altar in the middleof a graveyard in a dark moonlit forest I’d never seen before, with somebody’s severed hands clutched around my throat. So you see, Mr. Potter,finding myself in a situation that weird and dark and scary, I wasn’t going to make the same mistake I did last time with Tracey. I knew rightaway that it was you.”Harry nodded. “Good call.”“I said your name, but you didn’t answer,” said Hermione. “I sat upand one of the bloody hands slid down over my shirt, leaving little bitsof flesh behind. I didn’t scream though, even when I looked around andsaw all the heads and bodies and realized what the smell was.” Hermione stopped, took another deep breath. “I saw the skull masks and realized that the dead people had been Death Eaters. I knew right away thatthe Defense Professor had been there with you and killed them all, butI didn’t notice Professor Quirrell’s body was also there. I didn’t realizeit was him even when I saw Professor Flitwick checking the body. Helooked… different, when he was dead.” Hermione’s voice became quieter.She looked humbled somehow, in a way Harry couldn’t often rememberseeing. “They said David Monroe sacrificed his life to bring me back, thesame way your mother sacrificed herself for you, so that the Dark Lordwould explode again when he tried to touch me. I’m pretty sure that’s notthe whole truth, but… I’ve thought a lot of nasty things about our DefenseProfessor that I never should’ve thought.”“Um,” Harry said.Hermione nodded solemnly, her hands clasped in front of her asthough in penitence. “I know you’re probably too nice to say the thingsto me that you have a right to say now, so I’ll say them for you, Harry.You were right about Professor Quirrell, and I was wrong. You told meso. David Monroe was a little bit Dark and a whole lot Slytherin, and itwas childish of me to think that was the same thing as being evil.”“Ah…” Harry said. This was very hard to say. “Actually, the rest of theworld doesn’t know this part, not even the Headmistress. But in pointof fact you were one hundred and twelve percent correct about him being evil, and I’ll remember for future reference that although ‘Dark’ and‘evil’ may not technically be the same thing, there’s a great big statisticalcorrelation.”“Oh,” said Hermione, and fell silent again.“You’re not saying that you told me so?” said Harry. His mental modelof Hermione was yelling: I TOLD YOU SO! DIDN’T I TELL YOU SO, MR.The actual Hermione just shook her head. “I know you cared abouthim a lot,” she said softly. “Since I was right after all… I knew you’d probably be hurting a lot after Professor Quirrell turned out to be evil, andthat it wouldn’t be a good time to say I told you so. I mean, that’s what Idecided when I was thinking that part through several months earlier.”Thank you, Miss Granger. Harry was glad she’d said that much, though,it just wouldn’t have felt like Hermione otherwise.“So, Mr. Potter,” said Hermione Granger, tapping her fingers onher robe at around thigh level. “After the medi-witch drew my blood,it stopped hurting right away, and when I brushed away the little bitof blood on my arm, I couldn’t find where the needle had poked me. Ibent some of the metal in my bedframe without trying hard, and thoughI haven’t had a chance to test it yet, I feel like I should be able to runreally fast. My fingernails are pearly-white and shiny even though Idon’t remember painting them. And my teeth look like that too, which,being the daughter of dentists, makes me nervous. So it’s not that I’mungrateful, but just what exactly did you do?”“Um,” Harry said. “And I’m expecting you’re also wondering whyyou’re radiating an aura of purity and innocence?”“I’m WHAT?”“That part wasn’t my idea. Honestly.” Harry’s voice went small.“Please don’t kill me.”Hermione Granger raised her hands in front of her face, staring somewhat cross-eyed at her fingers. “Harry, are you saying… I mean, my radiating innocence and being all fast and graceful and my teeth being pearlywhite… is it alicorn my fingernails are made of?”“Alicorn?”“It’s the term for unicorn horn, Mr. Potter.” Hermione Grangerseemed to be trying to nibble her fingernails, and not having much luck.“So, I guess if you bring a girl back from the dead she ends up as, whatdid Daphne call it, a Sparkling Unicorn Princess?”“That’s not exactly what happened,” Harry said, though it was frighteningly close.Hermione took her finger out of her mouth, frowning at it. “I can’tbite through it either. Mr. Potter, did you consider the problems now thatit’s literally impossible for me to trim my fingernails and toenails?”“The Weasley twins have a magical sword that should work,” Harryvolunteered.“I think,” Hermione Granger said firmly, “that I would like to knowthe whole story behind all this, Mr. Potter. Because knowing you andknowing Professor Quirrell, there was some sort of plan going on.”Harry took a deep breath. Then he exhaled. “Sorry, it’s… classified. Icould tell you if you studied Occlumency, but… do you want to?”“Do I want to study Occlumency?” Hermione said, looking slightlysurprised. “That’s at least a sixth-year thing, isn’t it?”“I learned it,” Harry said. “I started with an unusual boost, but I doubtthat really mattered in the long run. I mean, I’m sure you could learncalculus if you studied hard, regardless of what age Muggles usually learnit. The question is, um.” Harry was having to control his breathing. “Thequestion is, do you still want to do… that kind of stuff.”Hermione turned, and looked at where the sky was lightening in theeast. “You mean,” she said quietly, “do I still want to be a hero now thatit’s earned me a horrible death that one time.”Harry nodded, then said “Yes” because Hermione wasn’t turning toward him, though the word felt blocked in his throat.“I’ve been thinking about that,” Hermione said. “It was, in fact, anexceptionally gruesome and painful death.”“I, um. I did set some things up just in case you still wanted to be a hero.There were some short windows of opportunity where I didn’t have timeto consult you, I couldn’t let you see me because I expected you to be givenVeritaserum later. But if you don’t like it, I can undo most of what I didand you can just ignore the rest.”Hermione nodded distantly. “Like making everyone think that I…Harry, did I actually do anything to You-Know-Who?”“No, that was all me, though please don’t tell anyone that. Just so youknow, that time the Boy-Who-Lived supposedly defeated Voldemort, onthe night of Halloween in 1981, that was Dumbledore’s victory and he leteveryone think it was me. So now I’ve defeated a Dark Lord once, andgotten credit for it once. It all balances out eventually, I guess.”Hermione went on gazing to the east. “I’m not really comfortable withthis,” she said after a while. “People thinking I defeated the Dark LordVoldemort, when I haven’t done anything at all… oh, that’s the same thingyou went through, isn’t it?”“Yeah. Sorry about inflicting that on you. I was… well, I was trying tocreate a separate identity for you in people’s minds, I guess. There wasjust the one opportunity and everything was sort of rushed and… I real* 1908 *ized afterwards that maybe I shouldn’t have, but it was too late.” Harrycleared his throat. “Though, um. If you’re feeling like you want to dosomething that’s actually worthy of the way people think about the GirlWho-Revived, um. I might have an idea for what you can do. Very soon,if you want.”Hermione Granger was giving him a look.“But you don’t have to!” Harry said hastily. “You can just ignore thiswhole thing and be the best student in Ravenclaw! If that’s what you prefer.”“Are you trying to use reverse psychology on me, Mr. Potter?”“No! Honestly!” Harry took a deep breath. “I’m trying not to decideyour life for you. I thought I saw, yesterday, I thought I saw what mightcome next for you—but then I remembered how much of this year I’dspent being a total idiot. I thought of some things Dumbledore said tome. I realized it genuinely wasn’t my place to say. That you could do anything you wanted with your life, and that above all, the choice had to beyour own. Maybe you don’t want to be a hero after this, maybe you wantto become a great magical researcher because that’s who Hermione Granger really was all along, never mind what your fingernails are made out ofnow. Or you could go to the Salem Witches’ Institute in America insteadof Hogwarts. I won’t lie and say I’d like that, but it really is up to you.”Harry turned to the horizon and swept his hand wide, as though to indicate all the world that lay beyond Hogwarts. “You can go anywhere fromhere. You can do anything with your life. If you want to be a wealthy sixtyyear-old merman, I can make it happen. I’m serious.”Hermione nodded slowly. “I’m curious about how you’d do that exactly, but what I want isn’t to have things done for me.”Harry sighed. “I understand. Um…” Harry hesitated. “I think… if ithelps you to know… in my case, things were being arranged for me a lot.By Dumbledore, mostly, though Professor Quirrell too. Maybe the powerto earn your own way in life is itself something you have to earn.”“Why, that sounds very wise,” Hermione said. “Like having my parents pay for me to go to university, so I can someday get my own job. Professor Quirrell bringing me back to life as a Sparkling Unicorn Princessand you telling everyone that I offed the Dark Lord Voldemort is just likethat, really.”“I am sorry,” Harry said. “I know I should’ve done it differently, but…I didn’t have much time to plan and I was exhausted and not really thinking straight—”“I’m grateful, Harry,” Hermione said, her voice softer now. “You’re being too harsh on yourself, even. Please don’t take it so seriously when I’msnarky at you. I don’t want to be the sort of girl who comes back from thedead, and then starts complaining about which superpowers she got andthat her alicorn fingernails are the wrong shade of pearly white.” Hermione had turned, was again gazing off at the east. “But, Mr. Potter… if Ido decide that dying a horrible death isn’t enough to make me rethink mylife choices… not that I’m saying that just yet… then what happens next?”“I do my best to support you in your life choices,” Harry said firmly.“Whatever they are.”“You have a quest already lined up for me, I’m guessing. A nice safequest where there’s no chance of my getting hurt again.”Harry rubbed his eyes, feeling tired inside. It was like he could hearthe voice of Albus Dumbledore inside his head. Forgive me, Hermione Granger… “I’m sorry, Hermione. If you go down that path I’m going to have toDumbledore you, and not tell you some things. Manipulate you, if onlyfor a short while. I do believe there’s something you might be able to donow, something real, something worthy of the way people are thinkingabout the Girl-Who-Revived… that you might have a destiny, even… butin the end that’s just a guess, I know a lot less than Dumbledore did. Areyou willing to risk the life you just got back?”Hermione turned to look at him, her eyes widening in surprise. “Riskmy life?”Harry didn’t nod, because that would have been outright lying. “Areyou willing to do that?” Harry said instead. “The quest that I think mightbe your destiny—and no, I don’t know any specific prophecies, it’s just aguess—involves literal descent-into-Hell type stuff.”“I thought…” Hermione said. She sounded uncertain. “I thought forsure that after this, you and Professor McGonagall wouldn’t… you know…let me do anything the least bit dangerous ever again.”Harry said nothing, feeling guilty about the false relationship credithe was getting. It was in fact the case that Hermione was modeling himwith tremendous accuracy, and that if not for Hermione having a horcrux, the surface of the planet Venus would have dropped to fractionalKelvin temperatures before Harry tried this.“On a scale of zero to a hundred, how literal a descent into Hell are wetalking about here?” said Hermione. The girl now looked a bit worried.Harry mentally calibrated his scales, remembering Azkaban. “I’d saymaybe eighty-seven?”“This sounds like something I should do when I’m older, Harry.There’s a difference between being a hero and being a complete lunatic.”Harry shook his head. “I don’t think the risk would change much,”Harry said, leaving aside the question of how much risk that really was,“and it’s the sort of thing that’s better done sooner, if someone does it atall.”“And my parents don’t get a vote,” Hermione said. “Or do they?”Harry shrugged. “We both know how they’d vote, and you can takethat into account if you like. Um, I said for Dr. and Dr. Granger not tobe told yet that you’re alive. They’ll find out after you come back fromyour mission, if you choose to accept it. That seems a bit… kinder on yourparents’ nerves, they just get the one pleasant surprise, instead of havingto worry about, um, stuff.”“Why, that’s very thoughtful of you,” Hermione said. “It’s nice thatyou’re so concerned about their feelings. May I think about this for a fewminutes, please?”Harry gestured toward the cushion he’d set down opposite his own,and Hermione moved over with fluid grace, and sat down to look out overthe castle-edge, still radiating peacefulness all over the place. They’d really need to do something about that, maybe pay someone to invent anAnti-Purity Potion.“Do I have to decide without knowing what the mission is?” Hermione asked.“Oh hell no,” Harry said, thinking of a similar conversation before hisown trip to Azkaban. “This is the sort of thing you have to choose freelyif you do it at all. I mean that’s an actual mission requirement. If you say1911 *that you still want to be a hero, I’ll tell you afterwards about the mission—after you’ve had some time to eat and talk to people and recover a bit—and you’ll decide then if it’s something you want to do. And we’ll test inadvance whether returning from death has allowed you to cast the spellthat normal wizards think is impossible, before you go out.”Hermione nodded, and fell back into silence.The sky had lightened further by the time Hermione spoke again.“I’m afraid,” Hermione said, almost in a whisper. “Not of dying again,or not just that. I’m afraid I won’t be good enough. I had my chance todefeat a troll, and instead I just died—”“That was a troll empowered by Voldemort as a weapon, plus he sabotaged all your magic items, just so you know.”“I died. And you killed the troll, somehow, I think I remember thatpart, it didn’t even slow you down.” Hermione wasn’t crying, no tearsglistened on her cheeks, she simply gazed off at the lightening sky wherethe Sun would rise. “And then you brought me back from the dead as aSparkling Unicorn Princess. I know I couldn’t have done that. I’m afraidI’ll never be able to do that, no matter what people think about me.”“This situation is where your journey begins, I think—” Harry paused.“Excuse me, I shouldn’t be trying to influence your decision.”“No,” Hermione whispered, still gazing at the hills below her. Sheraised her voice. “No, Harry, I want to hear this.”“Okay. Um. I think this is where you start. Everything that’s happenedup until now… it places you in the same place I started out in September,when I’d thought of myself as just being a child prodigy before, and thenI found something new I needed to live up to. If you weren’t comparingyourself to me and my,” adult cognitive patterns copied off Tom Riddle, “darkside… then you’d be the brightest star of Ravenclaw, who organized herown company to fight school bullies and kept her sanity under assault byVoldemort, all while she was only twelve years old. I looked it up, yougot better grades than Dumbledore did in his first year.” Leaving asidethe Defense grade, because that was just Voldemort being Voldemort. “Now youhave some powers, and a reputation to live up to, and the world is aboutto hand you some difficult tasks. That’s where it all begins for you, thesame as it began for me. Don’t sell yourself short.” And then Harry shut1912 *his mouth hard, because he was talking Hermione into it and that wasn’tright. He’d at least managed to stop before the part where he asked, ifshe couldn’t be a hero with all that going for her, who exactly she thoughtwas going to do it.“You know,” Hermione said to the horizon, still not looking at Harry,“I had a conversation like this with Professor Quirrell, once, about beinga hero. He was taking the other side, of course. But apart from that, thisis feeling like when he argued with me, somehow.”Harry kept his lips pressed shut. Letting people make their own decisions was hard, because it meant they were allowed to make the wrongones, but it still had to be done.Hermione spoke carefully, the blue fringes of her Hogwarts uniformnow seeming brighter against her black robes as the sky all around thembecame illuminated; there were no more stars in the west. “ProfessorQuirrell told me, he said he’d been a hero once. But people weren’t helping him enough, so he gave up and went off to do something more interesting. I told Professor Quirrell that it hadn’t been right for him todo that—what I actually said was ‘that’s horrible’. Professor Quirrell saidthat, yes, maybe he was an awful person, but then what about all the otherpeople who’d never tried to be heroes at all? Were they even worse thanhim? And I didn’t know what to say back. I mean, it’s wrong to say thatonly Gryffindor-style heroes are good people—though I think from Professor Quirrell’s perspective it was more like only people with big ambitions had a right to breathe. And I didn’t believe that. But it also seemedwrong to stop being a hero, to walk away like he’d done. So I just stoodthere looking silly. But now I know what I should’ve told him back then.”Harry controlled his breathing.Hermione stood up from her cushion, and turned to face Harry. “I’mdone with trying to be a heroine,” said Hermione Granger with the eastern sky brightening around her. “I shouldn’t ever have gone along withthat entire line of thinking. There are just people who do what they can,whatever they can. And there are also people who don’t even try to dowhat they can, and yes, those people are doing something wrong. I’mnot ever going to try to be a hero again. I’m not going to think in heroicterms if I can help it. But I won’t do any less than I can—or not a lot less, I1913 *mean, I’m only human.” Harry had never understood what was supposedto be mysterious about the Mona Lisa, but if he could have taken a pictureof Hermione’s resigned/joyous smile just then, he had the sense that hecould have looked at it for hours without understanding, and that Dumbledore could have read through it at a glance. “I won’t learn my lesson.I will be that stupid. I’ll go on trying to do most of what I can, or at leastsome of what I can—oh, you know what I mean. Even if it means riskingmy life again, so long as it’s worth the risk and isn’t being, you know, actually stupid. That’s my answer.” Hermione took a deep breath, her faceresolute. “So, is there something I can do?”Harry’s throat was choked. He reached into his pouch, and signed CL-O-A-K since he couldn’t speak, and drew forth the fuliginous spill of theCloak of Invisibility, offering it to Hermione for the last time. Harry hadto force the words from his throat. “This is the True Cloak of Invisibility,”Harry said in almost a whisper, “the Deathly Hallow passed down fromIgnotus Peverell to his heirs, the Potters. And now to you—”“Harry!” Hermione said. Her hands flew up across her chest, asthough to protect herself from the attacking gift. “You don’t have to dothis!”“I do have to do this. I’ve left the part of the path that lets me be a hero,I can’t risk myself adventuring, ever. And you… can.” Harry reached upthe hand that wasn’t holding the Cloak, and wiped at his eyes. “This wasmade for you, I think. For the person you’re going to become.” A weaponto fight Death, in its form as the shadow of despair that falls on human mindsand drains away their hope for the future; you will fight that, I expect, in moreforms than just Dementors… “I do not loan you, my Cloak, but give you, untoHermione Jean Granger. Protect her well forevermore.”Slowly, Hermione reached out, and took hold of the Cloak, lookinglike she was trying not to cry herself. “Thank you,” she whispered. “Ithink… even though I’m done with the notion of heroing… I think thatyou always were, from the day I met you, my mysterious old wizard.”“And I think,” Harry said, his own throat half-closed, “even if you denythat way of thinking now, I think that you were always destined to become, from the very beginning of the story, the hero.” Who must Hermione Granger become, what adult form must she take when she grows up, to pass1914 *through Time’s narrow keyhole? I don’t know the answer to that either, any morethan I can imagine my own adult self. But her next few steps ahead seem clearerthan mine…Harry let the Cloak go, and it passed from his hands to hers.“It sings,” Hermione said. “It’s singing to me.” She reached up, andwiped at her own eyes. “I can’t believe you did that, Harry.”Harry’s other hand came out of his pouch, now bearing a long goldenchain, at the end of which dangled a closed golden shell. “And this is yourpersonal time machine.”There was a pause, during which the planet Earth rotated a bit furtherin its orbit.“What?” said Hermione.“A Time-Turner, they call it. Hogwarts has a stock they give out tosome students, I got one at the start of the year to treat my sleep disorder.It lets the user go backwards in time, in up to six one-hour increments,which I used to get six extra hours per day to study. And to vanish out ofPotions class and so on. Don’t worry, a Time-Turner can’t change historyor generate paradoxes that destroy the universe.”“You were keeping up with me in lessons by studying six extra hoursper day using a time machine.” Hermione Granger seemed to be havingtrouble with this concept for some unaccountable reason.Harry made his face look puzzled. “Is there something odd aboutthat?”Hermione reached out and took the golden necklace. “I guess not bywizard standards,” she said. For some reason her voice sounded rathersharp. She arranged the chain around her neck, placing the hourglassinside her shirt. “I do feel better now about keeping up with you, though,so thank you for that.”Harry cleared his throat. “Also, since Voldemort wiped out the Houseof Monroe and then, so far as everyone believes, you avenged them bykilling Voldemort, I got Amelia Bones to railroad a bill through what’s leftof the Wizengamot, saying that Granger is now a Noble House of Britain.”“Excuse me?” said Hermione.“That also makes you the only scion of a Noble House, which meansthat to get your legal majority you just need to pass your Ordinary Wiz*1915 *arding Levels, which I’ve set us up to do at the end of the summer so we’llhave some time to study first. If you’re okay with that, I mean.”Hermione Granger was making some sort of high-pitched noise thatwould, in a less organic device, have indicated an engine malfunction. “Ihave two months to study for my O.W.L.S?”“Hermione, it’s a test designed so that most fifteen-year-olds can pass.Ordinary fifteen year-olds. We can get a passing grade with a low thirdyear’s power level if we learn the right set of spells, and that’s all we needfor our majorities. Though you’ll need to come to terms with getting Acceptable scores instead of your usual Outstandings.”The high-pitched noises coming from Hermione Granger rose inpitch.“Here’s your wand back.” Harry took it from his pouch. “And yourmokeskin pouch, I made sure they put back everything that was therewhen you died.” That pouch Harry withdrew from a normal pocket of hisrobes, since he was reluctant to put a bag of holding inside a bag of holdingno matter what was supposed to be harmless so long as both devices hadbeen crafted observing all safety precautions.Hermione took her wand back, and then her pouch, the motionssomehow managing to look graceful even though her fingers were a bitshaky.“Let’s see, what else… the oath you swore before to House Potter onlysaid you had to serve until ‘the day you die’, so you’re now free and clear.And right after your death I got the Malfoys to publicly declare that youwere innocent of all charges in Draco’s attempted murder.”“Why, thank you again, Harry,” said Hermione Granger. “That wasvery nice of you, and them too, I guess.” She was repeatedly running herfingers through her chestnut curls, as though, by organizing her hair, shecould restore sanity to her life.“Last but not least, I had the goblins start the process of buildinga vault in Gringotts for House Granger,” Harry said. “I didn’t put anymoney into it, because that was something where I could wait and askyou first. But if you’re going to be a superhero who goes around rightingcertain kinds of wrongs, it will help a lot if people consider you to bepart of the upper social strata and, um, I think it may help if they know1916 *you can afford lawyers. I can put in as much gold into your vault as youwant, since after Voldemort killed Nicholas Flamel, I ended up holdingthe Philosopher’s Stone.”“I feel like I ought to be fainting,” Hermione said in a high-pitchedvoice, “only I can’t because of my superpowers and why do I have thoseagain?”“If it’s all right with you, your Occlumency lessons will start onWednesday with Mr. Bester, he can work with you once per day. Untilthen, I think it might be better for the true origin of your powers notto become known just because a Legilimens looks you in the eyes. Imean, obviously there’s a normal magical explanation, nothing supersupernatural, but people do tend to worship their own ignorance and,well, I think the Girl-Who-Revived will be more effective if you remainmysterious. Once you can keep out Mr. Bester and beat Veritaserum, I’lltell you the entire backstory, I promise, including all the secrets you cannever tell anyone else.”“That sounds lovely,” said Hermione Granger. “I’m quite looking forward to it.”“Though you’ll need to take an Unbreakable Vow to not do anythingthat might destroy the world before I can tell you the more dangerousparts of the story. I mean, I literally can’t tell you otherwise, because Itook an Unbreakable Vow myself. Is that okay?”“Sure,” said Hermione. “Why shouldn’t it be okay? I wouldn’t want todestroy the world anyhow.”“Do you need to sit down again?” Harry said, feeling alarmed by theway Hermione was swaying slightly, as though in rhythm with the wordsbeing spoken.Hermione Granger took several deep breaths. “No, I’m perfectlypeachy,” she said. “Is there anything else I should know about?”“That was it. I’m finished, at least for now.” Harry paused. “I do understand that you want to do things for yourself, not just have them donefor you. It’s just… you’re going to be a more serious kind of hero, and theonly sane choice is for me to give you all the advantages I can manage—”“I understand that quite well,” Hermione said. “Now that I’ve actuallylost a fight and died. I didn’t used to understand, but now I do.” A breeze1917 *ruffled Hermione’s chestnut hair and stirred her robes, making her lookeven more peaceful in the dawn air, as she raised one hand and carefullyclenched it into a fist. “If I’m going to do this, I’m going to do it right.We need to measure how hard I can punch, and how high I can jump,and figure out a safe way to test if my fingernails can kill Lethifolds like areal unicorn’s horn, and I should practice using my speed to dodge spellsI can’t let hit me and… and it sounds like you could maybe arrange forme to get Auror training, like from whoever taught Susan Bones.” Hermione was smiling again now, a strange light in her eyes that would’vepuzzled Dumbledore for hours and that Harry understood immediately,not without a twinge of apprehension. “Oh! And I want to start carryingMuggle weapons, maybe hidden so nobody knows I have them. I thoughtof incendiary grenades when I was fighting the troll, but I knew I couldn’tTransfigure them fast enough, even after I stopped caring about obeyingthe rules.”“I have the feeling,” Harry said, imitating Professor McGonagall’sScottish accent as best he could, “that I ought to be doing somethingabout this.”“Oh, it’s much, much, MUCH too late for that, Mr. Potter. Say, can youget me a bazooka? The rocket launcher, I mean, not the chewing gum? Ibet they won’t be expecting that from a young girl, especially if I’m radiating an aura of innocence and purity.”“All right,” Harry said calmly, “now you’re starting to scare me.”Hermione paused from where she was experimenting with balancingon the tip of her left shoe, her arm reaching in one direction and her rightleg stretched in the other, like a ballet dancer. “Am I? I was just thinkingthat I didn’t see what I could do that a Ministry squad of Hit Wizardscouldn’t. They have broomsticks for mobility and spells that hit harderthan I possibly could.” She gracefully lowered her leg back down. “I mean,now that I can try a few things without worrying about who’s watching,I’m starting to think that I really really really like having superpowers. ButI still don’t see how I could win a fight that Professor Flitwick couldn’t, notunless it involves me taking a Dark Wizard by surprise.”You can take risks other people shouldn’t, and try again with the knowledgeof what killed you. You can experiment with new spells, more than anyone elsecould try without dying for sure. But Harry couldn’t say any of that yet, soinstead he said, “I think it’s okay to think more about the future, not justwhat you can do this very minute.”Hermione jumped high in the air, clicked her heels together threetimes on the way down, and landed on her tiptoes, perfectly posed. “Butyou said there was something I could do right away. Or were you justtesting?”“That part is a special case,” Harry said, feeling the chill of the dawnair against his skin. He was increasingly not looking forward to tellingsuper-Hermione that her Ordeal would involve facing her literal worstnightmare, under conditions where all her newfound physical strengthwould be useless.Hermione nodded, then glanced to the east. At once she went to theside of the roof and sat down, her feet dangling over the rooftop ledge.Harry went to her side and sat down too, sitting crosslegged and furtherback of the roof-edge.In the distance, a brilliant tinge of red was rising above the hills to theeast of Hogwarts.Watching the tip of the sunrise made Harry feel better, somehow. Solong as the Sun was in the sky, things were still all right on some level, likehis having not yet destroyed the Sun.“So,” Hermione said. Her voice rose a bit. “Speaking of the future,Harry. I had time to think about a lot of things while I was waiting in St.Mungo’s, and… maybe it’s silly of me, but there’s a question I still wantto know the answer to. Do you remember the last thing we talked abouttogether? Before, I mean?”“What?” Harry said blankly.“Oh…” Hermione said. “It was two months ago for you… I guess youdon’t recall, then.”And Harry remembered.“Don’t panic!” Hermione said, as a sort of strangled half-gurgle camefrom Harry’s throat. “I promise no matter what you say, I won’t burstinto tears and run away and get eaten by a troll again! I know it’s beenless than two days for me, but I think that dying has made a lot of things Iused to fret about seem much less important compared to what I’ve beenthrough!”“Oh,” Harry said, his own voice now high-pitched. “That’s a good useof a major trauma, I guess?”“Only, see, I was still wondering about it, Harry, because for me ithasn’t been very long at all since our last conversation, and we didn’t finish talking which was admittedly all my own fault for losing control of myemotions and then being eaten by a troll which I am definitely not goingto do again. I’ve been thinking I ought to reassure you that’s not goingto happen every time you say the wrong thing to a girl.” Hermione wasfidgeting, leaning from one side to the other where she sat, slightly backand forth. “But, well, even most people who are in love don’t do literallyone hundredth of what you’ve done for me. So, Mr. Harry James PotterEvans-Verres, if it’s not love, I want to know exactly what I am to you. Younever said.”“That’s a good question,” Harry said, controlling the rising panic. “Doyou mind if I think about it?”Bit by bit, more of the searingly brilliant circle became visible beyondthe hills.“Hermione,” Harry said when the Sun was halfway above the horizon,“did you ever invent any hypotheses to explain my mysterious dark side?”“Just the obvious one,” Hermione said, kicking her legs slightly overthe rooftop’s edge. “I thought maybe when You-Know-Who died rightnext to you, he happened to give off the burst of magic that makes a ghost,and some of it imprinted on your brain instead of the floor. But that neverfelt right to me, like it was just a clever explanation that wasn’t actuallytrue, and it makes even less sense if You-Know-Who didn’t really die thatnight.”“Good enough,” Harry said. “Let’s imagine that scenario for now.”His inner rationalist was looking back and facepalming again at how he’dmanaged to not-think-about hypotheses like that one. It wasn’t true butit was reasonable and Harry had never thought of any causal model thatconcrete, just vaguely suspected a connection.Hermione nodded. “You probably know this already, but I justthought I’d say it to be sure: You’re not Voldemort, Harry.”“I know. And that’s what you mean to me.” Harry took a breath, finding it still painful to say aloud. “Voldemort… he wasn’t a happy person. Idon’t know if he was ever happy, a single day in his life.” He never could castthe Patronus Charm. “That’s one reason his cognitive patterns didn’t takeme over, my dark side didn’t feel like a good place to be, it didn’t get positively reinforced. Being friends with you means that my life doesn’t haveto go the way Voldemort’s did. And I was pretty lonely before Hogwarts,although I didn’t realise it then, so… yeah. I might’ve been slightly moredesperate to bring you back from the dead than the average boy my agewould’ve been. Though I also maintain that my decision was strictly normative moral reasoning, and if other people care less about their friends,that’s their problem, not mine.”“I see,” Hermione said softly. She hesitated. “Harry, don’t take thisthe wrong way, but I’m not one hundred percent comfortable with that.It’s a big responsibility that I didn’t choose, and I don’t think it’s healthyfor you to lay it on just one person.”Harry nodded. “I know. But there’s more to the point I’m trying tomake. There was a prophecy about my vanquishing Voldemort—”“A prophecy? There was a prophecy about you? Seriously, Harry?”“Yeah, I know. Anyway, part of it went, ‘And the Dark Lord shall markhim as his equal, but he shall have power the Dark Lord knows not.’ Whatwould you guess that meant?”“Hmmm,” Hermione said. Her fingers tapped thoughtfully on theroof’s stone. “Your mysterious dark side is You-Know-Who’s mark onyou that made you his equal. The power he knew not… was the scientificmethod, right?”Harry shook his head. “That’s what I thought too at first—that it wasgoing to be Muggle science, or the methods of rationality. But…” Harry exhaled. The Sun had now fully risen above the hills. This felt embarrassingto say, but he was going to say it anyway. “Professor Snape, who originallyheard the prophecy—yes, that’s also a thing that happened—ProfessorSnape said he didn’t think it could just be science, that the ‘power theDark Lord knows not’ needed to be something more alien to Voldemortthan just that. Even if I think of it in terms of rationality, well, it turnsout that the person Voldemort really was,” why, Professor Quirrell, why, the1921 *thought still stabbing sickness at Harry’s heart, “he’d have been able tolearn the methods of rationality too, if he read the same science papersI did. Except, maybe, for one last thing…” Harry drew a breath. “At theend of all of it, during my final showdown with Voldemort, he threatenedto put my parents, and my friends, into Azkaban. Unless I came up withinteresting secrets to tell him, one person saved per secret. But I knew Icouldn’t find enough secrets to save everyone. And in the moment thatI saw no way at all left to save everyone… that’s when I actually startedthinking. Maybe for the first time in my life, I started thinking. I thoughtfaster than Voldemort, even though he was older than me and smarter,because… because I had a reason to think. Voldemort had a drive to be immortal, he strongly preferred not to die, but that wasn’t a positive desire,it was fear, and Voldemort made mistakes because of that fear. I think thepower that Voldemort knew not… was that I had something to protect.”“Oh, Harry,” Hermione said gently. She hesitated. “Is that what I amto you, then? The thing that you protect?”“No, I mean, the whole reason I’m telling you this, is that Voldemortwasn’t threatening to put you in Azkaban. Even if he’d taken over thewhole world, you’d have been fine. He’d already made a binding promisenot to harm you, because of, um, because of reasons. So in my momentof ultimate crisis, when I reached deep down and found the power Voldemort knew not, I did it to protect everyone except you.”Hermione considered this, a slow smile spreading over her face.“Why, Harry,” she said. “That’s the least romantic thing I’ve ever heard.”“You’re welcome.”“No, really, it does help,” Hermione said. “I mean, it makes the wholething much less stalker-y.”“I know, right?”The two of them shared a companionable nod, both of them lookingmore relaxed now, and watched the sunrise together.“I’ve been thinking,” Harry said, his own voice going soft, “about thealternate Harry Potter, the person I might have been if Voldemort hadn’tattacked my parents.” If Tom Riddle hadn’t tried to copy himself onto me. “Thatother Harry Potter wouldn’t have been as smart, I guess. He probablywouldn’t have studied much Muggle science, even if his mother was aMuggleborn. But that other Harry Potter would’ve had… the capacity forwarmth, that he inherited from James Potter and Lily Evans, he would’vecared about other people and tried to save his friends, I know that wouldhave been true, because that’s something that Lord Voldemort never did,you see…” Harry’s eyes were watering. “So that part must be, the remnant.”The Sun was well above the horizon now, the golden light illuminating both of them, casting long shadows off the other side of the rooftopplatform.“I think you’re just fine the way you are,” Hermione said. “I mean, thatother Harry Potter might’ve been a nice boy, maybe, but it sounds like Iwould’ve had to do all his thinking for him.”“Going by heredity, alter-Harry would have been in Gryffindor like hisparents, and the two of you wouldn’t have become friends. Though JamesPotter and Lily Evans were the Head Boy and Head Girl of Hogwarts backin their day, so he wouldn’t have been that bad.”“I can just imagine it,” Hermione said. “Harry James Potter, Sortedinto Gryffindor, aspiring Quidditch player—”“No. Just no.”“Remembered by history as the sidekick of Hermione Jean Granger,who’d send out Mr. Potter to get into trouble for her, and then solve themystery from the library by reading books and using her incredible memory.”“You’re really enjoying this alternate universe, aren’t you.”“Maybe he’d be best mates with Ron Weasley, the smartest boy in Gryffindor, and they’d fight side by side in my army in Defense class, and afterwards help each other with their homework—”“Okay, enough, this is starting to creep me out.”“Sorry,” Hermione said, though she was still smiling to herself, appearing rapt in some private vision.“Apology accepted,” Harry said dryly.The Sun rose a little further in the sky.After a while, Hermione spoke. “Do you suppose we’ll fall in love witheach other later on?”“I don’t know any better than you do, Hermione. But why does it haveto be about that? Seriously, why does it always have to be about that?Maybe when we’re older we’ll fall in love, and maybe we won’t. Maybewe’ll stay in love, and maybe we won’t.” Harry turned his head slightly,the Sun was hot on his cheek and he wasn’t wearing sunscreen. “No matter how it goes, we shouldn’t try to force our lives into a pattern. I thinkwhen people try to force patterns onto this sort of thing, that’s when theyend up unhappy.”“No forced patterns?” Hermione said. Her eyes had taken on a mischievous look. “That sounds like a more complicated way of saying norules. Which I guess seems a lot more reasonable to me than it would’veat the start of this year. If I’m going to be a Sparkling Unicorn Princessand have my own time machine, I might as well give up on rules, I suppose.”“I’m not saying that rules are always bad, especially when they actually fit people, instead of them being blindly imitated like Quidditch. Butweren’t you the one who rejected the ‘hero’ pattern in favor of just doingthe things she could?”“I suppose so.” Hermione turned her head again to gaze down at thegrounds below Hogwarts, for the Sun was too bright to look at now—though, Harry thought, Hermione’s retinas would always heal now, it wassafe for her alone to look directly into the light. “You said, Harry, that youthought I was always destined to be the hero. I’ve been considering, andI suspect you’re completely wrong. If this had been meant to be, thingswould’ve been a lot easier all round. Just doing the things you can do—you have to make that happen, you have to choose it, over and over again.”“That might not conflict with your being a destined hero,” Harry said,thinking of compatibilist theories of free will, and prophecies that hemust not look upon in order to fulfill. “But we can talk about that later.”“You have to choose it,” Hermione repeated. She pushed herself up onher hands, then popped herself backwards and onto the rooftop, rising toher feet in a smooth motion. “Just like I’m choosing to do this.”“No kissing!” Harry said, scrambling to his feet and preparing tododge; though the realization came to him that the Girl-Who-Revivedwould be much, much faster.“I won’t try to kiss you again, Mr. Potter. Not until you ask me, if youever do. But there are all these warm feelings bubbling up inside me andI feel like I might burst if I don’t do something, though it does now occur tome that it’s unhealthy if girls don’t know any way of expressing gratitudeto boys besides kissing them.” Hermione took out her wand and offeredit crosswise, in the position she’d used to swear her oath of fealty to HousePotter before the Wizengamot.“Oh hell no,” Harry said. “Do you realise what it took to get you out ofthat oath last time—”“Don’t go jumping to conclusions, you. I wasn’t about to swear fealtyto your House again. You’ve got to start trusting me to be sensible ifyou’re going to be my mysterious young wizard. Now please hold out yourwand.”Slowly, Harry took out the Elder Wand and crossed it with Hermione’s ten-and-three-quarter-inches of vinewood, forcing down a lastworry about her choosing the wrong thing. “Can you at least not sayanything about ‘until death takes me’, because did I mention I have thePhilosopher’s Stone now? Or anything about ‘the end of the world andits magic’? I’m a lot more nervous around phrases like that than I usedto be.”Upon a roof floored in square stony tiles, the brilliant morning Sunblazes down upon two not-really-children-anymore, both in blue-fringedblack robes, facing each other across crossed wands. One has brown eyesbeneath chaotic chestnut curls, and radiates an aura of strength andbeauty that is not magic only; the other has green eyes under glasses,with messy black hair above a recently inflamed scar. Below, a stonetower nobody remembers seeing from ground level stretches downwards into the broad base of the castle Hogwarts. Far beneath them arevisible the green hills, and the lake. In the distance a huge red-and-blackline of railcars and an engine, appearing tiny from this height, a trainneither Muggle nor fully magical. The sky is nearly unclouded, but forfaint tinges of orange-white where wisps of moisture reflect the sunlight. A light breeze carries the crisp chill of dawn, and the dampness ofmorning; but the huge blazing golden globe is now risen high above thehorizon, and its incandescence casts warmth on everything it touches.“Well, maybe after this you’ll be less nervous,” the hero says to herenigmatic wizard. She knows she doesn’t know the whole story, but thefragment of truth that she does hold shines bright like sunlight withinher, casting warmth on her insides the way the Sun warms her face. “I dochoose this, now.”Upon my life and magic I swear friendship to Harry Potter,To help him and trust in him,To stand with him and, um, stand by him,And sometimes go where he can’t go,’Till the day that death takes me for real, if it ever does, I mean,And if the world or its magic ends, we’ll deal with that together.Included here are the disclaimers and epigraphs from the first thirty orso chapters.

The boy had come to him with a terribly intense lookon his childish face—Dumbledore hoped that whatever this matter was,it wasn’t too serious. Harry was far too young for his life trials to bestarting already. “What was it you wished to speak to me about, Harry?”Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres leaned forward in his chair, smiling grimly. “Headmaster, I got a sharp pain in my scar during the SortingFeast. Considering how and where I got this scar, it didn’t seem like thesort of thing I should just ignore. I thought at first it was because of Professor Snape, but I followed the Baconian experimental method which isto find the conditions for both the presence and the absence of the phenomenon, and I’ve determined that my scar hurts if and only if I’m facingthe back of Professor Quirrell’s head, whatever’s under his turban. Whileit could be something more innocuous, I think we should provisionally assume the worst, that it’s You-Know-Who—wait, don’t look so horrified,this is actually a priceless opportunity—”Omake Files IIThis was the original version of Chapter 9. It was replaced because—while many readers did enjoy it—many other readers had massive allergies to songs in fanfics, for reasons that should not much need belaboring. I didn’t want to drive readers away before they got to Ch. 10.Lee Jordan is the fellow prankster of Fred and George (in canon). “LeeJordan” had sounded like a Muggleborn name to me, implying that hewould be capable of instructing Fred and George on a tune that Harrywould know. This was not as obvious to some readers as it was to yourauthor.Draco went to Slytherin, and Harry breathed a small sigh of relief. It hadseemed like a sure thing, but you never did know what tiny event mightupset the course of your master plan.They were approaching the Ps now…And over at the Gryffindor table, there was a whispered conversation.“What if he doesn’t like it?”“He’s got no right to not like it—”“—not after the prank he played on—”“—Neville Longbottom, his name was—”“—he’s as fair a fair target now as fair can be.”“All right. Just make sure you don’t forget your parts.”“We’ve rehearsed it often enough—”“—over the last three hours.”And Minerva McGonagall, from where she stood at the speaker’spodium of the Head Table, looked down at the next name on her list.Please don’t let him be a Gryffindor please don’t let him be a Gryffindor OHPLEASE don’t let him be a Gryffindor… She took a deep breath, and called:“Potter, Harry!”There was a sudden silence in the hall as all whispered conversationstopped.A silence broken by a horrible buzzing noise that modulated andchanged in hideous mockery of musical melody.Minerva’s head jerked around, shocked, and identified the buzzingnoise as coming from the Gryffindor direction, where They were standingon top of the table blowing into some kind of tiny devices held against Theirlips. Her hand started to drop to her wand, to Silencio the lot of Them, butanother sound stopped her.Dumbledore was chuckling.Minerva’s eyes went back to Harry Potter, who had only just startedto step out of line before he’d stumbled and halted.Then the young boy began to walk again, moving his legs in oddsweeping motions, and waving his arms back and forth and snappinghis fingers, in synchrony with Their music.To the tune of “Ghostbusters”(As performed on the kazoo by Fred and George Weasley, and sung by LeeJordan.).There’s a Dark Lord near?Got no need to fearWho you gonna call?“Harry Potter!” shouted Lee Jordan, and the Weasley twins performed a triumphant chorus.With a Killing Curse?Well it could be worse.Who you gonna call?“Harry Potter!” There were a lot more voices shouting it this time.The Weasley Horrors went off into an extended wailing, now accompanied by some of the older Muggleborns, who had produced their owntiny devices, Transfigured out of the school silverware no doubt. As theirmusic reached its anticlimax, Harry Potter shouted:I ain’t afraid of Dark Lords!There was cheering then, especially from the Gryffindor table, andmore students produced their own antimusical instruments. Thehideous buzzings redoubled in volume and built to another awfulcrescendo:I ain’t afraid of Dark Lords!Minerva glanced to both sides of the Head Table, afraid to look butwith all too good a notion of what she would see.Trelawney frantically fanning herself, Flitwick looking on with curiosity, Hagrid clapping along to the music, Sprout looking severe, andQuirrell gazing at the boy with sardonic amusement. Directly to her left,Dumbledore humming along; and directly to her right, Snape grippinghis empty wine goblet, white-knuckled, so hard that the thick silver wasslowly deforming.Dark robes and a mask?Impossible task?Who you gonna call?Harry Potter!Giant Fire-Ape?Old bat in a cape?Who you gonna call?Harry Potter!Minerva’s lips set in a white line. She would have words with Themabout that last verse, if They thought she was powerless because it wasthe first day of school and Gryffindor had no points to take away. If Theydidn’t care about detentions then she would find something else.Then, with a sudden gasp of horror, she looked in Snape’s direction,surely he realised the Potter boy must have no idea who that was talkingabout—Snape’s face had gone beyond rage into a kind of pleasant indifference. A faint smile played about his lips. He was looking in the directionof Harry Potter, not the Gryffindor table, and his hands held the crumpled remains of a former wine goblet…And Harry walked forwards, sweeping his arms and legs through themotions of the Ghostbusters dance, keeping a smile on his face. It wasa great setup, had caught him completely by surprise. The least he coulddo was play along and not ruin it all.Everyone was cheering him. It made him feel all warm inside and sortof awful at the same time.They were cheering him for a job he’d done when he was one year old.A job he hadn’t really finished. Somewhere, somehow, the Dark Lord wasstill alive. Would they have been cheering quite so hard, if they knew that?But the Dark Lord’s power had been broken once.And Harry would protect them again. If there was in fact a prophecyand that was what it said. Well, actually regardless of what any darnprophecy said.All those people believing in him and cheering him—Harry couldn’tstand to let that be false. To flash and fade like so many other child prodigies. To be a disappointment. To fail to live up to his reputation as asymbol of the Light, never mind how he’d gotten it. He would absolutely,positively, no matter how long it took and even if it killed him, fulfill theirexpectations. And then go on to exceed those expectations, so that peoplewondered, looking back, that they had once asked so little of him.And he shouted out the lie that he’d invented because it scanned welland the song called for it:I ain’t afraid of Dark Lords!I ain’t afraid of Dark Lords!Harry took his last steps toward the Sorting Hat as the music ended.He swept a bow to the Order of Chaos at the Gryffindor table, and thenturned and swept another bow to the other side of the hall, and waitedfor the applause and giggling to die away…Omake Files IIIThe offer to tell the whole plot to anyone who guessed what ‘has neverhappened before’ spurred a lot of interesting attempts. The first omakebelow is taken directly from my personal favorite answer, by Meteoricshipyards. The second is based on Kazuma’s suggestion for what “hasnever happened before”, the third on a combination of yoyoente and dougal74, the fourth on wolf550e’s review of chapter 10. The one that startswith ‘K’, and the one just above that, are from DarkHeart81. The othersare my own. Anyone who wants to pick up one of my own ideas and runwith them, particularly the last one, is welcome to do so. And before I get100 indignant complaints, yes, I am well aware that the legislative bodyof the UK is the House of Commons in Parliament.…In the back of his mind, he wondered if the Sorting Hat was genuinelyconscious in the sense of being aware of its own awareness, and if so,whether it was satisfied with only getting to talk to eleven-year-olds onceper year. Its song had implied so: Oh, I’m the Sorting Hat and I’m okay, Isleep all year and I work one day…When there was once more silence in the room, Harry sat on the stooland carefully placed onto his head the 800-year-old telepathic artefact offorgotten magic.Thinking, just as hard as he could: Don’t Sort me yet! I have questions Ineed to ask you! Have I ever been Obliviated? Did you Sort the Dark Lord whenhe was a child and can you tell me about his weaknesses? Can you tell me why Igot the brother wand to the Dark Lord’s? Is the Dark Lord’s ghost bound to my scarand is that why I get so angry sometimes? Those are the most important questions,but if you’ve got another moment can you tell me anything about how to rediscoverthe lost magics that created you?And the Sorting Hat answered, “No. Yes. No. No. Yes and no, next timedon’t ask double questions. No.” and out loud, “RAVENCLAW!”“Oh, dear. This has never happened before…”What?“I’m allergic to your hair shampoo—”And then the Sorting Hat sneezed, with a mighty “A-CHOO!” thatechoed around the Great Hall.“Well!” Dumbledore cried jovially. “It seems Harry Potter has beensorted into the new House of Achoo! McGonagall, you can serve as theHead of House Achoo. You’d better hurry up on making arrangementsfor Achoo’s curriculum and classes, tomorrow is the first day!”“But, but, but,” stammered McGonagall, her mind in nearly completedisarray, “who will be Head of House Gryffindor?” It was all she couldthink of, she had to stop this somehow…Dumbledore put a finger to his cheek, looking thoughtful. “Snape.”Snape’s screech of protest nearly drowned out McGonagall’s, “Thenwho will be Head of Slytherin?”“Hagrid.”Don’t Sort me yet! I have questions I need to ask you! Have I ever been Obliviated?Did you Sort the Dark Lord when he was a child and can you tell me about hisweaknesses? Can you tell me why I got the brother wand to the Dark Lord’s? Isthe Dark Lord’s ghost bound to my scar and is that why I get so angry sometimes?Those are the most important questions, but if you’ve got another moment can youtell me anything about how to rediscover the lost magics that created you?There was a brief pause.Hello? Do I need to repeat the questions?The Sorting Hat screamed, an awful high-pitched sound that echoedthrough the Great Hall and caused most of the students to clap theirhands over their ears. With a desperate yowl, it leapt off Harry Potter’shead and bounded across the floor, pushing itself along with its brim,and made it halfway to the Head Table before it exploded.Seeing the look of horror on Harry Potter’s face, Fred Weasleythought faster than he ever had in his life. In a single motion he whippedout his wand, whispered “Silencio!” and then “Changemyvoiceio!” andfinally “Ventriliquo!”“Just kidding!” said Fred Weasley. “GRYFFINDOR!”“Oh, dear. This has never happened before…”What?“Ordinarily I would refer such questions to the Headmaster, who could askme in turn, if he wished. But some of the information you’ve asked for is not onlybeyond your own user level, but beyond the Headmaster’s.”How can I raise my user level?“I’m afraid I am not allowed to answer that question at your current userlevel.”What options are available at my user level?After that it didn’t take long—“Oh, dear. This has never happened before…”What?“I’ve had to tell students before that they were mothers—it would break yourheart to know what I saw in their minds—but this is the first time I’ve ever had totell someone they were a father.”“Draco Malfoy is carrying your baby.”“To repeat: Draco Malfoy is carrying your baby.”But we’re only eleven—“Actually, Draco is secretly thirteen years old.”B-b-but men can’t get pregnant—“And a girl under those clothes.”Harry Potter fainted. His unconscious body fell off the stool with adull thud.“RAVENCLAW!” called out the Hat from where it lay on top of hishead. That had been even funnier than its first idea.Huh? Harry remembered Draco mentioning a ‘House Elf’, but whatwas that exactly?Judging by the appalled looks dawning on the faces around him, itwasn’t anything good—“Oh, dear. This has never happened before…”What?“I’ve never Sorted someone who was a reincarnation of Godric GryffindorAND Salazar Slytherin AND Naruto.”1941 *“Fooled you again! HUFFLEPUFF! SLYTHERIN! HUFFLEPUFF!”At the Head Table, Dumbledore went on smiling benignly; small metallicsounds occasionally came from Snape’s direction as he idly compactedthe twisted remains of what had once been a heavy silver wine goblet;and Minerva McGonagall clenched the podium in a white-knuckled grip,knowing that Harry Potter’s contagious chaos had infected the SortingHat itself.Scenario after scenario played out through Minerva’s head, eachworse than the last. The Hat would say that Harry was too evenly balanced between Houses to Sort, and decide that he belonged to all of them.The Hat would proclaim that Harry’s mind was too strange to be Sorted.The Hat would demand that Harry be expelled from Hogwarts. The Hathad gone into a coma. The Hat would insist that a whole new House ofDoom be created just to accomodate Harry Potter, and Dumbledore wouldmake her do it…Minerva remembered what Harry had told her in that disastrous tripto Diagon Alley, about the… planning fallacy, she thought it had been…and how people were usually too optimistic, even when they thought theywere being pessimistic. It was the sort of information that preyed on yourmind, dwelling in it and spinning off nightmares…But what was the worst that could happen?Well… in the worst-case scenario, the Hat would assign Harry to a wholenew House. Dumbledore would insist that she do it—create a whole newHouse just for him—and she’d have to rearrange all the class scheduleson the first day of term. And Dumbledore would remove her as Head ofHouse Gryffindor, and give her beloved House over to… Professor Binns,the History ghost; and she would be assigned as Head of Harry’s Houseof Doom; and she would futilely try to give the child orders, deductingpoint after point without effect, while disaster after disaster was blamedon her.Was that the worst-case scenario?Minerva honestly didn’t see how it could be any worse than that.And even in the very worst case—no matter what happened withHarry—it would all be over in seven years.Minerva felt her knuckles slowly relax their white-knuckled grip onthe podium. Harry had been right, there was a kind of comfort in staringdirectly into the furthest depths of the darkness, knowing that you hadconfronted your worst fears and were now prepared.The frightened silence was broken by a single word.“Headmaster!” called the Sorting Hat.At the Head Table, Dumbledore rose, his face puzzled. “Yes?” he addressed the Hat. “What is it?”“I wasn’t talking to you,” said the Hat. “I was Sorting Harry Potter intothe place in Hogwarts where he most belongs, namely the Headmaster’soffice—”ofLordtheRatîonalîtYFrodo glanced at all the faces, but they were not turned to him. All theCouncil sat with downcast eyes, as if in deep thought. A great dread fellon him, as if he was awaiting the pronouncement of some doom thathe had long foreseen and vainly hoped might after all never be spoken.An overwhelming longing to rest and remain at peace by Bilbo’s side inRivendell filled all his heart. At last with an effort he spoke, and wonderedto hear his own words, as if some other will was using his small voice.“We cannot,” said Frodo. “We must not. Do you not see? It is exactlywhat the Enemy desires. All of this he has foreseen.”The faces turned to him, puzzled the Dwarves and grave the Elves;sternness in the eyes of the Men; and so keen the gazes of Elrond and ofGandalf that Frodo almost could not withstand it. It was very hard, then,not to grasp the Ring in his hand, and harder still not to put it on, to facethem as only Frodo.“Do you not question it?” Frodo said, thin like the wind his voice, andwavering like a breeze. “You have chosen, of all things, to send the Ringinto Mordor; should you not wonder? How did it come to this? That wemight, of all our choices, do that single thing our Enemy most desires?Perhaps the Cracks of Doom are already guarded, strongly enough to holdoff Gandalf and Elrond and Glorfindel all together; or perhaps the Masterof that place has cooled the lava there, set it to trap the Ring so that he maysimply bring it out after it is thrown in…” A memory of awful clarity cameover Frodo then, and a flash of black laughter, and the thought came tohim that it was just what the Enemy would do. Only the thought came tohim so: thus it would amuse me to do, if I meant to rule…There were doubtful glances exchanged within the council; Glóin andGimli and Boromir were now looking at the Elves more skeptically thanbefore, like they had awoken out of a dream of words.“The Enemy is very wise,” said Gandalf, “and weighs all things to anicety in the scales of his malice. But the only measure that he knows isdesire, desire for power; and so he judges all hearts. Into his heart thethought will not enter that any will refuse it, that having the Ring we mayseek to destroy it—”“He will think of it!” cried Frodo. He struggled for words, trying toconvey things that had once seemed perfect in his comprehension, andthen faded like melting snow. “If the Enemy thought that all his foes weremoved by desire for power alone—he would guess wrongly, over and over,and the Maker of this Ring would see that, he would know that somewherehe had made a mistake!” Frodo’s hands stretched forth pleadingly.Boromir stirred, and his voice was doubtful. “You speak fair of theEnemy,” said Boromir, “for one of his foes.”Frodo’s mouth opened and shut in desperate bewilderment; for Frodoknew, he knew the Man was mad, but he could think of nothing to say.Then Bilbo spoke, and his withered voice silenced the whole room,even Elrond who had been about to speak. “Frodo is right, I fear,” whispered the old hobbit. “I remember, I remember what it was like. To seewith the Black Sight. I remember. The Enemy will think that we mightnot trust one another, that the weaker among us will propose to destroythe Ring so that the stronger may not have it. He knows that even onenot truly good might still cry to destroy the Ring, to make a show of pretended goodness. And the Enemy will not think it impossible that such adecision be made by this council, for you see, he does not trust us to bewise.” A whispering chuckle rose from the ancient hobbit’s throat. “Andif he did—why, he would still guard the Cracks of Doom. It would costhim little.”Now foreboding was on the faces even of the Elves, and the Wise; Elrond had frowned, and the sharp eyebrows of Gandalf furrowed.Frodo gazed at them all, feeling a wildness come over him, a despair;and as his heart weakened a shadow came over his vision, a darkness anda wavering. From within the shadow Frodo saw Gandalf, and the wizard’sstrength was revealed as weakness, and his wisdom folly. For Frodo knew,as the Ring seemed to drag and weigh on his breast, that Gandalf hadnot thought at all of history and lore, when the wizard spoke of how theEnemy would not understand any desire save power; that Gandalf hadnot remembered how Sauron had cast down and corrupted the Men ofNúmenor in the days of their glory. Just as it had not occurred to Gandalfthat the Enemy might learn to comprehend foes of goodwill by looking…Frodo’s gaze swung to Elrond, but there was no hope there, no answer and no rescue in the shadowy vision; for Elrond had let Isildur go,carrying the Ring from the Cracks of Doom where it should have beendestroyed, to the cost of all this war. Not for Isildur’s own sake, not forfriendship had it been done, for the Ring had killed Isildur in the end,and far worse fates could have followed him. But the Doom that hadstemmed from Isildur’s deed would have seemed unsure to Elrond then,unsure and distant in time; and yet the cost to Elrond himself of takinghis sword’s pommel to the back of Isildur’s head would have been surer,and nearer…As though in desperation, Frodo turned to look at Aragorn, the weathered man who had donned his travel-worn clothes for this council, theheir of kings who spoke softly to hobbits. But Frodo’s vision seemed todouble, and in the shadowy second image Frodo saw a Man who hadspent too much of his youth among Elves, who had learned to wearhumble and stained clothes amid the gold and jewels, knowing he couldnot match them wisdom for wisdom, and hoping to outplay them in afashion they would not emulate…In the sight of the Ring, which was the sight of the Ring’s own Maker,all noble things faded into stratagems and lies, a world of grey anddarkness without any light. They had not made their choices knowingly,Gandalf or Elrond or Aragorn; the impulses had come from the darkhidden parts of themselves, the black secret depths which the Ring hadrendered plain in Frodo’s vision. Would they outthink the Shadow, whenthey could not comprehend even their own selves, or the forces thatmoved them?“Frodo!” came the sharp whisper of Bilbo’s voice, and Frodo came tohimself, and halted his hand reaching up toward where the Ring lay onhis breast, on its chain, dragging like a vast stone around his neck.Reaching up to grasp the Ring wherein all answers lay.“How did you bear this thing?” Frodo whispered to Bilbo, as if the twoof them were the only souls in the room, though all the Council watchedthem. “For years? I cannot imagine it.”“I kept it locked in a room to which only Gandalf had the key,” saidhis uncle, “and when I began to imagine ways to open it, I rememberedGollum.”A shudder went through Frodo, remembering the tales. The horrorof the Misty Mountains, thinking, always thinking in the dark; ruling thegoblins from the shadows and filling the tunnels with traps; but for Bilbowearing the ring that first time not a single dwarf would have lived. Andnow, Legolas the Elf had told them, Gollum had given up on sending hisagents against the Shire, had at last found the courage to leave his mountains and seek the Ring himself. That was Gollum, the fate which Frodowould share himself, if the Ring were not destroyed.Only they had no way to destroy the Ring.The Shadow had foreseen every move they could make. Had almost—Frodo still could not imagine how it had been done, how the Shadow hadarranged such a thing—had almost maneuvered the Council into sendingthe Ring straight into Mordor with only a tiny guard set on it, as theywould have done if Frodo and Bilbo had not been there.And having foregone that swiftest of all possible defeats, the onlyquestion remaining was how long it would take to lose. Gandalf haddelayed too long, delayed far too long to set this march in motion. Itcould have been so easy, if only Bilbo had set out eighty years earlier,if only Bilbo had been told what Gandalf had already suspected, if onlyGandalf’s heart had not silently flinched away from the prospect of beingembarrassingly wrong…Frodo’s hand spasmed on his breast; without thought, his fingers began to rise again toward the vast weight of the chain on which the Ringhung.All he had to do was put on the Ring.Just that, and all would become clear to him, once more the slownessand mud would leave his thoughts, all possibilities and futures transparent to him, he would see through the Shadow’s plans and devise an irresistible counterstroke——and he would never be able to take off the Ring, not again, not byany will that would be left to him. All Frodo had of those moments werefading memories, but he knew that it had felt like dying, to let all his towers of thought collapse and become only Frodo once more. It had felt likedying, he remembered that much of Weathertop even if he rememberedlittle else. And if he did wear the Ring again, it would be better to die withit on his finger, to end his life while he was still himself; for Frodo knewthat he could not withstand the effects of wearing the Ring a second time,not afterward when the limitless clarity was lost to him…Frodo looked around the Council, at the poor lost leaderless Wise, andhe knew they could not defeat the Shadow by their own strength.“I will wear it one last time,” Frodo said, his voice broken and failing,as he had known from the beginning that he would say in the end, “onelast time to find the answer for this Council, and then there will be otherhobbits.”“No!” screamed the voice of Sam, as the other hobbit began to rushforward from where he had hidden; even as Frodo, with movement asswift and precise as a Nazgûl, took out the Ring from beneath his shirt;and somehow Bilbo was already standing there and had already thrusthis finger through.It all happened before even Gandalf’s staff could point, beforeAragorn could level the hilt-shard of his sword; the Dwarves shoutedin shock, and the Elves were dismayed.“Of course,” said Bilbo’s voice, as Frodo began to weep, “I see it now, Iunderstand everything at last. Listen, listen and swiftly, here is what youmust do—”With a critical eye, Peter looked over the encamped Centaurs with theirbows, Beavers with their long daggers, and talking Bears with their chainmail draped over them. He was in charge, because he was one of the mythical Sons of Adam and had declared himself High King of Narnia; but thetruth was he didn’t really know much about encampments, weapons, andguard patrols. In the end all he could see was that they all looked proudand confident, and Peter had to hope they were right about that; becauseif you couldn’t believe in your own people, you couldn’t believe in anyone.“They’d scare me, if I had to fight ’em,” Peter said finally, “but I don’tknow if it’s enough to beat… her.”“You don’t suppose this mysterious lion will actually show up and helpus, d’you?” said Lucy. Her voice was very quiet, so that none of the creatures around them would hear. “Only it’d be nice to really have him, don’tyou think, instead of just letting people think that he put us in charge?”Susan shook her head, shaking the magical arrows in the quiver onher back. “If there was really someone like that,” Susan said, “he wouldn’thave let the White Witch cover the land in winter for a hundred years,would he?”“I had the strangest dream,” Lucy said, her voice even quieter, “wherewe didn’t have to organize any creatures or convince them to fight, wejust walked into this place and the lion was already here, with all thearmies already mustered, and he went and rescued Edmund, and thenwe rode alongside him into this tremendous battle where he killed theWhite Witch…”“Did the dream have a moral?” said Peter.“I don’t know,” said Lucy, blinking and looking a little puzzled. “Inthe dream it all seemed pointless somehow.”“I think maybe the land of Narnia was trying to tell you,” said Susan,“or maybe it was just your own dreams trying to tell you, that if there wasreally such a person as that lion, there’d be no use for us.”“Applejack, who told me outright that I was mistaken, represents thespirit of… honesty! ” Twilight Sparkle raised her head even higher, maneblowing like a wind about the dusky sky of her neck. “Fluttershy, whoapproached the manticore to find out about the thorn in its paw, represents the spirit of… investigation! Pinkie Pie, who realized that theawful faces were just trees, represents the spirit of… formulating alternative hypotheses! Rarity, who solved the serpent’s problem represents thespirit of… creativity! Rainbow Dash, who saw through the false offer ofher heart’s desire, represents the spirit of… analysis! Marie-Susan, whomade us convince her that we were right before she agreed to come onour expedition, represents the spirit of… peer review! And when thoseElements are ignited by the spark of curiosity that resides in the heart ofall of us, it creates the seventh element—the Element of Sci-”The blast of power that came forth was like a wind of moonless night,it caught Marie-Susan before the pony could even flinch, and she wasgone without a trace before any of them had the chance to rear in shock.From the dark thing that stood in the center of the dais where theElements had shattered, from the scarce-recognizable void-black outlineof a horse, came a voice that seemed to bypass all ears and burn like coldfire, sounding directly in the brain of everypony who heard:Did you expect me to just stand there and let you finish?Twilight Sparkle stared at the space where Marie-Susan had been,where not a trace of the unicorn remained. She—she just—she— In theback of her mind, unheard, she was aware that Rarity was screaming.That wasn’t a disintegration, said the voice of Nightmare. I sent her somewhere else.Rarity’s scream stopped abruptly.Twilight Sparkle felt like her own scream was only beginning. Seven.It took seven ponies to use the Elements of Inquiry. Everyone knewthat no matter how honest, investigating, skeptical, creative, analytic,or curious you were, what really made your work Science was when youpublished your results in a prestigious journal. Everyone knew that.1951 *Could there be more than one Element of Peer Review at a time—howlong would it take to find another one—and the Nightmare wouldn’t juststand there and let them do it—“Where?” yelled Rainbow Dash. “Where’d you put her?”I put the little pony in the same place I bound my pathetic sister, in the heartof her pathetic Sun.“She’ll die!” cried Fluttershy, staring at the Nightmare in horror. “It’stoo hot, she’ll burn!”Oh, don’t worry. The power of the Nightmare surrounds your little friend,keeping her safe and cool, sustaining her without food or drink. She will suffernothing more than boredom…The void-black outline stepped off the dais, walking slowly, deliberately, past the remaining six ponies.…so long as the Nightmare’s power is not broken. By any backup plans mysister may have set in motion, for example, and which may be known to you. Inthat case she will vaporize instantly. Such a lovely thing, friendship. It makessuch a wonderful instrument of blackmail. Be sure to keep safe the Elements ofInquiry. You wouldn’t want anyone else using them on me, now would you?“No,” whispered Twilight Sparkle, as the horror began to dawn on her.Then a crawling sensation all over her skin, as the Nightmare walkedpast her, and the deadly power brushed her with its cold caress.Now if you’ll pardon me, my little ponies, I have an eternal night to rule over.“Consider the computational power required to manifest over a hundredshadow clones,” the Uchiha genius said in his dispassionate tones. “It isan error of rationality, Sakura, to say ‘fluke’ and think you have explainedanything. ‘Fluke’ is simply the name one gives to data that one is ignoring.”“But it has to be a fluke!” Sakura yelled. With effort, she calmed hervoice into the careful precision expected of a rationality ninja; it wouldn’tdo to have her crush think she was stupid. “Like you said, the computational power required to use over a hundred Kage Bunshin is simply absurd. We’re talking the level of a major superintelligence. Naruto’s thedead last of our class. He’s not even jounin-level smart, let alone a superintelligence!”The Uchiha’s eyes gleamed, almost as though he had activated hisSmartingan. “Naruto can manifest a hundred independently actingclones. He must have the raw brainpower. But, under ordinary circumstances, something prevents him from using this computational powerefficiently… like a mind at war within itself, perhaps? We now have causeto believe that Naruto is in some way connected to a superintelligence,and as a recently graduated genin, he, like us, is fifteen years old. Whathappened fifteen years ago, Sakura?”It took a moment for Sakura to comprehend, to remember, and thenshe understood.The attack of the Nine-Brains Demon Fox.Just a small bone-white creature with big ears and bigger tail andbeady red eyes. It was no stronger than an ordinary fox, it didn’t breathefire or flash laser eyes, it possessed no chakra and no magic of any kind,but its intelligence was over nine thousand times that of a human being.Hundreds had been killed, half the buildings wrecked, almost thewhole village of Beisugakure had been destroyed.“You think the Kyubey is hiding inside Naruto?” Sakura said. A moment later, her brain automatically went on to fill in the obvious implications of the theory. “And the software conflict between their existences iswhy he acts like a gibbering idiot half the time, but can control a hundredKage Bunshin. Huh. That makes… a lot of sense… actually…”Sasuke gave her the brief, contemptuous nod of someone who hadfigured all this out on his own, without anyone else needing to prompthim.“Ano…” said Sakura. Only years of sanity exercises channeled hercomplete screaming panic into pragmatically useful policy options.“Shouldn’t we… tell someone about this? Like, sometime in the next fiveseconds?”“The adults already know,” Sasuke said emotionlessly. “It is the obvious explanation for their treatment of Naruto. No, the real question ishow this fits into the outwitting of the Uchiha…”“I don’t see how it fits at all—” began Sakura.“It must fit!” A tinge of frantic emotion flickered in Sasuke’s voice. “Iasked that man why he did it, and he told me that when I knew the answerto that, it would explain everything! Surely this must also be part of whatis to be explained!”Sakura sighed to herself. Her personal hypothesis was that Itachi hadjust been trying to drive his brother into clinical paranoia.“Yo, kids,” said the voice of their rationality sensei from their radioearpieces. “There’s a village in Wave trying to build a bridge, and it keepsfalling down for no reason anyone can figure out. Meet up at the gates atnoon. It’s time for your first C-ranked analysis mission.”(This has now inspired an extended fanfiction, _Lighting Up the Dark_ byVelorien.)“How could you do it, Anita?” said Richard, his voice very tight. “Howcould you coauthor a paper with Jean-Claude? You study the undead, youdon’t collaborate with them on papers!”“And what about you?” I spat. “You coauthored a paper with Sylvie!It’s all right for you to be prolific but not me?”“I’m the head of her institute,” Richard growled. I could feel the wavesof science radiating off him; he was angry. “I have to work with Sylvie, itdoesn’t mean anything! I thought our own research was special, Anita!”“It is,” I said, feeling helpless about my inability to explain things toRichard. He didn’t understand the thrill of being a polymath, the newworlds that were opening up to me. “I didn’t share our research withanyone—”“But you wanted to,” said Richard.I didn’t say anything, but I knew that the look on my face said it all.“God, Anita, you’ve changed,” said Richard. He seemed to slump in onhimself. “Do you realize that the monsters are joking about Blake numbers, now? I used to be your partner in everything, and now—I’m justanother werewolf with a Blake number of 1.”ThunderSmarts“I am sick of this!” shouted Liono. “Sick of doing this every single week! Ourspecies was capable of interstellar travel, Panthro, I know the quantitiesof energy involved! There is no way you can’t build a nuke or steer anasteroid or somehow blow up that ever-living idiot’s pyramid!”He-Man and the Masters of Rationality“Fabulous secret knowledge was revealed to me on the day I held aloftmy magic book and said: By the power of Bayes’s Theorem!”The eleven-year-old boy who would someday become legend—slayer ofdragons, killer of kings—had but one thought upon his mind, as he approached the Sorting Hat to enter into the study of mysteries.Anywhere but Ravenclaw anywhere but Ravenclaw oh please anywhere butRavenclaw…But no sooner the brim of the ancient felted device slipped over hisforehead—As the table decked in blue began to applaud him, as he approachedthe dread table where he would spend the next seven years, Kvothe wasalready wincing inside, waiting for the inevitable; and the inevitable happened almost at once, exactly as he had feared it, before he’d even had achance to sit down properly.“So!” an older boy said with the happy expression of someone who’sthought of something terribly clever. “Kvothe the Raven, huh?”I have a truly marvelous story for this crossover which this margin is toonarrow to contain.Utilitarian Twilight(Note: Written after I heard Alicorn was writing a Twilight fanfic, but beforeI read _Luminosity_. It’s obvious if you’re one of us.)“Edward,” said Isabella tenderly. She reached up a hand and stroked hiscold, sparkling cheek. “You don’t have to protect me from anything. I’velisted out all the upsides and all the downsides, assigned them consistentrelative weights, and it’s just really obvious that the benefits of becominga vampire outweigh the drawbacks.”“Bella,” Edward said, and swallowed desperately. “Bella—”“Immortality. Perfect health. Awakening psychic powers. Easyenough to survive on animal blood once you do it. Even the beauty, Edward, there are people who would give their lives to be pretty, and don’tyou dare call them shallow until you’ve tried being ugly. Do you think I’mscared of the word ‘vampire’? I’m tired of your arbitrary deontologicalconstraints, Edward. The whole human species ought to be in on yourfun, and people are dying by the thousands even as you hesitate.”The gun in his lover’s hand was cold against his forehead. It wouldn’tkill him, but it would disable him for long enough—Aladdin JasmineAladdin’s face was wistful, but determined, as the newly minted streeturchin addressed the blue being of cosmic power for one last time, prepared to leave behind the wealth and hope he had so briefly tasted for thesake of his friend. “Genie, I make my third wish. I wish for you to be—”Princess Jasmine, who had been staring at this with her mouth open,not quite believing what she was seeing, just barely managed to overcomeher paralysis and yank the lamp out of the boy’s hand before he could finish the fatal sentence.“Excuse me,” said Jasmine. “Aladdin, my darling, you’re cute butyou’re an idiot, do you know that? Did you not notice how once Jafar gothis hands on this lamp, he got his own three wishes—oh, never mind.Genie, I wish for everyone to always be young and healthy, I wish nobodyever had to die if they didn’t want to, and I wish for everyone’s intelligence to gradually increase at a rate of 1 IQ point per year.” She tossedthe lamp back to Aladdin. “Go back to what you were doing.”Prince Hamlet and the Philosopher’s StoneInterloper, abandon this strange prank,which makes cruel use of the blindness of my grief,and the good heart of my good friend Horatio.Or else, if thou hast true title to this belov’d form,tell me:What drawing did I present to Hamlet King,when six years old and scarce out of my sling?’twas a unicorn clad all in mail.What.Mark me.Father, I will.My hour is almost come,When I to sulphurous and tormenting flamesMust render up myself.Thou art in torment?Ay, as are all who die unshriven.Like every Dane this is what I’ve been taught.Yet I did figure such caprice ill-suited to almighty God.For all who suffer unlook’d for deaths, unattended by God’s chosenpriests,to be then punish’d for the ill-ordering of the world…’twas not the world that killed me, nor accident of any kind.What?If thou didst ever thy dear father love,Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.Oh God.My time grows ever shorter.

No, I decided I’d justget on with my life.”Alice was sitting by her sister on the bank, reading a book. She had severalfriends who were older, and if she just asked nicely, they were often happyto lend her books without quite so many pictures and conversations as wasthought appropriate for a girl her age.Hot days often made her feel sleepy and stupid, so Alice had thoughtfully wet a handkerchief and placed it at the back of her neck. Still hermind had gone off wandering (just as if it was some little kitten whoseowner had taken off her eyes for just a moment), and she had just decidedthat the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth around 4/3 ofthe trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, which was nonethelessnot equal to the opportunity cost of putting down her book, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor, in fact, did Alicethink it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Ohdear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” But when the Rabbit actually took a watchout of its waistcoat—pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice frozein sudden clarity and fear, for she had never before seen a rabbit witheither a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it. “Oh bother,” she1961 *said to herself (though not aloud; she had long since cured herself of thathabit, as it made people take her even less seriously than they already did).“If I did not immediately recognize how much curiouser that was than theaverage rabbit, then something is interfering with my curiosity, and thatis most curious of all.” So, burning with questions, she ran across thefield after it, and was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-holeunder the hedge.MORPHEUS: For the longest time, I wouldn’t believe it. But then I sawthe fields with my own eyes, watched them liquefy the dead so they couldbe fed intravenously to the living—NEO (politely): Excuse me, please.MORPHEUS: Yes, Neo?NEO: I’ve kept quiet for as long as I could, but I feel a certain needto speak up at this point. The human body is the most inefficient sourceof energy you could possibly imagine. The efficiency of a power plantat converting thermal energy into electricity decreases as you run the turbines at lower temperatures. If you had any sort of food humans couldeat, it would be more efficient to burn it in a furnace than feed it to humans. And now you’re telling me that their food is the bodies of the dead, fedto the living? Haven’t you ever heard of the laws of thermodynamics?MORPHEUS: Where did you hear about the laws of thermodynamics,Neo?NEO: Anyone who’s made it past one science class in high schoolought to know about the laws of thermodynamics!MORPHEUS: Where did you go to high school, Neo?(Pause.)NEO: …in the Matrix.MORPHEUS: The machines tell elegant lies.(Pause.)NEO (in a small voice): Could I please have a real physics textbook?MORPHEUS: There is no such thing, Neo. The universe doesn’t runon math.The following was posted at the end of Chapter 113:This is your final exam.You have 60 hours.Your solution must at least allow Harry to evade immediate death, despitebeing naked, holding only his wand, facing 36 Death Eaters plus the fullyresurrected Lord Voldemort.If a viable solution is posted before *12:01AM Pacific Time* (8:01AM UTC)on Tuesday, March 3rd, 2015, the story will continue to Ch. 121.Otherwise you will get a shorter and sadder ending.Keep in mind the following:1. Harry must succeed via his own efforts. The cavalry is not coming. Everyone who might want to help Harry thinks he is at a Quidditch game.2. Harry may only use capabilities the story has already shown him tohave; he cannot develop wordless wandless Legilimency in the next 60seconds.3. Voldemort is evil and cannot be persuaded to be good; the Dark Lord’sutility function cannot be changed by talking to him.4. If Harry raises his wand or speaks in anything except Parseltongue, theDeath Eaters will fire on him immediately.5. If the simplest timeline is otherwise one where Harry dies—if Harrycannot reach his Time-Turner without Time-Turned help—then theTime-Turner will not come into play.6. It is impossible to tell lies in Parseltongue.Within these constraints, Harry is allowed to attain his full potential as arationalist, now in this moment or never, regardless of his previous flaws.Of course ‘the rational solution’, if you are using the word ‘rational’ correctly, is just a needlessly fancy way of saying ‘the best solution’ or ‘thesolution I like’ or ‘the solution I think we should use’, and you should usually say one of the latter instead. (We only need the word ‘rational’ to talkabout ways of thinking, considered apart from any particular solutions.)And by Vinge’s Principle, if you know exactly what a smart mind would do,you must be at least that smart yourself. Asking someone “What wouldan optimal player think is the best move?” should produce answers nobetter than “What do you think is best?”So what I mean in practice, when I say Harry is allowed to attain his fullpotential as a rationalist, is that Harry is allowed to solve this problem theway YOU would solve it. If you can tell me exactly how to do something,Harry is allowed to think of it.But it does not serve as a solution to say, for example, “Harry should persuade Voldemort to let him out of the box” if you can’t yourself figure outhow.The rules on Fanfiction dot Net allow at most one review per chapter.Please submit *ONLY ONE* review of Ch. 113, to submit one suggestedsolution.For the best experience, if you have not already been following Internetconversations about recent chapters, I suggest not doing so, trying tocomplete this exam on your own, not looking at other reviews, and wait* 1964 *ing for Ch. 114 to see how you did.I wish you all the best of luck, or rather the best of skill.Ch. 114 will post at 10AM Pacific (6PM UTC) on Tuesday, March 3rd, 2015.If you have pending exams, then even though the bystander effect is athing, I expect that the collective effect of ‘everyone with more urgent lifeissues stays out of the effort’ shifts the probabilities very little (becausediminishing marginal returns on more eyes and an already-huge population that is participating).So if you can’t take the time, then please don’t. Like any author, I enjoythe delicious taste of my readers’ suffering, finer than any chocolate; butI don’t want to *hurt* you.Likewise, if you hate hate hate this sort of thing, then don’t participate!Other people ARE enjoying it. Just come back in a few days. I shouldn’teven need to point this out.I remind you again that you have hours to think. Use the Hold Off OnProposing Solutions, Luke.And really truly, I do mean it, Harry cannot develop any new magical powers or transcend previously stated constraints on them in the next sixtyseconds.Unsurprisingly, this led to a lot of reader submissions. An awful lot.You can see the fallout on the /r/HPMOR subreddit. If you’re reading this somewhere that the previous text isn’t a link, you can go tohttp://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR and search for “Help!
