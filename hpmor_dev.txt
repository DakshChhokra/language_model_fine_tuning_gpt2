The burning sensation was creeping up her throat, and when itreached her eyes she would burst into tears, and from then on she wouldbe just a crying little girl to both of them.“That—” Harry’s voice said urgently, she wasn’t looking at him but hisvoice sounded like he had his head turned toward her. “That was—I trieda lot harder that time, there was an important reason, I had to, so I useda whole bunch of tricks I’d been saving up—and—”She’d always been trying her hardest, every time.“—and I, I let out a side of myself I wouldn’t usually use for somethinglike Defense class—”So if she ever got close to winning against Harry when it really mattered, he could just go into his dark side and crush her, was that it?…of course it was. She couldn’t even look Harry in the eyes when hewas being scary, how had she ever thought she could beat him for real?The corridor forked, and Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy went left toward a staircase that climbed to the second floor, and she went right instead, she didn’t even know where that passage went but right now she’drather be lost in the castle.“Excuse me, Draco,” said Harry’s voice, and then there was a patteringof footsteps behind her.“Leave me alone,” she said, it came out sounding stern but then shehad to shut her mouth and press her lips together tightly and hold herbreath to stop it all from coming out.That boy just kept on coming, and ran around her and put himselfin front of her, because he was stupid that was why, and Harry said, hisvoice now a high and desperate whisper, “I didn’t run away when you werebeating me in all my classes except broomstick riding!”He didn’t understand, and he would never understand, Harry Potter would never understand, because no matter what contest he lost hewould still be the Boy-Who-Lived, if you were Harry Potter and Hermione Granger was beating you then it meant everyone was expecting youto rise to the challenge, if you were Hermione Granger and Harry Potterwas beating you that meant you were just no one.“It’s not fair,” she said, her voice was shaking but she wasn’t crying yet,not yet, “I shouldn’t have to fight your dark side, I’m just—I’m only—” I’monly twelve, that was what she thought then.“I only used my dark side once and that was—when I had to!”“So today you beat my whole army being just Harry?” She still wasn’tcrying yet, and she wondered what her face looked like right now, if shelooked like an angry Hermione or a sad one.“I—” Harry said. His voice got a little lower, “I wasn’t… really expectingto win, that time, I know I said I was invincible but that was just to try toscare you, I really just thought we’d slow you down for a bit—”She started walking again, walked right past him, and as she passedHarry’s face tightened up like he was going to cry.“Is Professor Quirrell right?” came a high desperate whisper from behind her. “If I have you for a friend, will I always be afraid to do betterbecause I know it will hurt your feelings? That’s not fair, Hermione!”She took a breath and held it and ran, her feet pattering across thestone as fast as they could, running as fast as she dared with her visionall blurry, ran so that no one would hear her, and this time Harry didn’tfollow.Minerva was going over the Transfiguration parchment due Monday,and had just marked down to negative two hundred points a fifth-yearparchment with an error that could have potentially killed someone. During her first year as a professor she’d been indignant at the folly of olderstudents, now she was just resigned. Some people not only never learned,they never noticed that they were hopeless, they stayed bright and eagerand kept on trying. Sometimes they believed you when you told them,before they left Hogwarts, that they must never try anything unusual,give up free Transfiguration and use the art only through establishedCharms; and sometimes… they didn’t.She was in the middle of trying to unravel a particularly convolutedanswer when a knock at the door disrupted her thoughts; and it wasn’ther office hours, but it had only taken a very short time as Head of Gryffindor House for her to learn to suspend judgment. You could alwaysdeduct House points afterward.“Come in,” she said in a crisp voice.The young girl who entered her office had clearly been crying, andthen afterward had washed her face in hopes it wouldn’t show—“Miss Granger!” said Professor McGonagall. It had taken her a moment to recognize that face with its eyes reddened and cheeks puffed.“What happened?”“Professor,” said the young girl in a wavering voice, “you said that if Iwas ever worried or uncomfortable about anything, I should come to youat once—”“Yes,” said Professor McGonagall, “now what happened?”The girl started to explain—Hermione stood still and the stairs turned around her, a revolving helixthat shouldn’t have taken her anywhere at all, and instead bore her continuously upward. Hermione thought it seemed like the Enchantment ofthe Endless Stair, which had been invented in 1733 by the wizard ArramSabeti who’d lived on top of Mount Everest in the days when no Mugglescould climb it. Only that couldn’t be right because Hogwarts was mucholder—maybe the enchantment had been reinvented?She should’ve been frightened, should’ve been nervous about her second meeting with the Headmaster.She was, in fact, frightened and nervous about her second meetingwith the Headmaster.Only Hermione Granger had been thinking; she’d been thinking a lot,after she hadn’t been able to run any further and had slid down againstthe wall with her lungs on fire, thinking while she curled up in a ball withher back against the chilly stone wall and her legs drawn up and crying.Even if she lost to Harry Potter she was never, ever going to lose toDraco Malfoy, that was just totally absolutely unacceptable, and ProfessorQuirrell had praised General Malfoy for not ignoring his thousand alternatives; and so after Hermione had cried herself out she’d thought of fourteen other spells she should’ve tried against Harry and Neville, and thenshe’d started wondering if she might be making the same sort of mistakeabout other things; and that was how she’d ended up knocking on Professor McGonagall’s door. Not asking for help, right now Hermione didn’thave any plans she could ask for help with, just telling Professor McGonagall everything, because when she’d thought of it that had seemed likeone of the thousand alternatives that Professor Quirrell had been talkingabout.And she’d told Professor McGonagall about how Harry Potter hadchanged since the day the phoenix had been on his shoulder, and abouthow people more and more seemed to see her as just something ofHarry’s, and how it seemed like Harry was pulling farther and fartheraway from everyone else in their school year and went around with a sadair sometimes like he was losing something, and she didn’t know what todo anymore.And Professor McGonagall had told her that they needed to talk to theHeadmaster.And Hermione had felt worried, but then the thought had come toher that Harry Potter wouldn’t have been scared of the Headmaster. HarryPotter would have just barged ahead doing whatever he was trying to do.Maybe (the thought had come to her) it was worth trying to be like that,not being scared, just doing whatever, and seeing what happened to her,it couldn’t really be worse.The Endless Stair stopped turning.The great oaken door in front of them with the brass griffin knockeropened without being touched.Behind a black oaken desk with dozens of drawers facing in everydirection, looking like it had drawers set inside other drawers, was thesilver-bearded Headmaster of Hogwarts upon his throne, Albus PercivalWulfric Brian Dumbledore, into whose gently twinkling eyes Hermionelooked for around three seconds before she was distracted by all the otherthings in the room.Some time later—she wasn’t sure how long but it was while she wastrying to count the number of things in the room for the third time andstill not getting the same answer, even though her memory insisted thatnothing had been added or removed—the Headmaster cleared his throatand said, “Miss Granger?”Hermione’s head snapped around, and she felt a little heat in hercheeks; but Dumbledore didn’t appear annoyed with her at all, onlyserene, and with an inquiring look in those mild, half-glassed eyes.“Hermione,” said Professor McGonagall, the older witch’s voice wasgentle and her hand rested reassuringly on Hermione’s shoulder, “pleasetell the Headmaster what you said to me about Harry.”Hermione began speaking, despite her newfound resolution hervoice still stumbled a little with nervousness, as she described how Harryhad changed in the last few weeks since Fawkes had been on his shoulder.When she was done there was a pause, and then the Headmastersighed. “I am sorry, Hermione Granger,” said Dumbledore. Those blueeyes had grown sadder as she spoke. “That is… unfortunate, but I cannotsay it is unexpected. That is a hero’s burden, which you see.”“A hero?” said Hermione. She looked up nervously at Professor McGonagall and saw that the Transfiguration Professor’s face had grown tight,though her hand still squeezed Hermione’s shoulder reassuringly.“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “I was a hero myself once, before I was a mysterious old wizard, in the days when I opposed Grindelwald. You haveread history books, Miss Granger?”Hermione nodded.“Well,” said Dumbledore, “that is what heroes have to do, Miss Granger, they have their tasks and they must grow strong to accomplish them,and that is what you see happening to Harry. If there is anything that canbe done to gentle his pathway, then you will be the one to do it, and not I.For I am not Harry’s friend, alas, but only his mysterious old wizard.”“I—” said Hermione. “I’m not sure—I still want to be—” Her voicestopped, it seemed too awful to say aloud.Dumbledore closed his eyes, and when he opened them, he looked alittle older than before. “No one can stop you, Miss Granger, if you chooseto stop being Harry’s friend. As for what it would do to him, you mayknow that better than I.”“That—doesn’t seem fair,” Hermione said, her voice trembling. “ThatI’ve got to be Harry’s friend because he’s got no one else? That doesn’tseem fair.”“Being a friend is not something you can be forced to, Miss Granger.”The blue eyes seemed to look right through her. “The feelings are there,or they are not. If they are there, you can accept them or deny them. Youare Harry’s friend—and choosing to deny it would wound him terribly,perhaps beyond healing. But Miss Granger, what would drive you to suchextremes?”She couldn’t find words. She’d never been able to find words. “If youget too near Harry—you get swallowed up, and no one sees you any more,you’re just something of his, everyone thinks the whole world revolvesaround him and…” She didn’t have the words.The old wizard nodded slowly. “It is indeed an unjust world we live in,Miss Granger. All the world now knows that it is I who defeated Grindel* 1049 *wald, and fewer remember Elizabeth Beckett who died opening the wayso I could pass through. And yet she is remembered. Harry Potter is thehero of this play, Miss Granger; the world does revolve around him. Heis destined for great things; and I ween that in time the name of AlbusDumbledore will be remembered as Harry Potter’s mysterious old wizard, more than for anything else I have done. And perhaps the name ofHermione Granger will be remembered as his companion, if you proveworthy of it in your day. For this I tell you true: never will you find moreglory on your own, than in Harry Potter’s company.”Hermione shook her head rapidly. “But that’s not—” She’d knownshe wouldn’t be able to explain. “It’s not about glory, it’s about being—something that belongs to someone else!”“So you think you would rather be the hero?” The old wizard sighed.“Miss Granger, I have been a hero, and a leader; and I would have been athousand times happier if I could have belonged to someone like HarryPotter. Someone made of sterner stuff than I, to make the hard decisions,and yet worthy to lead me. I thought, once, that I knew such a man, butI was mistaken… Miss Granger, you have no idea at all how fortunate arethose like you, compared to heroes.”The hot burning feeling was creeping up her throat again, alongwith helplessness, she didn’t understand why Professor McGonagall hadbrought her here if the Headmaster wasn’t going to help, and from aglance at Professor McGonagall’s face, it looked like Professor McGonagall also wasn’t sure now that it had been a good idea.“I don’t want to be a hero,” said Hermione Granger, “I don’t want tobe a hero’s companion, I just want to be me.”(The thought came to her a few seconds later that maybe she did infact want to be a hero, but she decided not to change what she’d said.)“Ah,” said the old wizard. “That is a tall order, Miss Granger.” Dumbledore rose from his throne, stepped out behind his desk, and pointedto a symbol on the wall, so ubiquitous that Hermione’s eyes had glossedright over it; a faded shield on which was inscribed the heraldry of Hogwarts, the lion and snake, and badger and raven, and in Latin engravedwords whose point she’d never understood. Then, as she realized wherethat shield was, and how old it looked, it suddenly occurred to Hermionethat this might be the original—“A Hufflepuff would say,” said Dumbledore, tapping his finger on thefaded badger and making Hermione wince for the sacrilege (if it was theoriginal), “that people fail to become who they are meant to be, becausethey are too lazy to put in all the work involved. A Ravenclaw,” tappingthe raven, “would repeat those words that the wise know to be far olderthan Socrates, know thyself, and say that people fail to become who theyare meant to be, through ignorance and lack of thought. And SalazarSlytherin,” Dumbledore frowned as his finger tapped the faded snake,“why, he said that we become who we are meant to be by following ourdesires wherever they lead. Perhaps he would say that people fail to become themselves because they refuse to do what is necessary to achievetheir ambitions. But then one notes that nearly all of the Dark Wizards tocome out of Hogwarts have been Slytherins. Did they become what theywere meant to be? I think not.” Dumbledore’s finger tapped the lion, andthen he turned toward her. “Tell me, Miss Granger, what would a Gryffindor say? I do not need to ask whether the Sorting Hat offered you thatHouse.”It didn’t seem like a hard question. “A Gryffindor would say that people don’t become who they should be, because they’re afraid.”“Most people are afraid, Miss Granger,” said the old wizard. “They livetheir whole lives circumscribed by crippling fear that cuts off everythingthey might accomplish, everything they might become. Fear of sayingor doing the wrong thing, fear of losing their mere possessions, fear ofdeath, and above all the fear of what other people will think of them. Suchfear is a most terrible thing, Miss Granger, and it is terribly important toknow that. But it is not what Godric Gryffindor would have said. Peoplebecome who they are meant to be, Miss Granger, by doing what is right.”The old wizard’s voice was gentle. “So tell me, Miss Granger, what seemsto you like the right choice? For that is who you truly are, and whereverthat path leads, that is who you are meant to become.”There was a long space filled with the sounds of things that could notbe counted.She thought about it, because she was a Ravenclaw.“I don’t think it’s right,” Hermione said slowly, “for someone to have1051 *to live inside someone else’s shadow like that…”“Many things in the world are not right,” said the old wizard, “thequestion is what is right for you to do about them. Hermione Granger, Ishall be less subtle than is usual for a mysterious old wizard, and tell yououtright that you cannot imagine how badly things could go if the eventssurrounding Harry Potter turn to ill. His quest is a matter you would noteven dream of walking away from, if you knew.”“What quest?” said Hermione. Her voice was trembling, becauseit was very clear what answer the Headmaster was looking for and shedidn’t want to give it. “What happened to Harry back then, why wasFawkes on his shoulder?”“He grew up,” said the old wizard. His eyes blinked several times,beneath the half-moon glasses, and his face suddenly looked very lined.“You see, Miss Granger, people do not grow up because of time, peoplegrow up when they are placed in grownup situations. That is whathappened to Harry Potter that Saturday. He was told—you are not toshare this information with anyone, you understand—he was told thathe would have to fight someone. I cannot tell you who. I cannot tell youwhy. But that is what happened to him, and why he needs his friends.”There was a pause.“Bellatrix Black?” Hermione said. She couldn’t have been moreshocked if someone had plugged an electrical cord into her ear. “You’regoing to make Harry fight Bellatrix Black?”“No,” said the old wizard. “Not her. I cannot tell you who, or why.”She thought about it some more.“Is there any way I can keep up with Harry?” said Hermione. “I mean,I’m not saying it’s what I’ll do, but—if he needs friends then can we beequal friends? Can I be a hero too?”“Ah,” said the old wizard, and smiled. “Only you can decide that, MissGranger.”“But you’re not going to help me like you’re helping Harry.”The old wizard shook his head. “I have helped him little enough, MissGranger. And if you are asking me for a quest—” The old wizard smiledagain, rather wryly. “Miss Granger, you are in your first year of Hogwarts.Do not be too eager to grow up; there will be time enough for that later.”“I’m twelve. Harry’s eleven.”“Harry Potter is special,” said the old wizard. “As you know, MissGranger.” The blue eyes were suddenly piercing beneath the half-moonglasses, and she was reminded of the day of the Dementor when Dumbledore’s voice had said, inside her mind, that he knew about Harry’s darkside.Hermione put up her hand and touched Professor McGonagall’s hand,which had stayed strong on her shoulder this whole time, and Hermionesaid, she was surprised that her voice didn’t break, “I’d like to go, now,please.”“Of course,” said Professor McGonagall, and Hermione felt the handon her shoulder gently turning her around to face the oaken door.“Have you chosen your path yet, Hermione Granger?” said AlbusDumbledore’s voice from behind her, even as the door slowly creakedopen to reveal the Enchantment of the Endless Stair.She nodded.“And?”“I’ll,” she said, her voice stuck, “I’ll, I’ll—”She swallowed.“I’ll do—what’s right—”She didn’t say anything else, she couldn’t, and then the Endless Stairbegan revolving around her once again.Neither she nor Professor McGonagall spoke on the way down.When the Flowing Stone gargoyles stepped out of their way, and thetwo of them stepped out into the corridors of Hogwarts, Professor McGonagall finally spoke, and she said in a whisper, “I’m so terribly sorry, MissGranger. I did not think the Headmaster would say such things to you. Ithink he truly has forgotten what it is like to be a child.”Hermione glanced back up to her and saw that Professor McGonagalllooked like she was about to burst into tears… only not really, but therewas a tightness in her face that was like that.“If I want to be a hero too,” said Hermione, “if I’ve decided to be a herotoo, is there anything you can do to help?”Professor McGonagall rapidly shook her head, and said, “Miss Granger, I’m not sure the Headmaster is wrong about that. You are twelve.”“Okay,” said Hermione.They walked forward a bit.“Excuse me,” said Hermione, “is it okay if I walk back to the Ravenclawtower by myself? I’m sorry, it’s not your fault or anything, I just want tobe by myself right now.”“Of course, Miss Granger,” said Professor McGonagall, her voicesounding a little hoarse, and Hermione heard her footsteps stop, andthen turn around behind her.Hermione Granger walked away.She climbed a flight of stairs, and then another, wondering if therewas anyone else in Hogwarts who would give her a chance to be a hero.Professor Flitwick would say the same thing as Professor McGonagall,and even if he didn’t, he probably couldn’t help, Hermione didn’t knowwho could help. Well, Professor Quirrell would come up with somethingclever if she used up enough Quirrell points, but she had a feeling that asking him would be a bad idea—that the Defense Professor couldn’t helpanyone become the sort of hero that was worth becoming, and that hewouldn’t even understand the difference.She had almost gotten to the Ravenclaw tower when she saw the flashof gold.t was out of the corner of her eye that Hermione Granger saw it, a reflection on the polished metal of a statue at the junction of two corridors, a flash of gold, a flash of red, something like an image of fire; justfor a moment she saw it, and then it was gone.She paused, puzzled, and she almost walked away, but there had beensomething familiar about that brief glow—Hermione walked forward to where the statue had stood, looked atthe corridor from which she thought the fiery reflection might have come.Faintly, as though from a faraway place, she heard the cry, the call.Hermione started to run.She ran for a while; whenever she got to a junction she would pause,catch as much breath as she could, and then she would see a flash of firereflected from one direction or another, or hear that distant call. If ithadn’t been for her army training she would’ve fallen over in exhaustion,running like that.She never saw the phoenix.And then she came to a four-way branch and there was nothing, nosign, she waited for long seconds and she heard no cry and saw no fire,and she was only just starting to wonder with a sick sad feeling if she’dimagined the whole thing, when she heard a person cry out.When her rapidly racing feet turned the corner her mind took in thewhole scene at a glance, three huge boys in green-trimmed robes alreadyturning to look at her, and one shorter and smaller boy in yellow, who wasdangling in the air from one foot held up high by an invisible hand.The Sunshine General didn’t even think about it, people who stoppedto think didn’t spring very good ambushes.Her wand was in her hand, her fingers did the twist and her lips said“Somnium!” and the largest bully fell over, the Hufflepuff boy dropped outof the air with a thump and the other two bullies were trying to aim theirwands at her and she said “Somnium!” again and another huge boy keeledover—the one who’d been aiming his wand faster, that was who she’dfired at.Unfortunately casting two Sleep Hexes in a row like that was hardeven for her, and she couldn’t get off a third before—The last bully shouted “Protego!” and was surrounded by a shimmeringblue glow.Twenty-four hours ago, Hermione would have panicked at that, a realShielding Charm would let the bully-boy cast spells on her even while hewas protected.Now she—“Stupefy!” shouted the bully-boy.The crimson bolt blasted toward her with a terrible brilliance, blazingfar brighter than any hex that had sprung from Harry’s wand.Hermione swayed slightly to the left, and the bolt missed, because thebully’s aim hadn’t been nearly as good as Harry’s; and the thought cameto her that maybe bullies and Professor Quirrell’s armies didn’t mix.“Stupefy!” shouted the bully-boy again. “Expelliarmus! Stupefy!”Anyway, now she’d just spent a whole hour thinking of all the otherspells she could’ve cast on Harry and Neville—“Jellyfy!” yelled the bully-boy, a wide-beam jinx with no visible bolt tododge, and her knees suddenly felt almost too weak to support her. Andthen, with an angry roar producing an even brighter blaze of crimson,“Stupefy!”She dodged that one by deliberately falling, and by then she’d recovered enough for her next spell, which was—“Glisseo,” said Hermione, directing her remark to the floor.“Oof,” said the bully-boy as his feet went out from under him and heactually dropped his wand.The Protego winked out.“Somnium,” said Hermione.She was still breathing in gasps as she crawled over to where the Hufflepuff boy was sitting up, and groaning and rubbing his skull where he’dbeen dropped head-first into the floor; it was a good thing he hadn’t beena Muggle, Hermione realized, or he might have snapped his neck. Shehadn’t actually thought of that.“Uh,” said the boy, his hair was of a color that would’ve been called‘brunette’ if he was a girl, his eyes an undistinguished brown that somehow seemed just right for Hufflepuff, there weren’t any tears on his facebut he looked sort of pale. She pegged him at about fourth year, or third.Then the brown eyes widened as he focused on her. “General Sunshine?”“Yeah,” she said. “That’s (gasp) me.” If the Hufflepuff boy said anything about her being Harry Potter’s love interest, she decided, he wasgoing to die.“Wow,” said the Hufflepuff boy. “That was—you just—I mean I sawyou on the screens before Christmas but—wow! I can’t believe you justdid that!”There was a pause.I can’t believe I just did that, thought Hermione Granger, who was feeling a little faint all of a sudden, it must have been all that running. “Excuse (gasp) me,” she said, “can you (gasp) Unjellyfy my legs?”The boy nodded, pushed himself to his feet, and reached inside hisrobes for his wand; but Hermione had to correct his gesture before thecounter-Jinx worked right.“I’m Michael Hopkins,” said the boy once Hermione had rolled backto her own feet. He stuck out his hand. “Or just Mike inside Hufflepuff,there aren’t any other Mikes in all of Hufflepuff this year, would you believe it?”They shook hands, and Mike said, “Anyway, thank you.”Hermione wasn’t prepared for the rush of euphoria that hit her then,saving someone like that literally felt better than anything she’d ever feltin her whole life.She turned to look at the bullies.They were very big and they looked, she thought, around fifteen yearsold, and she was suddenly realizing just how large a difference had sprungup between Hogwarts students who’d signed up for all of Professor Quirrell’s extra-curricular activities, and students who’d had years of beingtaught by the worst Professors ever to go Professing. Being able to hitthings that you aimed at, for example; or being able to think well enoughin the middle of a fight to realize that you ought to Innervate your fallenallies. And other things Professor Quirrell had said, like that in the realworld almost any fight would be settled by a surprise attack, suddenlymade a lot more sense to her.Still trying to catch her breath, she looked back at Mike.“Would you (gasp) believe,” said Hermione Granger, “that five minutes ago I was (gasp) having trouble figuring out how to become a (gasp)hero?”Had she really thought she needed permission from someone, or thatheroes sat around waiting for someone else to give them quests? It wasvery simple actually, you just went where the evil was, that was all it evertook to be a hero. She should’ve remembered, she shouldn’t have neededa phoenix to tell her, that bad things sometimes happened right here inHogwarts.Then Hermione glanced nervously back at where the three older boyswere lying unconscious as the realization hit that they’d seen her, theymight know who she was, they might sneak up on her and take her by surprise and—and they could really hurt her—Hermione stopped.She remembered that Harry Potter had put himself in the middle offive Slytherin bullies on the first day of class when he hadn’t even knownhow to use his wand.She remembered the Headmaster saying that you grew up by beingput in grownup situations, and that most people lived their lives inside aconstraining circle of fear.And she remembered Professor McGonagall’s voice saying, ‘You aretwelve.’Hermione took a deep breath, once, twice, and three times.She asked Mike if he needed to go to Madam Pomfrey’s office, whichhe didn’t; and got him to tell her the names of the Slytherin boys, just incase.And then Hermione Granger strolled away from the heap of unconscious bullies, making sure to put a smile on her face as she walked.She knew that she was probably going to get hurt sooner or later. Butif you were too scared of getting hurt to do what was right, then youcouldn’t be a hero, it was as simple as that; and if you’d put the SortingHat on her head at that moment it wouldn’t have waited even one secondbefore calling out ‘GRYFFINDOR!’She was still thinking about it when she came down to dinner; the euphoria of saving someone still hadn’t worn off, and she was beginning toworry that it had broken something in her brain.As she approached the Ravenclaw table a sudden epidemic of whispers broke out, and Hermione wondered if the Hufflepuff boy had saidanything yet before she realized that the whispers probably weren’t aboutthat.She sat down across from Harry Potter who looked extremely nervous,probably because she was still smiling.“Uh—” said Harry, as she served herself freshly toasted bread, butter, cinnamon, no fruits or vegetables whatsoever, and three helpings ofchocolate brownies. “Uh—”She let him go on like that until she’d finished pouring herself a glassof grapefruit juice, and then she said, “I’ve got a question for you, Mr. Potter. How do you think people fail to become themselves?”“What?” said Harry.She looked at him. “Pretend there isn’t all this stuff going on,” shesaid, “and just say whatever you’d have said yesterday.”“Um…” Harry said, looking very confused and worried. “I think we already are ourselves… it’s not like I’m an imperfect copy of someone else.But I guess if I try to run with the sense of the question, then I’d say thatpeople don’t become themselves because we absorb all this crazy stufffrom the environment and then regurgitate it. I mean, how many peopleplaying Quidditch would be playing a game like that if they’d inventedthe game themselves? Or back in Muggle Britain, how many people whothink of themselves as Labour or Conservative or Liberal Democrat wouldinvent that exact bundle of political beliefs if they had to come up with everything themselves?”Hermione considered this. She’d been wondering if Harry would saysomething Slytherin or maybe even Gryffindor, but this didn’t seem to fitinto the Headmaster’s list; and it occurred to Hermione that there mightbe a lot more viewpoints on the subject than just four.“Okay,” said Hermione, “different question. What makes someone ahero?”“A hero?” said Harry.“Yeah,” said Hermione.“Ah…” Harry said. His fork and knife nervously sawed at a piece ofsteak, cutting it into tinier and tinier pieces. “I think a lot of people cando things when the world channels them into it… like people are expecting you to do it, or it only uses skills you already know, or there’s an authority watching to catch your mistakes and make sure you do your part.But problems like that are probably already being solved, you know, andthen there’s no need for heroes. So I think the people we call ‘heroes’are rare because they’ve got to make everything up as they go along, andmost people aren’t comfortable with that. Why do you ask?” Harry’s forkstabbed three pieces of thoroughly shredded steak and lifted them up tohis mouth.“Oh, I just stunned three older Slytherin bullies and rescued a Hufflepuff,” said Hermione. “I’m going to be a hero.”When Harry had finished choking on his food (some of the otherRavenclaws in hearing distance were still coughing) he said, “What?”Hermione told the story, it began rippling out in further whisperseven as she spoke. (Though she left out the part about the phoenix, because that seemed like a private thing between the two of them. Hermione had felt surprised, thinking about it afterward, that a phoenix wouldappear for someone who wanted to be a hero; it seemed a bit selfish whenshe thought about it that way; but maybe it didn’t matter to phoenixes solong as they saw that you were willing to help people.)When she was done talking, Harry stared at her across the table anddidn’t say a word.“I’m sorry for how I acted earlier,” Hermione said. She sipped fromher glass of grapefruit juice. “I should’ve remembered that if I’m still beating the pants off you in Charms class then it’s okay for you to do better inDefense.”“Please don’t take this the wrong way,” said Harry. He looked too-adultnow, and grim. “But are you sure this is who you are, and not, to put itbluntly, me?”“I’m quite certain,” said Hermione. “Why, my name practically spellsout ‘heroine’ except for the extra ‘m’, I never noticed that until today.”“Being a hero isn’t all fun and games,” said Harry. “Not real heroing,the sort grownups have to do, it isn’t like this, it isn’t going to be this easy.”“I know,” said Hermione.“It’s hard and it’s painful and you’ve got to make decisions where thereisn’t any good answer—”“Yes, Harry, I read those books too.”“No,” said Harry, “you don’t understand, even if the books warn youthere’s no way you can understand until—”“That doesn’t stop you,” said Hermione. “It doesn’t stop you even alittle. I bet you never even considered not being a hero because of that. Sowhy d’you think it’ll stop me?”There was a pause.A sudden huge smile lit Harry’s face, a smile that was as bright andas boyish as the frown had been grim and adult, and everything was allright again between them.“This is going to go horribly mind-bogglingly wrong somehow,” saidHarry, still smiling hugely. “You know that, right?”“Oh, I know,” said Hermione. She ate another bite of toast. “That reminds me, Dumbledore refused to be my mysterious old wizard, is theresomeplace I can write to get another one?”1061 *Aftermath:“…and Professor Flitwick says her determination seems unshakeable,”Minerva said tightly, staring at the silver-bearded old wizard who was responsible for this. Albus Dumbledore was just sitting silently and listening to her with a distant sad look in his eyes. “Miss Granger didn’t evenblink when Professor Flitwick threatened to have her transferred to Gryffindor, just said that if she left she would take all the books with her. Hermione Granger has decided she’s going to be a hero and she’s not takingno for an answer. I doubt you could have pushed her into this any harderif you had tried to—”It took all of five full seconds for Minerva’s brain to process the realization.“ALBUS!” she shrieked.“My dear,” said the old wizard, “after you have dealt with your thirtieth hero or so, you will realize that they react quite predictably to certainthings; such as being told that they are too young, or that they are notdestined to be heroes, or that being a hero is unpleasant; and if you trulywish to be sure you should tell them all three. Although,” with a brief sigh,“it does not do to be too blatant, or your Deputy Headmistress might catchyou.”“Albus,” Minerva said, her voice even tighter, “if she is hurt, I swearthis time I’ll—”“She would have come to that same place in due time,” Albus said, thedistant sad look still in his eyes. “If someone is meant to become a herothen they will not listen to our warnings, Minerva, no matter how hardwe try. And given that, it is better for Harry if Miss Granger does notfall too far behind him.” Albus produced, as though from nowhere, a tinwhich flipped open to reveal small yellow lumps, she’d never been able tofigure out where he kept it and she’d never been able to detect the magicinvolved. “Lemon drop?”“She is a twelve-year-old girl, Albus!”Afteraftermath:Within the windows, barely visible in the evening gloom, fishes swamin the black waters; illuminated by the bright shine of the Slytherin common room as they came closer, fading into darkness as they swam away.Daphne Greengrass was sitting in a comfortable black leather couch,her head collapsed into her hands, glowing golden-yellowish as brightsparks of white light winked in and out of existence around her.She’d been ready to be teased about liking Neville Longbottom. She’dbeen expecting to hear a lot of snide remarks about Hufflepuffs. She’dthought of whole reams of snappy comebacks for it while she was on theway back to the Slytherin dungeons.She’d been looking forward to being teased about liking Neville. Beingteased about that sort of thing meant you’d grown up into a real girl.As it turned out, nobody had worked out that her challenging Nevilleto a Most Ancient Duel meant that she liked him. She’d thought it wouldbe obvious but no, nobody else had even thought of that apparently.It was always the hex you didn’t see that hit you.She should’ve just called herself Daphne of Sunshine, like Neville ofChaos. Or Sunny Daphne like Sunny Ron. Or anything except Greengrassof Sunshine.Greengrass of Sunshine.It had gone from there to Greengrass of Sunshine and Blue Skies.Then someone had added Snow-Topped Mountains and FrolickingWoodland Creatures.Currently she was being referred to as the Sparkly Unicorn Princessof the Noble and Most Ancient House of Sparklypoo.And some cursed sixth-year girl had hit her with a Sparkling Jinx, shehadn’t even known there was such a thing as a Sparkling Jinx, and FiniteIncantatem hadn’t worked, and she’d asked older girls who she’d thoughtwere her friends (she had apparently been wrong about this) and thenshe’d threatened the caster with grievous political mayhem wreaked byher father and nonetheless Daphne Greengrass was still sitting in theSlytherin common room with her head in her hands, sparkling brightlyand wondering how she’d ended up as the only sane person in Hogwarts.It was after dinnertime and they were still at it and if they didn’t stop bytomorrow morning she was going to transfer to Durmstrang and becomethe next Dark Lady.“Hey, everyone!” said the Carrow twins dramatically, waving an issueof the Daily Prophet. “Did you hear the news? The Wizengamot just ruledthat ‘let’s see what you got’ constitutes a lawful challenge to be foughtuntil the challenger lies down and has a nap!”“How dare you insult the honor of the Sparkly Unicorn Princess!”shouted Tracey. “Let’s see what you got!” Then Tracey lay down flat onher sofa and started snoring loudly.Daphne’s sparkling head sank further into her glowing hands. “Aftermy family takes over I’m going to have you all put under anti-Apparitionjinxes and Flooed into the sea,” she said to no one in particular. “You’reall okay with that, right?”Thunk-thunk, thunk-thunk-thunk, thunk.Daphne looked up, surprised; that was a Sunshine code-signal—“I hight someone knocking!” bellowed Mr. Goyle. “Knocking of the door!”“Let’s see what you’ve got, door!” shouted an older boy near the door, andyanked the door open.There was a moment of complete surprise.“I’ve come to have a word with Miss Greengrass,” said the SunshineGeneral, sounding like she was trying to sound confident. “Could someone please—”From the look on Hermione’s face she had just noticed Daphnesparkling.And that was when Millicent Bulstrode raced up from the lower dormsand shouted, “Hey, everyone, guess what, now Granger went and beat upDerrick and what’s left of his crew, and his father owled him and said thatif he didn’t—”Millicent caught sight of Hermione standing in the doorway.There was a very loud silence.“Uh,” said Daphne. What? said her brain. “Uh, what’re you doing here,General?”“Well,” said Hermione Granger with a strange smile on her face, “I’vedecided it’s not fair if mysterious old wizards give some people a chanceto be heroes and not others, and also I’ve read history books and therearen’t nearly enough girl heroes in them. So I thought I’d just drop byand see if you wanted to be a hero and why are you glowing like that?”There was another silence.“This,” said Daphne, “was probably not the best time to ask me thatquestion—”“I’ll take it!” shouted Tracey Davis, leaping off her sofa.And thus was born the Society for the Promotion of Heroic Equality forWitches.ven if you had been the Deputy Headmistress for three decades, and aTransfiguration Professor before that, it was rare that you saw AlbusDumbledore caught completely flatfooted.“…Susan Bones, Lavender Brown, and Daphne Greengrass,” Minervafinished. “I should also note, Albus, that Miss Granger’s account of yourseemingly unsupportive attitude—I believe her phrase was ‘he said Ishould be happy to be just a sidekick’—has generated a good deal ofinterest among the older girls. Several of whom came to me to ask if MissGranger’s accusations were true, since Miss Granger had said that I wasthere.”The old wizard leaned back in his huge chair, still gazing at her, hiseyes looking rather abstracted beneath the half-moon glasses.“It placed me in something of a dilemma, Albus,” said Professor McGonagall. Her face stayed quite neutral, she made sure of that. “I now knowthat you did not truly mean to discourage the girl. Quite the opposite,in fact. But you and Severus have often told me that to keep a secret Imust give no sign that differs from the reaction of someone truly ignorant. Thus I had no choice but to confirm that Miss Granger’s accountwas accurate, and feign the appropriate degree of worry, with a slightovertone of offense. After all, had I not known you were deliberately manipulating Miss Granger, I might have been rather put out.”“I… see,” the old wizard said slowly. His hands toyed absently with hissilver beard, small quick gestures.“Thankfully,” Professor McGonagall continued, “so far Professors Sinistra and Vector are the only two faculty members to don Miss Granger’sbuttons.”“Buttons?” repeated the old wizard.Minerva drew forth a small silver disc bearing the initials sphew, laidit on Albus’s desk, and gave it a brief tap with her finger.And the voices of Hermione Granger, Padma Patil, Parvati Patil,Lavender Brown, Susan Bones, Hannah Abbott, Daphne Greengrass,and Tracey Davis cried out in unison, “We won’t settle for second best, it’stime to give a witch a quest!”“Miss Granger is selling them for two Sickles, and tells me that shehas so far sold fifty of them. I believe that Nymphadora Tonks, in seventhyear Hufflepuff, is enchanting them for her. To conclude my report,” Professor McGonagall said briskly, “our eight newly minted heroines haveasked permission to conduct a protest outside the entrance to your office.”“I hope,” Albus said, frowning, “you explained to them that—”“I explained to them that Wednesday at 7pm would be fine,” said Minerva. She took back the button from the Headmaster’s desk, favored Albus with a honeyed smile, and turned to the door.“Minerva?” said the old wizard from behind her. “Minerva!”The oaken door shut solidly behind her.There wasn’t a lot of room between the brief stone walls that demarcatedthe vestibule to the Headmaster’s office, so although a lot of people hadwanted to watch the protest, not many had been allowed to come. JustProfessor Sinistra and Professor Vector, who were wearing the buttons,and the prefects Penelope Clearwater and Rose Brown and JacquelinePreece, who were wearing the buttons. Behind them, Professor McGonagall and Professor Sprout and Professor Flitwick, who weren’t wearingthe buttons, scrutinizing the whole affair. Harry Potter and the Head Boyof Hogwarts were there, and the boy prefects Percy Weasley and OliverBeatson, all wearing the buttons to show Solidarity. And of course theeight founding members of sphew, forming a picket line next to the gargoyles with their signs. Hermione’s own sign, attached to a solid woodenhandle which seemed to weigh heavier and heavier in her hands as theseconds passed, said NOBODY’S SIDEKICK.And Professor Quirrell, who was leaning with his back against the farstone wall and watching with unreadable eyes. The Defense Professorhad gotten one of her buttons, though she’d never sold one to him; andhe wasn’t wearing it, but idly tossing it with one hand.This whole idea had seemed like a much better idea four days ago,when the fires of her indignation had been burning fresh and hot, andshe’d been facing the prospect of doing it all four days later instead ofright now.But she had to carry on, because that was what heroes did, they carried on, and also because it had seemed infinitely too awful to tell everyone she was calling it off. Hermione wondered how much heroism hadgone on for reasons like that. Most books didn’t say “And then they refused to give up, no matter how sensible it would have been, because thatwould’ve been too embarrassing”; but a great deal of history made a lotmore sense that way.At 7:15pm, Professor McGonagall had told her, Headmaster Dumbledore would come down and talk to them for a couple of minutes. Professor McGonagall had said not to be frightened—the Headmaster wasa good person deep down, and they’d properly gotten the school’s authorization for the protest.But Hermione was very very aware that even if she was doing it withsigned permission, she was still Defying Authority.After she’d decided to be a hero, Hermione had done the obviousthing, and gone to the Hogwarts library and taken out books on howto be a hero. Then she’d returned those books back to their shelves, because it’d been patently obvious that none of the authors had been actualheroes themselves. Instead she’d just read five times over, until she’dmemorized every word, the thirty inches by Godric Gryffindor that wasall his autobiography and his life’s advice. (Or the English translation,anyway; she couldn’t read Latin yet.) Godric Gryffindor’s autobiographyhad been a lot more compressed than the books Hermione was used toreading, he used one sentence to say things that should’ve taken thirtyinches just by themselves, and then there was another sentence afterthat…But it was clear from what she’d read that, while Defying Authoritywasn’t the point of being a hero, you couldn’t be a hero if you were tooscared to do it. And Hermione Granger knew by now how others saw her,and she knew what other people thought she couldn’t do.Hermione hefted her picket sign a little higher and concentrated onbreathing slowly and rhythmically instead of hyperventilating until shefell over.“Really?” said Miss Preece in a tone of undisguised fascination. “Theycouldn’t vote?”“Indeed,” said Professor Sinistra. (The Astronomy Professor’s hairwas still dark, and her dark face only slightly lined; Hermione wouldhave guessed her age at around seventy, except—) “I quite remember mymother’s rejoicing when they announced the Qualification of WomenAct, although she did not actually qualify.” (Which meant that ProfessorSinistra had been around her Muggle family in 1918.) “And that wasn’tthe worst of it. Why, just a few centuries earlier—”Thirty seconds later all the non-Muggleborns, male and female both,were staring at Professor Sinistra with utterly shocked expressions. Hannah had dropped her sign.“And that wasn’t the worst of it either, not by half,” finished ProfessorSinistra. “But you see where this sort of thing could potentially lead.”“Merlin preserve us,” said Penelope Clearwater in a strangled voice.“You mean that’s how men would treat us if we didn’t have wands to defend ourselves?”“Hey!” said one of the boy prefects. “That’s not—”There was a short, sardonic laugh from the direction of ProfessorQuirrell. When Hermione turned her head to look she saw that theDefense Professor was still idly toying with the button, not bothering toglance up at the rest of them, as he said, “Such is human nature, MissClearwater. Rest assured that you would be no kinder, if witches hadwands and men lacked them.”“I hardly think so!” snapped Professor Sinistra.A cold chuckle. “I suspect it happens more often than any dare suggest, in the proudest pureblood families. Some lonely witch spies a handsome Muggle; and thinks how very easy it would be, to slip the man a lovepotion, and by him be adored alone and utterly. And since she knows hecan offer her no resistance, why, it is only natural for her to take from himwhatever she pleases—”“Professor Quirrell!” said Professor McGonagall sharply.“I’m sorry,” Professor Quirrell said mildly, his eyes still looking downon the button in his hand, “are we all still pretending it doesn’t happen?My apologies, then.”Professor Sinistra snapped, “And I suppose that wizards don’t—”“There are children present, Professors!” Again Professor McGonagall.“Some do,” Professor Quirrell said equably, as though discussing theweather. “Although personally, I don’t.”There was a bit of silence, for a time. Hermione put up her signagain—it had slipped down to her shoulder while she was listening.She’d never thought of that, not even a little, and now she was trying notto think of it, and her stomach was feeling a bit queasy. She looked inHarry Potter’s direction, not quite knowing why she did; and she sawthat Harry’s face was perfectly still. A chill ran down her spine before shelooked away, not quite fast enough to miss the small nod that Harry gaveher, as though they were agreeing on something.“To be fair,” Professor Sinistra said after a while, “since I received myHogwarts letter I can’t recall encountering any prejudice on account ofbeing a woman, or colored. No, now it is all for being a Muggleborn. Ibelieve Miss Granger said that it was just with heroes that she found aproblem, so far?”It took Hermione a moment to recognize that she’d been asked thequestion, and then she said “Yes,” in a tone that squeaked a little. Thiswhole thing had blown up a bit larger than she’d imagined when she’dstarted it.“What exactly did you check, Miss Granger?” said Professor Vector.She looked older than Professor Sinistra, her hair starting to gray a little;1071 *Hermione hadn’t ever come close to Professor Vector in person until theArithmancy Professor had asked her for a button.“Um,” Hermione said, her voice a little high, “I checked the historybooks and there’s been as many woman Ministers of Magic as men. ThenI looked at Supreme Mugwumps and there were a few more wizards thanwitches but not many. But if you look at people like famous Dark Wizardhunters, or people who’ve stopped invasions of Dark creatures, or peoplewho’ve overthrown Dark Lords—”“And the Dark Wizards themselves, of course,” said Professor Quirrell.Now the Defense Professor had looked up. “You may add that to your list,Miss Granger. Among all the suspected Death Eaters we know of only twosorceresses, Bellatrix Black and Alecto Carrow. And I daresay that mostwizards would be hard-pressed to name a single Dark Lady besides BabaYaga.”Hermione just stared at him.He couldn’t possibly be—“Professor Quirrell,” said Professor Vector, “what exactly are you implying?”The Defense Professor raised the button so that the golden-letteredsphew faced them, and said, “Heroes,” then turned the button to showits silver backside and said, “Dark Wizards. They are similar career pathsfollowed by similar people, and one can hardly ask why young witches areturning away from one course without considering its reflection.”“Oh, now I see!” said Tracey Davis, speaking up so suddenly that Hermione gave a small startle. “You’re joining our protest because you’re worried that not enough girls are becoming Dark Witches!” Then Tracey giggled, which Hermione couldn’t have managed at this point if you paid hera million pounds sterling.There was a half-smile on Professor Quirrell’s face as he replied, “Notreally, Miss Davis. In truth I do not care about that sort of thing in theslightest. But it is futile to count the witches among Ministers of Magicand other such ordinary folk leading ordinary existences, when Grindelwald and Dumbledore and He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named were all men.”The Defense Professor’s fingers idly spun the button, turning it over andover. “Then again, only a very few folk ever do anything interesting withtheir lives. What does it matter to you if they are mostly witches or mostlywizards, so long as you are not among them? And I suspect you will notbe among them, Miss Davis; for although you are ambitious, you have noambition.”“That’s not true!” said Tracey indignantly. “And what’s it mean?”Professor Quirrell straightened from where he had been leaningagainst the wall. “You were Sorted into Slytherin, Miss Davis, and Iexpect that you will grasp at any opportunity for advancement whichfalls into your hands. But there is no great ambition that you are drivento accomplish, and you will not make your opportunities. At best youwill grasp your way upward into Minister of Magic, or some other highposition of unimportance, never breaking the bounds of your existence.”Then Professor Quirrell’s gaze shifted away from Tracey, he was looking at her, the pale blue eyes staring at her with an awful intensity— “Tellme, Miss Granger. Do you have an ambition?”“Professor—” squeaked the high stern voice of Professor Flitwick, andthen her Head of House’s voice cut off, and from the side of her vision Hermione saw that Harry had laid his hand on Professor Flitwick’s shoulderand was shaking his head, face looking very adult.Hermione felt like a deer caught in headlights.“What drove you to break your bounds, Miss Granger?” said the Defense Professor, still gazing directly at her. “Why is getting good marksin class no longer enough? Is it true greatness that you seek? Does someaspect of the world dissatisfy you, that you must remake according toyour will? Or is this all merely a child’s game to you? I will be quite disappointed if this is only about rivaling Harry Potter.”“I—” said Hermione, her voice so high-pitched it made a sort of peeping sound, but then she couldn’t think of what else to say.“You may take a moment to think, if you like,” said Professor Quirrell.“Pretend it is a homework essay, six inches due Thursday. I hear you arequite eloquent in them.”Everyone was looking at her.“I—” said Hermione. “I don’t agree with one single thing you just said,anywhere.”“Well spoken,” came Professor McGonagall’s crisp voice.Professor Quirrell’s gaze did not waver. “That is not six inches, MissGranger. Something drives you to defy the Headmaster’s verdict andgather followers about yourself. Perhaps it is something you prefer notto speak aloud?”Hermione knew the correct answer wouldn’t impress Professor Quirrell, but it was the correct answer, so she said it. “I don’t think you needambition to be a hero,” Hermione said. Her voice wavered but it didn’tcrack. “I think you just have to do what’s right. And they’re not my followers, we’re friends.”Professor Quirrell leaned back against the wall again. The half-smilehad faded from his face. “Most folk tell themselves they are doing right,Miss Granger. They do not thereby rise above the ordinary.”Hermione took a couple of deep breaths, trying to be brave. “It’s notabout being not ordinary,” she said as stoutly as she could. “But I thinkif someone just tries to do what’s right, over and over again, and they’renot too lazy to do all the work it takes, and they think about what they’redoing, and they’re brave enough to do it even when they’re scared—” Hermione paused for an instant, her eyes darting to Tracey and Daphne, “—and they cleverly plan how to do it—and they don’t just do what otherpeople do—then I think someone like that would already get into enoughtrouble.”Some of the girls and boys chuckled, as did Professor McGonagall,who looked wry and proud at the same time.“You may be right about that,” said the Defense Professor, his eyeshalf-lidded. He tossed Hermione the button, and she caught it withoutthinking. “My donation to your cause, Miss Granger. I understand thatthey are worth two Sickles.”The Defense Professor turned and walked away without anotherword.“I thought I was going to faint!” gasped Hannah after his footstepshad faded, and she heard some of the other girls letting out their breathor putting down their signs for a moment.“I do too have an ambition!” said Tracey, who seemed to be almost onthe verge of tears. “I‘m—I’m—I’ll figure out what it is by tomorrow, but Ihave one, I’m sure!”“If you really can’t think of anything,” Daphne said, giving Tracey acomforting pat on the shoulder, “just go with the oldie but goodie and tryto take over the world.”“Hey!” said Susan sharply. “You’re supposed to be heroes now! Thatmeans you have to be good!”“No, it’s all right,” said Lavender, “I’m pretty sure General Chaoswants to take over the world and he’s sort of a good guy.”More conversation was going on behind the picket line. “My goodness,” said Penelope Clearwater. “I think that’s the most overtly evil Defense Professor we’ve ever had.”Professor McGonagall coughed warningly, and the Head Boy said,“You weren’t around for Professor Barney,” which made several peopletwitch.“Professor Quirrell just talks like that,” said Harry Potter, though hesounded less certain than before. “I mean, think about it, he doesn’t doanything like what Professor Snape does—”“Mr. Potter,” squeaked Professor Flitwick, voice polite and face stern,“why did you ask me to stay silent?”“Professor Quirrell was testing Hermione to see if he wanted to beher mysterious old wizard,” Harry said. “Which totally would not haveworked out in any way, shape, or form, but she had to answer for herself.”Hermione blinked.Then Hermione blinked again, as she realized that it was ProfessorQuirrell who was Harry Potter’s mysterious old wizard, and not Dumbledore at all, and that really wasn’t a good sign—A rumbling noise filled the small stone vestibule, and Hermione, hernerves already on edge, spun rapidly around, almost dropping her protestsign as her other hand darted toward her wand.The gargoyles were stepping aside, the Flowing Stone rumbling likerock as it moved like flesh. The huge ugly figures waited only briefly, deadgray eyes staring out in silent vigil. Then the great gargoyles folded theirwings back into place and stepped back into their former positions, theFlowing Stone not changing its outward appearance at all as it returnedfrom flexibility to motionlessness, and the brief gap in the stone of Hogwarts was solid once more.And before them all, wearing robes of bright purple that probablyonly looked hideous if you were Muggleborn, stood the towering form ofAlbus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, the Headmaster of Hogwarts,the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, the Supreme Mugwump of theInternational Confederation of Wizards, the vanquisher of the DarkLord Grindelwald and protector of Britain, the rediscoverer of the fabledTwelve Uses of Dragon’s Blood, the most powerful wizard alive; andhe was looking at her, Hermione Jean Granger, General of the recentlyexpanded Sunshine Regiment, who was getting the best grades in thefirst year of Hogwarts classes, and who had declared herself a heroine.Even her name was shorter than his.The Headmaster smiled benevolently at her, his wrinkle-lined eyestwinkling cheerfully beneath their half-circles of glass, and said, “Hello,Miss Granger.”The odd thing was that it wasn’t nearly as scary as talking to ProfessorQuirrell. “Hello, Headmaster Dumbledore,” Hermione said with only aslight quaver in her voice.“Miss Granger,” said Dumbledore, now looking more serious, “I thinkyou and I may have had a bit of a misunderstanding. I did not mean to imply that you could not, or should not be a hero. I certainly did not mean toimply that witches in general should not be heroes. Only that you were…a bit young, to be thinking of such things.”Hermione, unable to help herself, glanced at Professor McGonagalland saw that Professor McGonagall was giving her an encouragingsmile—or she was giving the two of them some kind of smile, anyway—soHermione looked back at the Headmaster and said, the small quaver inher voice a little larger now, “Since you became Headmaster forty yearsago, there’ve been eleven students to graduate Hogwarts who becameheroes, I mean people like Lupe Cazaril and so on, and ten of those wereboys. Cimorene Linderwall was the only witch.”“Hm,” said the Headmaster. There was a thoughtful expression onhis face; he at least seemed to be thinking about it. “Miss Granger, I havenever been one for tallying such numbers. Often it is too much easierto count than to understand. Many good people have come out of Hogwarts, witches and wizards both; those famed as heroes are only one kindof good person, and perhaps not the highest. You did not include AliceLongbottom or Lily Potter in your reckoning… But leave that aside. Tellme, Miss Granger, did you tally how many heroes came out of Hogwartsin the forty years before me? For in that time I can recall only three nowcalled heroes; and among those three, no witches at all.”“I’m not trying to say it’s just you!” Hermione said. “Only I thinkmaybe a lot of people, like the Headmasters before you too, maybe evenyour whole society and everything, might be discouraging girls.”The old wizard sighed. His half-glasses eyes looked only at her, asthough they were the only two people present. “Miss Granger, it mightbe possible to discourage witches from becoming Charms Mistresses, orQuidditch players, or even Aurors. But not heroes. If someone is meantto be a hero then a hero they will be. They will walk through fire and swimthrough ice. Dementors will not stop them, nor the deaths of friends, andnot discouragement either.”“Well,” Hermione said, and paused, struggling with the words. “Well,I mean… what if that’s not actually true? I mean, to me it seems that if youwant more witches to be heroes, you ought to teach them heroing.”“Many boys and girls are heroes in their dreams,” Dumbledore saidquietly. He did not look at any of the other girls, only at her. “Fewer inthe waking world. Many have stood their ground and faced the darknesswhen it comes for them. Fewer come for the darkness and force it to facethem. It is a hard life, sometimes lonely, often short. I have told none torefuse that calling, but neither would I wish to increase their number.”Hermione hesitated; there was something in the lined face thatstopped her, like a hint to all the emotion that wasn’t being displayed,years and years of it…Maybe if there were more heroes, their lives wouldn’t be so lonely, or so short.She couldn’t bring herself to say that, though, not to him.“But the point is moot,” said the old wizard. He smiled, a bit ruefullyshe thought. “Miss Granger, you cannot teach heroism like you wouldteach Charms. You cannot assign twelve inches on how to carry on whenall hope seems lost. You cannot rehearse students on when to stand upand tell the Headmaster he has done wrong. Heroes are born, not taught.And for whatever reason, more of them are born boys than girls.” TheHeadmaster shrugged, as if to say that he was helpless to do anythingabout that.“Um,” Hermione said. She couldn’t help it, she glanced behind her.Professor Sinistra was looking a bit indignant. And it wasn’t true thateveryone was staring at her like she’d just been silly, the way she’d startedto imagine while she was listening to Dumbledore.Hermione turned back to face Dumbledore again, took a deep breath,and said, “Well, maybe people who are going to be heroes, will be heroesno matter what. But I don’t see how anyone could really know that, asidefrom just saying it afterward. And when I told you that I wanted to be ahero, you weren’t very encouraging.”“Mr. Potter,” the Headmaster said mildly. His eyes didn’t leave hers.“Please tell Miss Granger your impression of our own first meeting.Would you say that I was encouraging? Speak the truth.”There was a pause.“Mr. Potter?” said Professor Vector’s voice from behind her, soundingpuzzled.“Um,” Harry’s voice said from further back, sounding extremely reluctant. “Um… well, actually in my case the Headmaster set fire to a chicken.”“He what?” Hermione blurted, only there were several other people exclaiming things at around the same time so she wasn’t sure anyone heardher.Dumbledore went on gazing at her, looking perfectly serious.“I didn’t know about Fawkes,” Harry’s voice said rapidly, “so he toldme that Fawkes was a phoenix, while he was pointing to a chicken onFawkes’s stand so I’d think that was Fawkes, and then he set the chickenon fire—and also he gave me this big rock and told me it had belonged tomy father and I ought to carry it everywhere—”“But that’s crazy!” Susan blurted out.There was a sudden hush.The Headmaster slowly turned his head to stare at Susan.“I—” said Susan. “I mean—I—”The Headmaster leaned down until he was face-to-face with theyoung girl.“I didn’t—” said Susan.Dumbledore put a finger to his lips and twiddled them, making abweeble-bweeble-bweeble sound.The Headmaster straightened up again and said, “Well, my good heroines, it has been pleasant speaking to you, but alas, much else remains todo this day. Still, rest assured that I am inscrutable at everyone, not justwitches.”The gargoyles stepped aside, the Flowing Stone rumbling like rock asit moved like flesh.The huge ugly figures waited briefly with dead gray eyes staring outin silent vigil, as Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, smiling asbenevolently as when he’d first emerged from his office, stepped backinto the Enchantment of the Endless Stair.Then the great gargoyles folded their wings back into place andstepped back into their former positions, only one last brief “Bwa-ha-ha!”echoing out before the gap closed.There was a long silence.“He really set a chicken on fire?” said Hannah.The eight of them had continued protesting even after that, but to be honest their heart had gone out of it.It had been established, after some careful questions from ProfessorFlitwick, that Harry Potter hadn’t smelled the chicken burning. Whichmeant that it had probably been a pebble or something, Transfigured intoa chicken and then enclosed in a Boundary Charm to make sure that nosmoke escaped into the air—both Professor Flitwick and Professor McGonagall had been very emphatic about nobody trying that without theirsupervision.But still…But still… what?Hermione didn’t even know but still what.But still.After a lot of glances exchanged between girls none of whom hadwanted to be first to say it, Hermione had declared the protest over, andthe adults and boys had drifted off.“You don’t think we were being unfair to Dumbledore, do you?” saidSusan as the heroines walked away to the sound of eight pairs of feet trodding on the stone paving of Hogwarts’s corridors. “I mean, if he is crazyat everyone and not just at witches then it’s not discrimination, right?”“I don’t want to protest against the Headmaster any more,” Hannahsaid weakly. The Hufflepuff girl seemed a bit unsteady on her feet. “Idon’t care what Professor McGonagall says about him not holding itagainst us, it’s just too much for my nerves.”Lavender snorted. “I guess you won’t be slaying armies of Inferi anytime soon—”“Stop that!” Hermione said sharply. “Look, all of us have got to learnto be heroines, right? It’s okay if someone doesn’t know right away.”“The Headmaster doesn’t think it can be learned,” Padma said. TheRavenclaw girl’s face was thoughtful, her steps measured as she strodethrough the corridor. “The Headmaster doesn’t even think that’s a goodidea.”Daphne was striding with her back straight and her head held boltupright, looking more like a Proper Young Lady in her Hogwarts robesthan Hermione could have done with her best formal dress. “The Headmaster,” Daphne said in a precise voice, her shoes making hard, sharptacking sounds on the stone, “thinks the lot of us are a bunch of silly girlsplaying games, and that someday Hermione might make a good sidekickbut the rest of us are hopeless.”“Is he right?” said Parvati. The Gryffindor girl’s face was very serious,making her look much more like her twin than she usually did. “I meanit has to be asked—”“No!” spat Tracey. The Slytherin girl was stalking through the hallway looking ready to kill someone, like a miniature female Snape. Of allthe girls, Tracey was the one who Hermione knew least. Hermione hadtalked to Lavender once before, but she’d never really seen Tracey exceptat wandpoint during a battle, until the Slytherin had jumped up from hersofa to volunteer. “We’ll show him! We’ll show them all!”“Okay,” said Susan, “that was definitely evil—”“No,” said Lavender, “that’s a Chaos Legion motto, actually. Only shedidn’t do the insane laughter.”“That’s right,” Tracey said, her voice low and grim. “This time I’m notlaughing.” The girl went on stalking through the corridor, like she haddramatic music accompanying her that only she could hear.(Hermione was starting to worry about what exactly the impressionable youths of the Chaos Legion were learning from Harry Potter.)“But—I mean—” Parvati said. She still had a contemplative look onher face. “I mean, you can see why the Headmaster would think we werejust silly girls, right? What does protesting outside the Headmaster’s office have to do with becoming heroines?”“Huh,” Lavender said, now looking thoughtful herself. “That’s true.We should do something heroic. I mean heroinic.”“Um—” said Hannah, which very much expressed Hermione’s ownfeelings on the subject.“Well,” said Parvati, “has everyone already been through Dumbledore’s third-floor forbidden corridor? I mean everyone in Gryffindor’sbeen through it by now—”“Hold on!” Hermione said desperately. “I don’t want you doing anything dangerous!”There was a pause while everyone looked at Hermione, who was realizing, much too late, why Dumbledore hadn’t wanted anyone else to be ahero.“I don’t think you can become a heroine if you never do anything dangerous,” Lavender observed reasonably.“Besides,” said Padma, a considering look on her face. “Everyoneknows that nothing really bad ever happens in Hogwarts, right? To students, I mean, not to the Defense Professors. We’ve got all these ancientwards and so on.”“Um—” Hannah said again.“Yeah,” said Parvati, “the worst that can happen is that we’ll lose a fewdozen House points or something, and there’s two of us from each Houseso that’ll all come out even.”“Why, that’s brilliant, Hermione!” said Daphne in a tone of greatamazement. “The way you set it up means we can get away with anything! And I didn’t even notice your cunning plan until now!”“UM—” said Hermione, Hannah, and Susan.“Right!” said Parvati. “So now it’s time for us to become real heroines.We’ll come for the darkness—”“And make it face us—” said Lavender.“And teach it to be afraid,” Tracey Davis said grimly.ell,” Daphne whispered, keeping her voice as low as she could,“at least now I don’t feel like the only sane person in Hogwartsany more.”“Because now you’ve got the rest of us as friends?” whispered Lavender Brown, who was tiptoeing along at her left side.“I don’t think that’s what she means,” General Granger murmuredfrom Lavender’s own left.They crept slowly and carefully through the corridors of Hogwarts, alleight of them keeping both ears peeled for the slightest sound of Trouble,just like it was a battle and they were looking for enemy soldiers to ambush; only in this case they were looking for bullies to Vanquish and victims to Rescue in the span between the end of breakfast-time and whenLavender and Parvati had to get to their Herbology class.Lavender had argued that if one first-year girl could take down threeolder bullies, then eight first-year girls ought to be able to outfight twentyfour older bullies because of Multiplication.Judging by her frantic spluttering and waving of hands, General Granger hadn’t found this convincing.Padma had stayed silent for a bit during the ensuing argument, andthen observed thoughtfully that even in Hogwarts, beating up first-yeargirls probably wouldn’t be good for your reputation as a bully.Parvati had straightened up at this, exclaiming that this meant theywere the only ones who could do something about Hogwarts’s bully problem, which made it really truly heroinic. Plus the whole reason their parentshad moved to Britain was so that the two of them could attend the world’sonly magical school with a 0% fatality rate, and what was the point if theydidn’t take advantage and try a few things?To which General Granger had responded that Parvati didn’t understand the point of a perfect safety record at all—Lavender had said that if they were really all friends together and notHermione’s followers like Professor Quirrell thought, then they shouldvote on things like this.Daphne had expected that hers would be the deciding vote afterHermione and Susan and Hannah voted no. And so Daphne had considered it carefully after her first flush of enthusiasm wore off. She wasa Slytherin, after all, and that meant it was her responsibility to keep awatchful eye on their own interests while they were all running aroundtrying to help people—her job to figure out how risky it really was, andwhether it would be worth it for them, just like Mother would have donein her place. Always looking out for yourself and your friends like that,was what real Slytherining was all about…Hannah Abbott, the nervous little Hufflepuff girl, had in a small trembling voice said “Yes.”And now Daphne and Susan and Hermione had to stay with the otherfive, they couldn’t possibly let the others go off on their own. Becauseno Gryffindor would ever live down hurting the last surviving child ofthe Bones family, and no Slytherin would dare assault a daughter of theNoble and Most Ancient House of Greengrass. (Daphne hoped so, anyway.) And General Granger who’d started the whole thing… you didn’teven have to ask.The corridors of Hogwarts passed them by one after another, theirtense hands never straying far from their wands, as stone and wood andEverburning Torches came into vision and then moved past. At one pointthey heard footsteps and drew in their breath, hands almost dropping totheir wands, but it was just a lone older Ravenclaw who looked at themcuriously before sniffing and dropping his head back to his book as hewalked on.The heroines crept past solemn oaken panels carved with gilded frescos, and came to a dead end leading into a boys’ bathroom, and turnedaround, and wandered back through the solemn oaken panels carved withgilded frescos, and then turned through dusty old brick corridors groutedwith worn cement, which sort of led them in a circle actually, so they consulted a portrait and then went down a different dusty old brick corridorinstead, that took them to a brief rise of marble stairs that should’ve putthem on the third-and-a-halfth floor if it’d been anywhere but Hogwarts,and then it was back to tiled stone pavement again, and skylights that letshafts of sunlight pour down even though they were nowhere near theroof, and after they’d followed that passageway around a few corners ittook them to another boys’ bathroom, clearly marked with a plaque showing the silhouette of a robed figure whizzing into a toilet.The eight of them stood before the closed door and stared with a certain amount of weariness.“I’m bored,” said Lavender.Padma made a show of taking a pocketwatch out of her robes andlooking at it. “Sixteen minutes and thirty seconds,” she said. “A newrecord for the longest attention span in Gryffindor.”“I don’t think this is going to work either,” said Susan. “And I’m aHufflepuff.”“Y’know,” Lavender said thoughtfully, “I wonder if maybe what reallymakes someone a hero, is that when they try something like this, something interesting actually happens.”“I bet you’re right,” said Tracey. “I bet if we had Harry Potter with us,we’d run into three bullies and a hidden room full of treasure in the firstfive minutes. I bet that all General Chaos has to do is go to the bathroomand he, like, finds Slytherin’s Chamber of Secrets or something—”Daphne couldn’t quite let that one go past. “You think Lord Slytherinwould’ve put the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets in a bathroom—”“What I’m saying,” said Susan, as Tracey was opening her mouth toreply, “is that we’ve got no way of actually finding any bullies. I mean,all they’ve got to do is find a Hufflepuff somewhere, but we’ve got to runacross them at exactly the right time, d’you see? Which is a very good problem because if we did find them we’d all get squished like bugs. Can’t wejust do the forbidden third-floor corridor like we’re supposed to?”Lavender snorted scornfully. “You don’t become a real heroine just bydoing the forbidden things the Headmaster tells you not to do!”(Daphne’s mind tried to wrap around this statement as she silentlythanked the Sorting Hat for not putting her anywhere near Gryffindor.)“Come to think…” Parvati said slowly, “I mean, what’re the odds thatHarry Potter would run across those five bullies on his first morning ofschool? He must’ve had some way of finding them.”Daphne happened to be standing where looking at Parvati let her seeHermione, so she noticed the Ravenclaw girl’s expression change—andthen she realized that the Sunshine General had also found some bulliesjust recently—“Oh!” said Padma in a tone of sudden realization. “Of course! He gottold by the ghost of Salazar Slytherin!”“What?” said Daphne at the same time as several other people.“That’s who the ghost was that scared me, I’m pretty sure,” Padmaexplained. “I mean I only figured it out afterward, but… yeah. SalazarSlytherin’s ghost doesn’t like it when Slytherins bully people, he thinks itshames his name, and the ghost is still keyed into the Hogwarts wards sohe knows everything that happens, I bet.”Daphne’s mouth was hanging open; and she saw that Hannah hadput a hand to her forehead and was leaning against the stone walls, whileTracey’s eyes were blazing like little brown stars.Salazar Slytherin’s ghost?Had leagued himself with Harry Potter?And had sent Hermione Granger to stop Derrick’s crew?She would have paid a hundred Galleons to be there when Draco Malfoy got told about this.Although considering how fast rumors spread through Hogwarts,now that Padma had spilled the beans, Millicent had probably told himthirty minutes ago…In fact… now that Daphne thought about it…“So,” said Parvati. “We’ve got to ask the Boy-Who-Lived where to findSalazar Slytherin’s ghost? Wow, I guess if I’m saying stuff like that outloud, I might actually be turning into a heroine—”“Yes!” said Lavender. “We’ve got to ask the Boy-Who-Lived where tofind Salazar Slytherin’s ghost!”“We’ve got to ask… the Boy-Who-Lived… where to find SalazarSlytherin’s ghost…” repeated Hannah in a nervous voice, like she wasforcing herself to say it.“And if that doesn’t work,” shouted Tracey, “we’ll stun Harry Potter,tie him up and bring him with us!”It said something, Hermione Granger thought, and it was somethingrather sad—as the eight of them strolled back through the maze oftwisty little passages that was Hogwarts, their time before the nextclass having run out without finding any bullies—that she genuinelydidn’t know whether Harry Potter had been led around by the ghost ofSalazar Slytherin or a phoenix or what. And whatever Harry had done,she hoped it didn’t work for them. And most of all she hoped that theothers didn’t vote for Tracey’s idea of stunning Harry Potter and cartinghis unconscious body around with them to attract Adventures. Thatcouldn’t possibly work in real life, or, if it did, she was giving up.Hermione looked from witch to witch, Tracey chatting with Lavender,and the others making occasional remarks; and her gaze caught on a girlwho was subdued and quiet, the one person whose thoughts right nowshe couldn’t guess at all.“Hannah?” she said to the girl walking alongside her. Hermione triedto make her voice as gentle as she could. “You don’t have to answer, butis it okay if I ask why you voted yes on fighting bullies?”Hermione had thought she’d made her voice soft, but everyonestopped walking, and Lavender and Tracey halted their conversation andlooked at them.Hannah’s cheeks were already reddening, and just as Hannah openedher mouth—“It’s ’cause she’s got more courage than you think, obviously,” saidLavender.Hannah paused with her mouth open.She closed her mouth.She swallowed, hard and visibly, while her cheeks reddened even further.Then Hannah took a deep breath, and said, in a small voice, “There’sa boy I like.”The Hufflepuff girl flinched as she said it, and her head darted aroundnervously to look at everyone looking at her, while the pause and silencestretched.“Um, okay?” Susan said eventually.“I’ve got five boys I like,” said Lavender.“Padma and I knew we’d both like the same boys,” said Parvati, “so wemade a list and flipped a Knut to see who got to pick first.”“I know who I’m destined to marry,” said Tracey. “I don’t care whatthe world says, he’s meant to be mine!”This made all the other girls look expectantly at Hermione, whosebrain had gone ahead and flushed Tracey’s last statement entirely so itcould focus on just on the first thing Hannah had said.“Um,” said Hermione. She carefully continued keeping her voice gentle. “Hannah, the reason why you joined the Society for Promotion ofHeroic Equality for Witches was that there’s a boy who might like youmore if you become a hero?”The Hufflepuff girl nodded again, her cheeks reddening even furtherwhile she stared down at her own reflection in her black-polished shoes.“She likes Neville Longbottom, actually,” Daphne said. The Slytheringave a woeful sigh. “And unfortunately for her, he’s going to marry someone else. It’s very tragic.”This produced a high-pitched eeping sound from Hannah as she wenton staring at her feet.“Wait what?” said Lavender. “Neville’s going to marry someone else?How do you know about this? Who?”Daphne just shook her head sadly with a downcast expression.“Excuse me,” said Hermione, and then when the others looked at heragain, “Ah…” while she tried to organize her thoughts. “I mean, um… Hannah… trying to become a hero so that a boy will like you isn’t very feminist.”“It’s pronounced feminine actually,” said Padma.“And why’re you calling Hannah unfeminine?” said Susan. “There’snothing unfeminine about wanting to impress a boy.”“Besides,” said Parvati, sounding puzzled, “isn’t the whole point thatwe’re trying to be heroes even though that isn’t feminine?”The ensuing discussion would not be remembered by HermioneGranger as one of her most successful forays into the realms of politicaleducation. She tried to explain, and then after the resulting argumenttried to explain again, while the other seven girls looked at her more andmore skeptically. Afterward Daphne declared in the imperious tones ofthe future Lady Greengrass that if this feminism business meant girlsweren’t allowed to pursue boys in whichever way they pleased, thenfeminism could stay in the Muggle lands where it belonged. Lavendersuggested that maybe witchism could say that witches got to do anything they wanted, which sounded like more fun than feminism. Andfinally Padma closed off further discussion by observing wearily that shedidn’t see much point to going on arguing, since sphew wasn’t aboutanything to do with feminism in the first place, it was just about moregirls becoming heroes.Hermione had given up at that point.As their Charms session that day ended and the first-year Ravenclaws began shuffling out of the class, Hermione was already wincing to herself.They’d made it to class just barely before the opening gong, they’d had torun right over to their desks and sit down, so there hadn’t been time forthe awful thing to happen yet; but that just meant that Hermione got tolook forward to the coming disaster for the whole class.Sure enough, after Professor Flitwick squeaked his dismissal and everyone rose from their chairs, Harry began walking toward her; and forher own part Hermione shoved her book into her mokeskin pouch andvery quickly walked over to the door and threw it open and headed intothe corridors, and of course Harry followed her with a surprised look because they had a library session scheduled—“Hermione?” Harry said as he closed the door behind him. “What’swrong?”The door flew open behind Harry not a moment after he closed it, almost hitting Harry as he stepped out of the way, and Padma Patil steppedout of the classroom with a dreadful look of determination upon her face.“Excuse me, Mr. Potter,” came the awful words, the young girl’s highvoice resounding through the corridor like the gloomy bells of doom, “canI ask you for help with something?”Harry’s eyebrows drew up, and he said, “You can ask, of course.”“Can you tell us how to talk to Salazar Slytherin’s ghost? We want himto tell us where to find bullies, like he tells you.”There was a little bit of silence in the corridor outside the classroom.The door opened again, and Su peered out with an inquiring look—“Well, we’ve got to get to the library,” Harry said quite casually, hisface looking relaxed, “would you mind following us?” and began to walkoff in the direction that led to the library on odd-numbered days of themonth, and Su made like she was going to follow but Harry’s face turnedtoward her for a moment.It wasn’t until Harry had rounded a corner that he drew his wand, saidin a low precise voice “Quietus” and then turned to Padma and said, “Aninteresting guess, Miss Patil.”Padma looked rather smug, then; and said, “I should’ve figured it outearlier, really. There was that hiss in the ghost’s voice, I should’ve thoughtParselmouth right away, even before he started talking about GodricGryffindor.”Harry’s face didn’t change. “May I ask, Miss Patil, whether you’veshared this thought with—”“She said it in front of everyone in sphew,” Hermione said.Harry’s eyes had that look they had when he was very rapidly calculating something, and then he said, “Hermione, what’s the chance that—”“She said it in front of Lavender and Tracey.”“Um,” said Padma. “Should I not’ve done that?”“Wait here,” growled Mr. Goyle, and went around the corner; and therewas the sound of him knocking on Draco Malfoy’s private room.There was a bit of a queasy feeling in Tracey’s stomach, and she reminded herself again that since Padma had spilled the beans someone wasbound to tell Draco Malfoy, and it might as well be her, and it wasn’t asif she owed Harry Potter anything, and a Slytherin had to do what wasnecessary to achieve her Ambitions.She’d been collecting Ambitions ever since Professor Quirrell told heroff, and so far she’d decided that she wanted to own her own Nimbus2000 broomstick, become super famous, marry Harry Potter, eat Chocolate Frogs for breakfast every day, and defeat at least three Dark Lords justto show Professor Quirrell who was ordinary.“Mr. Malfoy will see you,” said the low, menacing voice of Mr. Goyleas he returned. “And you’d better hope he doesn’t think you’re wastinghis time.” The boy loomed at her briefly, and then stepped aside.Tracey added having her own servants to her list of Ambitions, andentered.The Malfoy private bedroom looked just like Daphne’s. She’d beenprivately hoping for diamond chandeliers or golden frescos on the walls—she’d never have said it in front of Daphne, but the House of Malfoy was astep up from Greengrass. But it was just a small bedroom like Daphne’s,and the only difference was that Malfoy’s stuff was decorated in silversnakes instead of emerald plants.As she stepped through the doorway, Draco Malfoy—who was perfectly groomed even inside his own bedroom—rose up from his deskchair to greet her with a small friendly bow, wearing a charming smilejust like she was someone who mattered, which made Tracey so flusteredthat she forgot everything she’d rehearsed inside her head and justblurted out, “I’ve got something to tell you!”“Yes, Gregory said so,” Draco Malfoy said smoothly. “Please, MissDavis, sit down.” He gestured to his own desk chair, even as he sat downon his bed.She felt somewhat lightheaded as she carefully sat herself down inMalfoy’s own chair, her fingers unthinkingly fiddling with how her dressrobes fell across her knees, trying to make them look as elegant and uncreased as Draco Malfoy’s—“So, Miss Davis,” said Draco Malfoy. “What did you want to tell me?”Tracey hesitated, and then when Malfoy’s face started to look a bitimpatient, just stammered it all out, everything Padma had said aboutSalazar Slytherin’s ghost sending Harry Potter to stop bullies and alsowhat Daphne had told her about Hermione Granger being in on it—Draco Malfoy’s expression didn’t change at all as she spoke, not evenin the slightest, and it dawned on Tracey with a sickening lurch in herstomach.“You don’t believe me!” she said.There was a slight pause.“Well,” said Draco Malfoy, with a smile that wasn’t quite as charmingas his last one, “I do believe that’s what Padma said and what Daphne said,so thank you anyway, Miss Davis.” The boy rose from where he’d beensitting on his bed, and Tracey, not even thinking, rose from the chair.As he was escorting her to the door, just as he was about to turn theknob, it occurred to Tracey that—“You didn’t ask what I wanted for theinformation,” she said.Draco Malfoy gave her some kind of look, she didn’t quite know whatit was supposed to mean, and he didn’t say anything.“Well, anyway,” Tracey said, making an on-the-spot change to her previous Plans, “I don’t want anything for the information, I was just beingfriendly.”A brief look of surprise crossed Draco Malfoy’s face for just an instantbefore his expression flattened again and he said, “It’s not that easy tobecome friends with a Malfoy, Miss Davis.”Tracey smiled, and meant it. “Well, I’ll just go on being friendly,then,” she said, and left the room with a skip in her step, feeling like areal Slytherin for maybe the first time in her life, and having just decidedthat Draco Malfoy would be one of her husbands too.After the girl was gone, Gregory came in, shut the door again and said,“Are you alright, Mr. Malfoy?”Draco said nothing to his servant and friend. His eyes gazed off intonowhere, like he was trying to stare through the wall of his bedroom,through the Hogwarts lake that surrounded the Slytherin dungeons,through Earth’s crust and atmosphere and the interstellar dust of theMilky Way, into the utterly empty and lightless void between galaxieswhich no wizard and no scientist had ever seen.“Mr. Malfoy?” Gregory said, starting to sound a little worried.“I can’t believe I believed every word of that,” said Draco.Daphne finished her final inch of Transfiguration and looked up acrossthe Slytherin common room, at where Millicent Bulstrode was still working on her own homework. It was time to come to a Decision.If sphew did go around trying to stun bullies, the bullies wouldn’t likeit, that was certain. And they’d try to do something unpleasant about it,which was also certain. On the other hand, if the bullies got really nastythen Hermione could ask Harry Potter for help, or they could pool theircombined Quirrell points and ask the Defense Professor for a favor… No,the thing that Daphne was really worried about was if this business gotthem in bad with Professor Snape. You didn’t want to ever end up on thewrong side of Professor Snape.But since the day she’d challenged Neville to a Most Ancient Duel,she’d noticed people looking at her differently. Even the Slytherinswho’d made fun of her were looking at her differently. It was dawningon Daphne that being the daughter of the Noble and Most Ancient Houseof Greengrass brought in a lot more respect if you were a beautiful heroineborn to a Most Ancient House, and not just a pretty noble girl. It wasthe difference between having your role played by the lead actress andhaving your role played by a two-Galleon extra with a screechy laugh.Fighting bullies might not be the best way to become a heroine. ButFather had once told her that the trouble with passing up opportunitieswas that it was habit-forming. If you told yourself you were waiting for abetter opportunity next time, why, next time you’d probably tell yourselfthe same thing. Father had said that most people spent their whole liveswaiting for an opportunity that was good enough, and then they died. Father had said that while seizing opportunities would mean that all sorts ofthings went wrong, it wasn’t nearly as bad as being a hopeless lump. Father had said that after she got into the habit of seizing opportunities, thenit was time to start being picky about them.On the other hand, Mother had warned her not to take all of Father’sadvice, and said that Daphne wasn’t allowed to ask about Father’s sixthyear in Hogwarts until she was at least thirty years old.But in the end Father had gotten Mother to marry him and successfully plotted his way into a Most Ancient House, so there was that.Millicent Bulstrode finished her homework and began putting herthings away.Daphne stood up from her desk, and walked over.Millicent swung out her legs from the table and stood up, slingingher bookbag over one shoulder, then looked over at where Daphne wasapproaching, the girl’s expression puzzled.“Hey, Millicent,” Daphne said as she drew near, making her voice lowand excited, “guess what I figured out today?”“The thing about Salazar Slytherin’s ghost helping Granger?” said Millicent. “I already heard about that—”“No,” Daphne said in a hushed whisper, “this is even better.”“Really?” Millicent said, in an equally low excited voice. “What is it?”Daphne looked around conspiratorially. “Come to my room and I’lltell you.”They went off toward the stairs that led downward, the private roomswere even lower in the lake than the seventh-year dorms…Soon enough Daphne was sitting in her comfy desk-chair and Millicent had bounced over to the edge of her bed.“Quietus,” said Daphne, when they were both seated; and then insteadof putting her wand away inside her robes, Daphne just let her hand fallnaturally down to her side, still holding the wand, just in case.“All right!” said Millicent. “What is it?”“You know what I figured out?” said Daphne. “I figured out that youget the gossip so fast, you know about things before they actually happen.”Daphne had half-expected Millicent to turn white and fall over, andshe didn’t really, but the girl did flinch pretty hard before she startedstammering denials.“Don’t worry,” said Daphne with her sweetest smile, “I won’t tell anyone else you’re a seer. I mean, we’re friends, right?”Rianne Felthorne, seventh-year of Slytherin, was working diligently onyet another two-foot essay (she was taking everything except Divinationand Muggle Studies and her N.E.W.T. year seemed to consist entirely ofhomework) when her Head of House strode up to the table she was working at and barked “You will come with me, Miss Felthorne!” and walkedaway even as she frantically began putting away her parchment and bookand quill.When she caught up with Professor Snape, he was waiting just outside the room and gazing at her with half-lidded eyes that seemed far toointense; and before she could ask what this was about he spun without aword and stalked off through the hallways, so that she had to scramble tokeep up.Their walk took them down a flight of stairs, and then another, below what she’d thought was the lowest level of the Slytherin dungeons.And the corridors began to look older in their appearance, the architecture reverting back in time by centuries into roughened stone held together by crude-looking mortar. She began to wonder if Professor Snapewas taking her to the real dungeons that she’d heard rumors of, the truedungeons of Hogwarts that had been sealed off to all but faculty; and ifmaybe Professor Snape did terrible things down there to innocent helpless young girls but that was probably just wishful thinking on her part.They went down another flight of stairs, and came out into a roomthat was no room at all, but an empty rock cavern with a single door,pierced by many dark openings and lit by a single torch of ancient stylethat fired as they entered.Professor Snape took out his wand, then, and began to cast Charmafter Charm, she lost track of how many; and when the Potions Masterwas done he turned back toward her, locked his intense eyes on hers, andsaid in a level voice unlike his usual drawl, “You will say nothing to anyoneof this matter, Miss Felthorne, nothing now or ever. If that is acceptableto you, nod. If not, we will turn and go.”She nodded, frightened and with a strange hope dawning in her heart(well, not exactly her heart).“The task I have for you is very simple, Miss Felthorne,” said ProfessorSnape’s toneless voice, “and your extremely generous pay of fifty Galleonsis merely to compensate you for being Memory-Charmed afterward.”She drew an involuntary breath. Her family might be rich but theyhad other daughters and kept her on a tight leash and it was certainly alot of money for her.Then her ears caught up with the words Memory-Charmed and for amoment she felt outraged, there was no point if she couldn’t keep thememories, what sort of girl did Professor Snape think she was?“You surely know,” said Severus Snape, “of Miss Hermione Granger,the Sunshine General?”“What?” said Rianne Felthorne in sudden horror and disgust. “She’sin her first year! Ew!”he winter Sun had well set by the time dinner ended, and so itwas amid the peaceful light of stars twinkling down from the enchanted ceiling of the Great Hall that Hermione left for the RavenclawTower alongside her study partner Harry Potter, who lately seemed tohave a ridiculous amount of time for studying. She hadn’t the faintestidea of when Harry was doing his actual homework, except that it wasgetting done, maybe by house elves while he slept.Nearly every single pair of eyes in the whole Hall lay on them as theypassed through the mighty doors of the dining-room, which were morelike siege gates of a castle than anything students ought to go through onthe way back from supper.They went out without speaking, and walked until the distant babbleof student conversation had faded into silence; and then the two of themwent on a little further through the stone corridors before Hermione finally spoke.“Why’d you do that, Harry?”“Do what?” said the Boy-Who-Lived in an abstracted tone, as if hismind were quite elsewhere, thinking about vastly more important things.“I mean, why didn’t you just tell them no?”“Well,” Harry said, as their shoes pattered across the tiles, “I can’t justgo around saying ‘no’ every time someone asks me about something Ihaven’t done. I mean, suppose someone asks me, ‘Harry, did you pull theprank with the invisible paint?’ and I say ‘No’ and then they say ‘Harry,do you know who messed with the Gryffindor Seeker’s broomstick?’ andI say ‘I refuse to answer that question.’ It’s sort of a giveaway.”“And that’s why,” Hermione said carefully, “you told everyone…” Sheconcentrated, rembering the exact words. “That if hypothetically therewas a conspiracy, you could not confirm or deny that the true master ofthe conspiracy was Salazar Slytherin’s ghost, and in fact you wouldn’teven be able to admit the conspiracy existed so people ought to stop asking you questions about it.”“Yep,” said Harry Potter, smiling slightly. “That’ll teach them to takehypothetical scenarios too seriously.”“And you told me not to answer anything—”“They might not believe you, if you deny it,” said Harry. “So it’s betterto say nothing, unless you want them to think you’re a liar.”“But—” Hermione said helplessly. “But—but now people think I’m doing things for Salazar Slytherin!” The way the Gryffindors had been looking at her—the way the Slytherins had been looking at her—“It goes along with being a hero,” Harry said. “Have you seen what theQuibbler says about me?”For a brief second Hermione imagined her parents reading a newspaper article about her, and instead of the story being about her winning anationwide spelling bee or any of the other ways she’d imagined gettinginto the papers, the headline said “HERMIONE GRANGER GETS DRACOIt was enough to make you think twice about the whole heroine business.Harry’s voice turned a bit more formal. “Speaking of which, MissGranger, how goes your latest quest?”“Well,” said Hermione, “unless the ghost of Salazar Slytherin reallydoes show up and tell us where to find bullies, I don’t think we’re going tohave much luck.” Not that she was sorry about that.She glanced over at Harry, and saw the boy giving her a peculiarlyintense look.“You know, Hermione,” the boy said quietly, as though to make surethat nobody else in the world heard, “I think you’re right. I think somepeople get a lot more help than others in becoming heroes. And I don’tthink that’s fair, either.”And Harry grabbed at her witch’s robes where they lay over her arm,and hustled her into a side-hall of the corridor they were walking through,her mouth gaping open in surprise even as Harry’s wand came into hishand, they rounded a curve of the side-hall and it was so narrow that itwas almost pushing her and Harry into each other, even as Harry pointedto the way they’d come and softly said “Quietus”, then a moment later, inthe other direction, “Quietus” again.The boy looked searchingly around them, not just to every side, buteven upward toward the ceiling and down toward the floor.And then Harry stuck a hand in his pouch and said, “Invisibilitycloak.”“Gleep?” said Hermione.Harry was already drawing out folds of shimmering black fabricfrom the mokeskin device. “Don’t worry,” the boy said with a smallgrin, “they’re so rare that nobody bothered to make a school rule againstthem…”And then Harry held out the dark velvet mesh to her, and said, hisvoice strangely formal, “I do not give you, but loan you, my cloak, untoHermione Jean Granger. Protect her well.”She stared at the shimmering velvet of the cloak, cloth that swallowedall the light that fell on it except what glinted from small strange reflections, fabric so perfectly black it should’ve shown dust or lint or somethingbut it didn’t, the longer you looked the more you felt like what you wereseeing wasn’t really there at all, but then you blinked again and it was justa black cloak.“Take it, Hermione.”Hardly even thinking, Hermione stretched out her hand to grasp thefabric; and then just as her brain woke up and she started to pull her handback, Harry let go of the cloak and it started to fall and she grabbed at itwithout thinking. And the instant her fingers touched and held the cloakshe felt an intangible jolt run through her like picking up her wand forthe first time; and it was like she heard a song being sung, ever so faintly,in the back of her mind.“That’s one of my quest items, Hermione,” Harry said softly. “It belonged to my father, and it’s not something I can replace, if it’s lost. Don’tloan it to anyone else, don’t show it to anyone, don’t tell anyone it exists…but if you want to borrow it for a while, just come to me and ask.”Hermione finally tore her eyes loose from the depthless black foldsand stared back up at Harry.“I can’t—”“You certainly can,” Harry said. “Because there’s nothing even the tiniest bit fair about my finding this gift-wrapped in a box next to my bed onemorning, and you… not.” Harry paused thoughtfully. “Unless you did getyour own invisibility cloak, in which case never mind.”Then the implications of invisibility cloak finally dawned on her, andshe pointed a shocked finger at Harry, though they were close enough together that she couldn’t quite straighten her arm properly, and her voicerose with considerable indignation as she said, “So that’s how you disappeared from the Potions closet! And the time when—” and then shetrailed off, because even with an invisibility cloak she still couldn’t see howHarry had…Harry buffed his fingernails on his robes with artful nonchalance, andsaid, “Well, you knew there had to be some trick to it, right? And now theheroine will mysteriously know where and when to find bullies—just likeshe listened to the bullies planning it, even though nobody her age couldpossibly have turned herself invisible to spy on them.”There was a pause and a silence.“Harry—” she said. “I‘m—I’m not sure anymore that fighting bulliesis such a good idea.”Harry’s eyes stayed steady on hers. “Because the other girls might gethurt?”She nodded, just nodded.“That’s their choice, Hermione, just like it’s yours. I decided not to dothe obvious stupid thing that everyone does in books, try to keep you safeand protected and helpless, and have you get really angry at me, and pushme away while you go off on your own and get into even more trouble, andthen heroically pull through it successfully, after which I’d finally have myepiphany and realize that blah blah blah etcetera. I know how that partof my life story goes, so I’m just skipping over it. If I can predict what I’mgoing to think later, I might as well go ahead and think it now. Anyway,my point is, you shouldn’t smother your friends to keep them safe, either.Just tell them up front it’s predictably going to go horribly wrong, and ifthey still want to be heroines after that, fine.”It was at times like this that Hermione wondered if she was ever goingto get used to the way Harry thought. “Harry, I really,” her voice stuck fora second, “really, really don’t want them getting hurt! Especially becauseof something I started!”“Hermione,” Harry said seriously, “I’m pretty sure you did the rightthing. I don’t see what could realistically happen to them that would beworse for them, in the long run, than not trying.”“What if they get badly hurt?” Hermione said. Her voice felt blockedin her throat; she remembered Captain Ernie saying how Harry had juststared straight into the eyes of a bully as the bully bent his finger back,before Professor Sprout had arrived to save him; and there was anotherthought that came after that, about Hannah and her delicate hands withthe fingernails that she carefully painted in Hufflepuff yellow every morning, but that wasn’t allowed to be imagined. “And then—they’ll never doanything courageous, ever again—”“I don’t think it works like that,” Harry said steadily. “Even if it allgoes mind-bogglingly wrong, I don’t think it works like that inside a human mind. The important thing is believing about yourself that you’resomeone who can break your boundaries. Trying and getting hurt can’tpossibly be worse for you than being… stuck.”“What if you’re wrong, Harry?”Harry paused for a moment, and then shrugged a little sadly, and said,“What if I’m right?”Hermione looked back at the black mesh running over her hand.From the inside the cloak felt strangely soft and yet firm against herpalm, as if it was trying to give her hand a reassuring hug.Then she lifted her arm back up, holding the cloak back to Harry.Harry didn’t move to take it.1101 *“I—” said Hermione. “I mean, thank you, thank you a lot, but I’m stillthinking about it, so you can take it back for now. And… Harry, I don’tthink it’s right to spy on people—”“Not even on known bullies, to rescue their victims?” Harry said. “I’venever been bullied, but I’ve been through a realistic simulation, and itdidn’t feel very pleasant. Have you ever been bullied, Hermione?”“No,” she said in a quiet voice, and went on holding out Harry’s invisibility cloak to him.Finally Harry took back his cloak—she felt a small twitch of loss as theinaudible song vanished from the back of her mind—and started to stuffthe black material back into his pouch.As the pouch ate the last of the fabric, Harry turned from her, to breakthe Quieting Barrier—“And, um,” Hermione said. “That’s not the Cloak of Invisibility, is it?The one we read about in the library on page eighteen of Paula Vieira’stranslation of Gottschalk’s An Illustrated Scroll of Lost Devices?”Harry turned his head back, grinning slightly, and said in exactly thesame tone of voice he’d used earlier with the other students at dinner,“I cannot confirm or deny that I possess magical artifacts of incrediblepower.”When Hermione climbed into bed that night she was still trying to decide.Her life had been simpler at dinnertime, back when there hadn’t been anypractical way for them to find bullies; and now she had to choose again;not for herself, this time, but for her friends. In her mind’s eye she keptseeing Dumbledore’s lined face and the pain it hadn’t quite hidden, and inher mind’s ears she kept hearing Harry’s voice saying ‘That’s their choice,Hermione, just like it’s yours.’And her hand kept remembering the sensation of the cloak againsther fingers, replaying it over and over in her mind. There was a powerto the feeling that compelled her thoughts to return to it, and to the songshe’d heard / hadn’t heard in a part of her mind and magic which now laysilent once more.1102 *Harry had spoken to the cloak like it was a person, telling it to take goodcare of her. Harry had said the cloak had belonged to his father, that hecouldn’t replace it if it was lost…But… Harry wouldn’t really do that, would he?Just hand her one of the three Deathly Hallows created centuries before Hogwarts?She could say that she felt flattered, but this went way beyond feelingflattered, into making her wonder just what she was to Harry, exactly.Maybe Harry was the sort of person who went around loaning ancientlost magical artifacts to anyone he considered a friend, but—But when she thought about which part of his life Harry had said he’dskipped over, the part where he tried to keep her safe and protected…Hermione stared up at the ceiling of the Ravenclaw dorm. Somewhere beyond her bed, Mandy and Su were talking. She’d turned up herQuieting Charm to where she couldn’t hear the exact words, but couldstill hear their faint murmur; there was something comforting aboutsleeping in a dorm with the other girls. Harry kept his own Quieterturned up all the way, she knew.She was starting to wonder if maybe Harry actually did, well…You know…Like her.It took Hermione Granger a long time to fall asleep that night.And when she woke up the next morning there was a small slip ofparchment peeking out from under her pillow which said At half-past tenyou will find a bully in the fourth passageway to the left of the hall leaving thePotions classroom—S.When Hermione entered the Great Hall that morning, her stomachwas filled with flying butterflies the size of Hippogriffs; even as sheapproached the Ravenclaw breakfast table she still hadn’t decided whatto do.There was an empty place next to Padma, she saw. That would bewhere to sit down, if she was going to tell Padma and then ask Padma totell Daphne and Tracey.Hermione walked toward the empty place next to Padma.There were words waiting in her throat, Padma, I got a mysteriousmessage—And she could feel a huge brick wall inside her, stopping the wordsfrom coming out. She’d be putting Hannah and Susan and Daphne indanger. Taking them and leading them by the hand straight into trouble.That was Wrong.Or she could just go try to handle the bully herself, without telling herfriends anything, and that, quite obviously, was also Wrong.Hermione knew she was being faced with a Moral Dilemma, just likeall those wizards and witches she’d read about in stories. Only in storiespeople always got a right choice and a wrong choice, not two wrong ones,which seemed a bit unfair. But she had the sense, somehow—maybeit came from the way Harry always talked about how the history bookswould see them—that she was faced with a Heroic Decision, and that herwhole life might end up going one way or another, depending on whatshe chose right now, this morning.Hermione sat down at the table without looking to either side, justgazing at the plate and silverware like they might have answers hiddeninside, thinking as hard as she ever had, and a few seconds later she heardPadma’s voice whispering almost in her ear, “Daphne says she knowswhere a bully’s going to be at ten-thirty today.”Doomed.They were all doomed, in Susan Bones’s opinion.Auntie sometimes told stories which started out like this, people doing something they knew was stupid, and the stories usually ended withsomeone being doomed all over the floor and all over the walls and gettingon Auntie’s shoes.“Hey, Padma,” muttered Parvati, her voice just barely audible overthe soft impacts of eight girls tiptoeing through the corridor leading tothe Potions classroom, “d’you know why Hermione’s been sighing allmorning—”“No talking!” hissed Lavender, the harsh whisper sounding muchlouder than Parvati’s mutter. “You never know when Evil might belistening!”“Shhh!” said three other girls even more loudly.Utterly, totally, quite extremely doomed.As they approached the fourth passageway to the left of the Potionsclassroom, where Daphne’s mysterious informant had said the bullyingwould take place, the eight of them moved slower, the sound of their feetgot softer, and finally General Granger made the gesture that meant Halt,I’ll look ahead.Lavender raised a hand, then, and when Hermione turned to look ather, Lavender, looking puzzled, pointed straight down the corridor, gestured to herself, and then tried to sign something else that Susan didn’tunderstand—General Granger shook her head, and once again, this time withslower, more exaggerated movements, made the sign for Halt, I’ll lookahead.Lavender, looking even more puzzled, pointed back the way they’dcome, and made a bouncing gesture with her other hand.Now everyone else was looking even more confused than Lavender,and Susan thought with some acerbity that evidently one hour of practicedone two days ago wasn’t enough to remember a new set of code signals.Hermione pointed at Lavender, then at the floor beneath Lavender’sfeet, the expression on her face making it very clear that the intendedmeaning was You. Stay. Here.Lavender nodded.Doom doom doom, went the words of the Chaos Legion’s marching songthrough Susan’s mind, doom doom doom doom doom doom…Hermione reached into her robes, and drew out a little rod with a mirror on the end of it and an eyepiece. Very very softly indeed, the Raven*1105 *claw girl crept up to the wall, right next to where the passageway openedoff the corridor, and peeked just the tip of the eyepiece around the corner.Then a little more.Then a little more.Then General Granger cautiously stuck her head around the side.General Granger turned back to them, nodded, and made the handgesture for follow me.Susan felt a little better as she crept forward. The part of the Planwhich called for them to arrive thirty minutes before the bully had, apparently, actually worked. Maybe they were only slightly doomed…?At ten-twenty-nine, almost on the dot, the bully showed up. If anyonehad been present to hear—though the corridor was apparently empty—they would have heard his shoes clicking solidly through the main corridor, entering the passageway, walking toward where the passagewayturned its first corner, turning that corner, and then stopping in somesurprise upon seeing that the passageway now terminated in a solid brickwall where no wall had been before.Then the bully shrugged and turned away, as he leaned back to watchthe main passage from just around the corner.It was the castle Hogwarts, after all.Behind the hastily Transfigured thin panels they’d assembled into theoutward appearance of a brick wall, the girls waited; not speaking, notmoving, hardly even breathing, but watching through the eyeholes they’dleft themselves.As Susan’s gaze took in the bully, she could feel the tightening of herchest all the way into her toes. The boy looked to be in his seventh-year ifnot older, and his robes were trimmed in green instead of the red they’dbeen hoping for, and he had muscles, and after staring for a bit longer,Susan realized his stance had the balance that meant that he dueled.1106 *Then they all heard the sound of more feet approaching from the corridor. The fourth-year Gryffindors and Slytherins had just been let out ofPotions class.The footsteps pattered past, and diminished and faded, and the bullydidn’t do anything. For a moment Susan felt an instant of relief—Then another, smaller group of footsteps approached.The bully still didn’t do anything, as the footsteps went past.That happened a few more times.And then, as there approached the faintly audible sound of one lastset of footsteps, the seven girls heard the bully’s voice saying, clear andcold and quiet, “Protego”.Someone did gasp then, though fortunately very very quietly. If theycouldn’t get in even a single shot—The bullies were learning already, Susan realized, she hadn’t expectedsphew to be able to do this very often before the bullies caught on—but—Hermione had already defeated three bullies—and the school had beenbuzzing with speculation about Salazar Slytherin’s ghost, yesterday—He’s expecting us!Susan would have whispered to give up, to abort the plan, only therewas no way to convey a message to—“Silencio,” said the bully in a soft, deliberate voice with his wandpointed toward the corridor, the blue haze of his Shielding Charmshimmering around him. “Accio victim.”When the fourth-year boy came into their field of vision he was dangling upside down as if an invisible hand were holding him high by oneleg, his red-trimmed robes beginning to slide down his thighs to revealthe pants beneath. His mouth was opening and closing helpessly, nosound coming out.“I suppose you’re wondering what’s going on,” the seventh-yearSlytherin said in a quiet, cold voice. “Don’t worry. It’s so simple even aGryffindor could understand.”With that, the Slytherin’s left hand formed a fist and drove hard intothe Gryffindor’s belly. The fourth-year boy’s body jerked around frantically, but still no words left his mouth.1107 *“You’re my victim,” said the older Slytherin. “I’m a bully. I’m going tobeat you up. And we’ll see if anyone stops me.”It was at that moment that Susan realized it was a trap.And in almost the same moment, there rang out the mighty and highpitched voice of a young girl, crying, “Stop, evildoer! Finite Incantatem!”Lavender, thought Susan, agonized. The Gryffindor girl had volunteered to be a distraction, while the rest of them executed a flank attackfrom where the bully wouldn’t expect it, that had been the plan, onlynow—“In the name of Hogwarts,” cried Lavender’s voice, though theycouldn’t see her, “and in the name of heroines everywhere, I commandyou to let go of that EEK!”“Expelliarmus,” said the bully. “Stupefy. Accio stupid heroine.”When Lavender floated into their vision, dangling by one foot andunconscious, Susan blinked; the girl was dressed in a bright crimson-andgold skirt and blouse, instead of her usual Hogwarts robes.The bully was also giving the girl’s upside-down body an odd look,and then he pointed his wand at her and said “Finite Incantatem,” but theclothes stayed the same.Then the bully shrugged, and, still facing in the direction of Lavenderinstead of the dangling fourth-year boy, drew back his fist—“Lagann!” yelled five voices, and five green spirals blasted from fivewands aimed through five holes in the false wall, and an instant later Hermione’s voice shouted “Stupefy!”Five green spirals shattered ineffectually on blue haze, and Hermione’s red bolt bounced off the haze and struck the fourth-year boy, whojerked and then was still.And the seventh-year bully turned around, smiling grimly, as the firstyear girls screamed and charged.Susan’s eyes flew open and instantly she was rolling away from whereshe’d lain on the floor, her lungs still on fire and her whole body stillaching from when she’d been hit, the battle had only moved forward afew seconds from what she could see, Hannah’s body falling with herarm still stretched out toward Susan, “Glisseo!” shouted Hermione butthe older boy just slashed his wand down leaving a trail of green glowbehind and Hermione’s Charm visibly disrupted into a shower of bluewhite sparks, then in almost the same motion the bully said “Stupefy!”and Hermione was blown backward and Susan summoned up all themagic she had left and shouted “Innervate!” at Hermione’s body even asthe bully turned toward her, the bully’s wand pointed in her directionagain and then Padma yelled “Prismatis!” just before the bully shouted“Impedimenta!”, the rainbow sphere forming around the bully and theseventh-year Slytherin staggered as his own hex was reflected back athim, but an instant later the bully’s wand swept back to tap himself andthen Padma’s Prismatic Sphere shattered like a blown soap bubble as thebully’s wand cut through it and “Innervate!” yelled Parvati at Hannah’sbody and Tracey and Lavender screamed at the same time, “WingardiumLeviosa!”—Hannah Abbott held out her wand with a hand that trembled with exhaustion, she didn’t have enough magic left for even one Innervate, now.The rest of the passageway was silent, scattered bodies lying acrossthe ground, Padma and Tracey and Lavender, Hermione and Parvati ina heap against one wall, Susan standing in petrified rigor as her eyestracked it all helplessly, even the Gryffindor boy lying sprawled and motionless (Hermione had woken him and he’d fought, but it hadn’t beenenough).It had been a very short battle.The bully was still smiling, the only signs of his exertion a waveringripple in the blue glow surrounding him, and a few beads of sweat on hisforehead.The bully raised his arm, wiped the sweat off his forehead, and stalkedtoward her like a man-shaped living Lethifold.Hannah turned and fled, spun and ran with screams kept bound inher choking throat, sprinted past the fallen paneling of the fake brick wall,ran down the passageway with all the speed she could muster, weavingas much as she could—Just before Hannah got to the turn in the passageway, the bully’s voicefrom behind her said “Cluthe!” and she got awful cramps all through herlegs, she fell down and slid and hit her head against the wall, only shedidn’t even notice the pain of the smack as she started to scream with thetwisting muscles—The bully was still stalking toward her, Hannah saw as she turned herhead; approaching her slowly, still wearing that dreadful smile.And she rolled, despite the pain as her leg muscles knotted uparound themselves, she rolled around the corner of the passageway, andscreamed, “Go away!”“I think not,” said the bully, his voice deep and scary like that of agrown man, sounding very close at hand now.The bully walked around the corner and Daphne Greengrass stabbedher Most Ancient Blade directly into his groin.There was a flash that lit up the whole corridor—It was with a subdued mien that seven girls left Madam Pomfrey’s office,leaving one of their own behind in a hospital bed.Hannah would be all right in about thirty-five minutes, the healer hadsaid; torn muscles were easy to mend.Daphne had done all the talking, and according to her, Hannah hadsuffered a mishap with a Road-Running Charm which had caused the legcramps. Madam Pomfrey had given them a sharp look but hadn’t argued,even though that Charm was around six years above their level.Madam Pomfrey had also given Daphne a potion to help with her stateof total magical exhaustion, and warned her not to cast any spells for thenext three hours. That, supposedly, was from Daphne using up too much1110 *magic trying to Finite Hannah, rather than the Most Ancient Blade drawing out all of her power to break the Protego.The rest of them had decided not to say anything about the bruises under their robes until they could get some older girls to cast Episkey. Therewere limits to what Daphne could talk around.The whole thing, Susan thought, had been too close, much too close.If the bully had so much as looked around the corner—if he’d taken a moment to recast his Shielding Charm—“We should stop,” said Susan, as soon as the seven of them had gottenout of hearing range of the healer’s office. “We should stop doing this.”For some reason, then, even though they were supposed to vote onthis sort of thing, everyone turned to look at General Granger.The Sunshine General didn’t seem to see them looking at her, she juststrode on, gazing off straight ahead.After a little while, Hermione Granger said, in a voice that soundedthoughtful and a little sad, “Hannah said she didn’t want us to stop. I’mnot sure it’s right for us to… be less brave for her, than she is.”All the other girls, except Susan, nodded at that.“I think that’s got to be as bad as it gets,” said Parvati. “And we canhandle it. We’ve proved that now.”Susan couldn’t think of anything to say to that. She didn’t think thatshrieking at the top of her lungs about blatant stupidity and DOOMwould be persuasive. And she couldn’t just leave the other girls, either.Wasn’t it enough to be cursed with hard work, why did Hufflepuffs haveto be loyal on top of everything else?“By the way, Lavender,” said Padma. “What in the name of Merlin’sunderpants were you wearing back there?”“My hero outfit,” said the Gryffindor girl.Daphne sounded weary, as she spoke without turning her own headfrom where she was plodding through the hall. “It’s the costume of theSoldier of Gryffindor from the play Chronicles of the Lunarian Soldiers.”“Did you Transfigure it?” said Parvati, looking puzzled. “But the bullycast Finite on you—”“Nope!” Lavender said. “It’s real! See, I just Transfigured my herooutfit into a regular shirt and skirt beforehand, so all I had to do was castFinite on myself after I saw the bully. Do you want your own, Parvati? Igot mine made yesterday by Katarina and Joshua in sixth-year, for twelveSickles—”“I think,” General Granger said in a careful voice, “that would makeus all look a little silly.”“Well,” said Lavender, “we should vote on whether to—”“I think,” General Granger said, “that no matter what anyone votes, I’mnot going to be caught dead wearing one of those costumes—”Susan ignored the argument. She was trying to think up some sort ofclever strategy for being less doomed.The whole Great Hall went silent, even if only for a moment, as the sevenof them walked into lunch.Then the applause started.It was scattered, not the massive applause of everyone applauding atonce. A lot of it came from the Gryffindor table, less from Hufflepuff andRavenclaw, and none from Slytherin.Daphne felt her face tightening. She’d hoped—well, maybe after theyfound a Gryffindor bully to stop and a Slytherin to rescue, her fellowSlytherins would realize—She looked at the Hufflepuff table.Neville Longbottom was applauding with his hands held high abovehis head, although he wasn’t smiling. Maybe he’d heard about Hannah,or maybe he was wondering why Hannah wasn’t there.Then, not quite able to help herself, she glanced toward the Head Table.Professor Sprout’s face was lined with concern. She and ProfessorMcGonagall were leaning their heads toward Headmaster Dumbledore,who had a solemn look, and all their lips were moving quickly. ProfessorFlitwick looked more resigned than anything else, and Quirrell, face slack,was taking trembling stabs at his soup using a spoon gripped in a fist.Professor Snape was looking directly at—Her?Or—at Hermione Granger, standing next to her?A small, thin smile crossed the Potions Master’s face, and he raised hishands, brought them together once in a motion that was too slow to be areal clap; and then the Potions Master turned back to his plate, ignoringthe conversations around him.Daphne felt a little chill go down her spine, and she hastily turned towalk toward the Slytherin table. Susan and Lavender and Parvati peeledoff from their group, heading toward the Hufflepuff and Gryffindor tables on the other side of the Great Hall.It happened as they were passing the part of the Slytherin table wherethe Slytherin Quidditch team sat.That was when Hermione stumbled suddenly, stumbled hard likeshe was being yanked off her feet, and went sprawling into the gap between where Marcus Flint and Lucian Bole sat, and there was a sad littlesplutching sound as Hermione’s face ended up in Flint’s plate of steakand mashed potatoes.Everything seemed to happen too quickly then, or maybe it was justDaphne herself who was thinking too slow, as Flint let out a bellow ofindignation and his hand yanked Hermione back and threw her into theRavenclaw table, and she bounced off a student’s back and collapsed ontothe ground—The quiet spread out in ripples.Hermione pushed herself up on her hands, though she didn’t get allthe way to her feet, Daphne could see that her whole body was shaking,and that her face was still covered with mashed potatoes with scatteredpieces of steak.For a long moment, nobody spoke, nobody moved. Like nobody inthe whole Great Hall could imagine, any more than Daphne could, whathappened next.Then Flint’s powerful voice, the voice of the Slytherin Captain thatbellowed commands on the Quidditch pitch, said in a dangerous rumble,“You ruined my food, girl.”Another moment of frozen silence. Hermione’s head—Daphne couldsee it trembling—turned to look at the Slytherin Quidditch Captain.“Apologize to me,” said Flint.Harry Potter started to push himself up from the Ravenclaw table,and then stopped abruptly, halfway to his feet, as if he’d just thought ofsomething—Then five other people stood up from the Ravenclaw table.All of the Slytherin Quidditch team stood up, their wands coming intotheir hands, and then students stood up at the Gryffindor table and at theHufflepuff table and without thinking Daphne turned to look at the HeadTable and she saw that the Headmaster was still sitting down, watching,just watching, Dumbledore was just watching and he had one hand out asthough to restrain Professor McGonagall—in just one second someonewould shout a spell and then it would be too late, why wasn’t the Headmasterdoing anything—And a voice said, “My apologies.”Daphne turned back to look, her mouth gaping open in absoluteshock.“Scourgify,” said that smooth voice, and the mashed potatoes vanishedfrom Hermione’s face, revealing the Ravenclaw’s surprised expression asDraco Malfoy approached her, sheathed his wand again, and then kneltto one knee beside her and offered her a hand.“Sorry about that, Miss Granger,” said Draco Malfoy’s polite voice. “Iguess someone thought they were being funny.”Hermione took Draco’s hand, and Daphne suddenly realized whatwas about to happen—But Draco Malfoy didn’t raise Hermione halfway up and then dropher.He just pulled her to her feet.“Thanks,” said Hermione.“You’re welcome,” Draco Malfoy said in a loud voice, not looking to either side to see where all four Houses of Hogwarts were staring at him intotal shock. “Just remember, being cunning and ambitious doesn’t mean“Can I have a kiss first?” said Rianne Felthorne.Snape’s black eyes studied her so intensely that her blush started toreach all the way to her chest, and she wondered if he knew perfectly wellthat she was still being weak, and it wasn’t a kiss she’d truly wanted.“Why not,” the Potions Master said quietly, and he leaned his headdown over the sofa and kissed her.It was nothing like she’d imagined. In her fantasies Snape’s kisseswere fierce, seized from her, but this was—it was just awkward, actually.Snape’s lips pressed down too hard on hers, forcing them back againsther teeth, and the angle wasn’t right and their noses were sort of bendingand his lips were too tight and—Only as the Potions Master straightened back up again, raising hiswand once more, did she realize.“That wasn’t—” she said in a wondering voice, looking up at him.“That wasn’t—was it—your first—”Rianne Felthorne blinked at the stone cavern she’d discovered, stillholding the extraordinary ruby she’d found embedded in the dirt of onecorner. It was an incredible windfall, and she didn’t know why looking atthe ruby made her feel so sad, like she’d forgotten something, somethingthat had been precious to her.t was Saturday, on the 4th of April, in the year 1992.Mr. and Mrs. Davis looked rather nervous, as they sat in a certain special section of the Hogwarts Quidditch stands—though todaythe cushioned benches did not look upon flying broomsticks, but ratherviewed a gigantic square of something like parchment; a great whiteblankness soon to flicker with windows into grass and soldiers. Fornow it showed only the reflected dull gray color of the surroundingovercast skies. (Looking rather stormy, though the weather-wizards hadpromised that the rain wouldn’t break before nightfall.)Ordinarily it was the ancient tradition of Hogwarts that mere parentswere to Stay Out—for much the same reason that impatient children aretold to get out of the kitchen and not meddle in the cook’s affairs. Theonly reason for a parent-teacher conference was if a teacher felt that aparent wasn’t shaping up properly. It took an exceptional circumstanceto make the Hogwarts administration feel that it had to justify itself toyou. On any given occasion, generally speaking, the Hogwarts administration was backed up by eight hundred years of distinguished historyand you were not.Thus it had been with some trepidation that Mr. and Mrs. Davis hadinsisted on an audience with Deputy Headmistress McGonagall. It washard to muster a proper sense of indignation when you were confrontingthe same dignified witch who, twelve years and four months earlier, hadgiven both of you two weeks’ detention after catching you in the act ofconceiving Tracey.On the other hand, Mr. and Mrs. Davis’s courage had been helped byangrily waving about a copy of The Quibbler whose headline showed, inbright bold text for all the world to see:Pacts With Potter?Bones, Davis, GrangerIn Love Rectangle Of FearAnd so Mr. and Mrs. Davis had argued their way into the Faculty Boxof the Hogwarts Quidditch stands, where they were now ensconced withan excellent view of Professor Quirrell’s enchanted screens, so that thetwo of them could see for themselves “Just what the Fiddly-Snocks hasbeen going on in this school, if you’ll pardon the expression, Deputy Headmistress McGonagall!”Seated to the left of Mr. Davis was another concerned parent, a whitehaired man in elegant black robes of unmatchable quality, one LuciusMalfoy, political leader of the strongest faction of the Wizengamot.To the left of Lord Malfoy, a sneeringly aristocratic man with a scarredface who had been introduced to them as Lord Jugson.Then an elderly but sharp-eyed fellow named Charles Nott, rumoredto be nearly as wealthy as Lord Malfoy, seated on Lord Jugson’s left.On the right of Mrs. Davis, one would find the comely Lady and yethandsomer Lord of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Greengrass.Young they were as wizards counted age, garbed in grey silken robes setwith tiny dark emeralds embroidered into the shape of grass blades. TheLady Greengrass was considered a key swing vote on the Wizengamot,her own mother having retired from the body with surprising speed. Hercharming husband, though his family was not noble or wealthy of itself,had taken a seat on the Hogwarts Board of Governors.To their right, a square-jawed and incredibly tough-looking old witch,who had shaken hands with Mr. and Mrs. Davis without the slightest hintof condescension. This was Amelia Bones, Director of the Department ofMagical Law Enforcement.To Amelia’s right was a seniorish woman who had set the fashionscene of magical Britain on its ear by integrating a live vulture into herhat, one Augusta Longbottom. Though she was not addressed as Lady,Madam Longbottom would exercise the full rights of the Longbottomfamily for so long as their last scion had yet to attain his majority, andshe was considered a prominent figure in a minority faction of theWizengamot.At the side of Madam Longbottom was seated none other than ChiefWarlock Supreme Mugwump Headmaster Albus Percival Wulfric BrianDumbledore, legendary defeater of Grindelwald, protector of Britain, rediscoverer of the fabled twelve uses of dragon’s blood, the most powerfulwizard in the world &c.And finally, on the far right, one would find the enigmatic DefenseProfessor of Hogwarts, Quirinus Quirrell, who was leaning back on thecushioned benches as though resting; seeming entirely and naturally atease in the rarefied company of a voting quorum of the Hogwarts Boardof Governors, which had dropped by on this fine Saturday to learn justwhat the Fiddly-Snocks had been going on at Hogwarts in general andwith Draco Malfoy, Theodore Nott, Daphne Greengrass, Susan Bones,and Neville Longbottom in particular. The name of Harry Potter had alsobeen much discussed.Oh, and one mustn’t forget Tracey Davis, of course. Director Bones’seyebrows had climbed in some interest upon hearing the young couple introduced as her parents. Lord Jugson had given them a brief, incredulousstare before dismissing them with a snort. Lucius Malfoy had greetedthem politely, his smile containing a hint of grim amusement mixed withpity.Mr. and Mrs. Davis, whose last vote on anything of significance hadbeen touching their wands to the name of Minister Fudge, who had allof three hundred Galleons stored in their Gringotts vault, and who respectively worked at selling cauldrons in a Potions shop and enchantingOmnioculars, were pressed up tightly against each other, sitting rigidlyerect upon their cushioned benches, and desperately wishing they’d wornnicer robes.The sky above was a solid mass of cloud dispersed into darker andlighter grays, grim with the promise of future storms; though no lightning flickered as yet, nor distant rumbles of thunder echoed; and only afew threatening droplets had fallen.To their designated starting place in a certain forest, the Sunshine Regiment marched, though it was really more like a slow walk; you wouldn’twant to tire yourself out before the battle even started, and the breezes ofApril were annoyingly humid, though cool. Ahead of them, a yellow flamewandered slowly through the air, guiding them according to their pace.Susan Bones kept throwing worried glances toward the SunshineGeneral as they marched through the grayly illuminated forest. Professor Snape’s going after Hermione seemed to have really shaken her.Hermione had even missed her Sunshine Regiment Official PlanningMeeting, which seemed understandable enough; but when Susan hadoffered her sympathy afterward, Hermione had stammered that she’dlost track of time, which wasn’t at all a usual thing for her to say, andthe girl had looked exhausted and frightened like she’d just spent threedays locked in a bathroom stall with a Dementor. Even now, when allthe Sunshine General’s focus should’ve been on the coming battle, theRavenclaw girl’s gaze was constantly darting in all directions, as thoughshe expected Dark Wizards to jump out of the bushes and sacrifice her.“The ban on Muggle artifacts cuts down our options a lot,” AnthonyGoldstein was saying in the dour tones the boy used to denote deliberate pessimism. “I had the idea of trying to Transfigure nets to throw onpeople, but—”“No good,” said Ernie Macmillan. The Hufflepuff boy shook his head,looking even more serious than Anthony. “I mean, it’s just like throwinga hex, they’d dodge.”Anthony nodded. “That’s what I figured, too. Do you have any ideas,Seamus?”The former Chaotic Lieutenant still looked a bit nervous and out-ofplace, marching along with his new comrades in the Sunshine Regiment.“Sorry,” said the newly minted Captain Finnigan. “I’m more the strategicmaster type.”“I’m the strategic master type,” said Ron Weasley, sounding put-off.“There are three armies,” the Sunshine General said acerbically,“which means we fight two armies at once, which means we need morethan one strategist, which means shut up, Ron!”Ron gave their General a surprised and worried look. “Hey,” the Gryffindor boy said in a calming tone, “you shouldn’t let Snape get to you somuch—”“What do you think we ought to do, General?” Susan said very loudlyand quickly. “I mean, we don’t really have a plan at this point.” Theirofficial planning session had failed amazingly with Hermione gone andboth Ron and Anthony thinking they were in charge.“Do we really need a plan?” the Sunshine General said, sounding alittle distracted. “We’ve got you and me and Lavender and Parvati andHannah and Daphne and Ron and Ernie and Anthony and Captain Finnigan.”“That—” began Anthony.“Sounds like a pretty good strategy,” Ron said with an approving nod.“We’ve got as many strong soldiers now as both other armies put together.Chaos’s only got Potter and Longbottom and Nott left—well, and Zabinitoo, I suppose—”“And Tracey,” said Hermione.Several people swallowed nervously.“Oh, stop it,” Susan said sharply. “She’s just a battle-hardened member of sphew, that’s all General Sunshine means.”“Still,” Ernie said, turning to look seriously at Susan, “I think you’dbetter go with whatever group fights Chaos, Captain Bones. I know youcan’t use your double magical powers except when innocents are in danger, but I mean—just in case Miss Davis does, you know, go out of controland try to eat someone’s soul—”“I can handle her,” Susan told him, keeping her voice reassuring. Admittedly, Susan hadn’t been replaced by a Metamorphmagus at the moment, but then Tracey probably wasn’t Polyjuiced Dumbledore or whoever.Captain Finnigan intoned in a deep, sort-of-rumbling voice, “I findyour lack of skepticism disturbing.” He raised his hand with his thumband forefinger almost touching, pointed at Ernie.For some reason Anthony Goldstein seemed to be having a suddenchoking fit. “What’s that supposed to mean?” said Ernie.“It’s just something General Potter says sometimes,” said CaptainFinnigan. “Funny, when you first join the Chaos Legion it all seems crazy,and then after a couple of months you realize that actually everyone whoisn’t in the Chaos Legion is crazy—”“I said,” Ron said loudly, “it sounds like good strategy. We don’tTransfigure anything, we don’t tire ourselves out, we handle whateverthey throw at us, and then we just overrun them.”“Okay,” said Hermione. “Let’s do that.”“But—” said Anthony, shooting a glare at Ron. “But General, HarryPotter’s got sixteen people left in his army. Dragon and us each havetwenty-eight. Harry knows that, he knows he’s got to come up withsomething incredible—”“Like what?” demanded Hermione, sounding stressed. “If we don’tknow what he’s planning, we might as well save our magic for doingmassed Finites. Like we should’ve done last time!”Susan touched Hermione gently on the shoulder. “General Granger?”said Susan. “I think you should take a break for a bit before the battle.”She’d been expecting Hermione to argue, but Hermione just noddedand then walked a little faster, pulling away from the Sunshine RegimentOfficial Officer Group, her eyes still watching the forest, and sometimesthe sky.Susan followed her. It wouldn’t do, having it look like the SunshineGeneral was being ejected from her own Official Officer Group.“Hermione?” Susan said softly, after they’d walked a bit away. “You’vegot to focus. Professor Quirrell’s in charge here, not Snape, and he won’tlet anything bad happen to you or anyone.”“You’re not helping,” Hermione said, sounding shaky. “You’re nothelping at all, Captain Bones.”The two of them walked faster, circling around some of the other soldiers, inspecting the marching perimeter and glancing at the surrounding trees.“Susan?” Hermione said in a small voice, when they’d gotten furtheraway from all the others. “Do you think Daphne’s right about Draco Malfoy plotting something?”“Yes,” Susan said at once, not even thinking about it. “You can tell,because his name’s got the letters M-A-L-F-O and Y in it.”Hermione looked around, as if to make sure that nobody was watching, although of course that was a wonderful way to get other people topay attention to you. “Could Malfoy have been behind what Snape did?”“Snape could be behind Malfoy,” Susan said thoughtfully, remembering dinner-table conversations she’d heard at Auntie’s, “or Lucius Malfoycould be behind both of them.” A slight chill went down Susan’s spine asthis last thought occurred to her. Suddenly, telling Hermione to just focus on the coming battle seemed a lot less reasonable. “Why, did you findsome sort of clue about that?”Hermione shook her head. “No,” the Ravenclaw girl said, in a voicethat sounded almost like she was about to cry. “I was—just thinkingabout it myself—that’s all.”In their designated place in a forest near Hogwarts, the Dragon Generaland the warriors of Dragon Army waited where their red flame had ledthem, beneath grey skies.At Draco’s right side stood Padma Patil, his second-in-command, whohad once led all of Dragon Army after Draco had been stunned. At Draco’sback was Vincent, the son of Crabbe, a family which had served the Malfoys into the distance of forgotten memory; the muscular boy was watchful as he was always watchful, whether battle had been declared or no.Further back, Gregory of the Goyles stood waiting beside one of the twobroomsticks Dragon Army had been given; if the Goyles had not servedthe Malfoys so long as the Crabbes, yet they had served no less well.And at Draco’s left side, now, stood one Dean Thomas of Gryffindor,a mudblood or possible half-blood who knew nothing of his father.Sending Dean Thomas to Dragon Army had been a quite deliberatemove on Harry’s part, Draco was certain. Three other former Chaoticshad also been transferred to Dragon Army, and all were watching Dracohawklike to see if he offered the former Lieutenant the slightest insult.Some might have called it sabotage, but Draco knew better. Harry hadalso sent Lieutenant Finnigan to the Sunshine Regiment, even thoughProfessor Quirrell’s mandate had only required that Harry give up oneLieutenant. That too had been a deliberate move, making crystal clearto everyone that Harry wasn’t dumping his least-favored soldiers.In one sense, it might have been easier for Draco to win the true loyalties of his new soldiers if they’d thought Harry hadn’t wanted them. In another sense… well, it wasn’t easy to put into words. Harry had given himgood soldiers with their pride intact, but it was more than that. Harryhad showed kindliness toward his soldiers, but it was more than that. Itwasn’t just Harry playing fair, it was something that… that you couldn’thelp but contrast with the way the game was played in Slytherin House.So Draco hadn’t offered the slightest insult to Mr. Thomas, butbrought him straight to his side, subordinate to himself and Padma butno one else. It was a test, Draco had told Mr. Thomas and everyone, nota promotion. Mr. Thomas would have to show himself worthy of rankwithin Dragon Army—but he would be given a chance, and the chancewould be fair. Mr. Thomas had looked surprised at the ceremony of it (theChaos Legion, from what Draco had heard, didn’t stand on formality)but the Gryffindor boy had stood a little straighter, and nodded.And then, after Mr. Thomas had done well enough in one of DragonArmy’s training sessions, he’d been brought into the strategy sessionin Dragon Army’s huge military office. And a few minutes into the session, Padma had happened to ask—as though it was a perfectly normalquestion—whether Mr. Thomas had any ideas about how to defeat theChaos Legion.The Gryffindor boy had said cheerfully that Harry had predicted thatGeneral Malfoy would get one of his soldiers to ask him that, and thatHarry had given him the message that General Malfoy should ask himselfwhere his relative advantage lay—what Draco Malfoy could do, or whatDragon Army could do, that the Chaos Legion couldn’t match—and thentry to exploit it for all it was worth. Dean Thomas couldn’t think of whatthat advantage might be, but if he did come up with any ideas for beatingChaos, he’d share them. Harry had ordered him to, after all.Sigh, Draco had thought, since he couldn’t actually sigh out loud. Butit was good advice, and Draco had followed it, sitting at his bedroom deskwith quill and parchment listing out everything that might be a relativeadvantage.And, almost to Draco’s own surprise, he’d had an idea, a real one. Infact he’d had two.The hollow bell sounded through the forest, somehow sounding moreominous than ever before. On the instant, the two pilots cried “Up!” andleapt onto their broomsticks, heading into the gray sky.Mr. and Mrs. Davis had now slumped slightly against each other, morefrom sheer muscle exhaustion than from any decrease of tension. Before them, the vast blank white parchment flickered with three great windows, as though holes had been cut through into the forest, showing threearmies on the march. Lesser windows showed the six riders upon theirbroomsticks, and the corner of the parchment showed a view of the entireforest, with glowing dots to indicate armies and scouts.The window into Sunshine showed General Granger and her Captains marching in the center of the Sunshine Regiment, protected byContego screens along with a number of other young witches. The Sunshine Regiment, the Defense Professor had remarked, knew well thatit had now acquired a strong advantage in experienced soldiers, andit meant to protect those soldiers from a surprise attack. Aside fromthat, the Sunshine Soldiers were moving forward at a steady march,conserving their strength.The soldiers in General Malfoy’s army, at least those with higherTransfiguration scores, were picking up leaves and Transfiguring theminto… well, if you looked at Padma Patil, who was almost done withhers, it looked like her leaf was becoming a left-handed glove bearing adangling strap. (The window had zoomed in to show this.)1231 *Lord Jugson was watching the screen with a flat expression; his voice,when he spoke, seemed to ooze and drip with disdain. “What is your sondoing, Lucius?”The foreign-born witch who stood at Draco Malfoy’s right side had finished Transfiguring her glove, and was now bringing it before the DragonGeneral like a sacrifice.“I do not know,” said Lucius Malfoy, his tone calm though no less aristocratic, “but I must trust that he has good reason for doing it.”All Dragon Army stopped for a moment as Padma slid the glove overher left hand, strapped it in place, and presented it before Draco Malfoy;who also stopped in place, took several deep breaths, raised his wand, executed a precise set of eight movements and bellowed “Colloportus!”The Dragon Warrior raised her gloved hand, flexed it, and gave asmall bow to Draco Malfoy, who returned it more shallowly, though theDragon General was staggering slightly. Padma then returned to herplace at Draco’s side, and the Dragons began marching once more.“Well,” remarked Augusta Longbottom. “I don’t suppose someonewould care to explain?” Amelia Bones was frowning slightly as she gazedat the screen.“For some reason or other,” said the amused voice of Professor Quirrell, “it seems that the scion of Malfoy is able to cast surprisingly strongmagic for a first-year student. Due to the purity of his blood, of course.Certainly the good Lord Malfoy would not have openly flouted the underage magic laws by arranging for his son to receive a wand before his acceptance into Hogwarts.”“I suggest you be careful in your implications, Quirrell,” Lucius Malfoysaid coldly.“Oh, I am,” Professor Quirrell said. “A Colloportus cannot be dispelledby Finite Incantatem; it requires an Alohomora of equal strength. Until then,a glove so Charmed will resist lesser material forces, deflect the Sleep Hexand the Stunning Hex. And as neither Mr. Potter nor Miss Granger cancast a counterspell powerful enough, that Charm is invincible upon thisbattlefield. It is not the original intent of the Charm, nor the intent ofwhoever taught Mr. Malfoy an emergency spell for evading his enemies.But it would seem that Mr. Malfoy has been learning creativity.”Lucius Malfoy had straightened as the Defense Professor spoke; henow sat erect upon his cushioned bench, his head held perceptibly higherthan before, and when he spoke it was with quiet pride. “He will be thegreatest Lord Malfoy that has yet lived.”“Faint praise,” Augusta Longbottom said under her breath; AmeliaBones chuckled, as did Mr. Davis for a tiny, fatal fraction of a second before he stopped with a strangled gargle.“I quite agree,” said Professor Quirrell, though it wasn’t clear to whomhe spoke. “Unfortunately for Mr. Malfoy, he is still new to the art of creativity, and so he has committed a classic error of Ravenclaw.”“And what might that be?” said Lucius Malfoy, his voice now turnedchill once more.Professor Quirrell had leaned back in his seat, the pale blue eyesbriefly unfocusing as one of the windows shifted its viewpoint withinthe greater screen, zooming in to show the sweat now on Draco Malfoy’sforehead. “It is such a beautiful idea that Mr. Malfoy has quite overlookedits pragmatic difficulties.”“Would someone care to explain that?” said Lady Greengrass. “Not allof us present are experts at such… affairs.”Amelia Bones spoke, the old witch’s voice somewhat dry. “It willtempt them to try to catch hexes that they would be wiser to simplydodge. The more so, if they have had little practice catching them. Andthe casting of so many Charms will tire their strongest warrior.”Professor Quirrell gave the DMLE Director a half-nod of acknowledgment. “As you say, Madam Bones. Mr. Malfoy is new to the business ofhaving ideas, and so when he has one, he becomes proud of himself forhaving it. He has not yet had enough ideas to unflinchingly discard thosethat are beautiful in some aspects and impractical in others; he has notyet acquired confidence in his own ability to think of better ideas as herequires them. What we are seeing here is not Mr. Malfoy’s best idea, Ifear, but rather his only idea.”Lord Malfoy simply turned to watch the screens again, as though theDefense Professor had used up his right to exist.“But—” said Lord Greengrass. “But what in Merlin’s name is HarryPotter—”Sixteen remaining soldiers of the Chaos Legion—or fifteen plus BlaiseZabini, rather—marched confidently through the forest, their shoesthudding over the still-dry ground. Their camouflage uniforms blendedinto the forest even more than usual, all colors washed out by the tints ofan overcast day.Sixteen Chaos Legionnaires, against twenty-eight Dragon Warriorsand twenty-eight Sunshine Soldiers.The common consensus had been that, with odds that bad, it was practically impossible for them to lose. After all, General Chaos was bound tocome up with something really spectacular, facing odds like that.There was something almost nightmarish about how everyoneseemed to now expect Harry to pull miracles out of his hat, on demand,any time one was needed. It meant that if you couldn’t do the impossible,you were disappointing your friends and failing to live up to your potential…Harry hadn’t bothered complaining to Professor Quirrell about ‘toomuch pressure’. Harry’s mental model of the Defense Professor had predicted him looking severely annoyed, saying things along the lines of Youare perfectly capable of solving this problem, Mr. Potter; did you even try? andthen deducting several hundred Quirrell points.From above, from where two broomsticks watched their march, thehigh young voice of Tess Walsh cried “Friend!” and after another moment, “Gingersnap!”A handful of seconds later, the soldier who’d code-named herself Gingersnap returned bearing a double handful of acorns, sweating slightlyin the cool but humid air from the jog that had taken her to the oak treeNeville had spotted. Gingersnap approached to where Shannon was holding a uniform-shirt with the neck tied off, in lieu of anyone having toTransfigure a bag. When Gingersnap brought her hands forward to tryand dump her acorns into the holding-shirt, Chaotic Shannon, giggling,jerked the shirt to the right, then to the left again as Gingersnap madeanother effort to dump the acorns, until a sharp “Miss Friedman!” fromLieutenant Nott caused Shannon to sigh and hold the shirt still. Gingersnap dumped her acorns into those accumulated, and then headed outfor more.Somewhere in the background, Ellie Knight was singing her very ownversion of the Chaos Legion’s marching song, and around half the othersoldiers were trying to step along with it despite not knowing the tunein advance. Nearby, Nita Berdine, who had a high Transfiguration score,finished creating yet another pair of green sunglasses, and handed themto Adam Beringer, who folded up the sunglasses before tucking them intohis uniform pocket. Other soldiers were already wearing their own greensunglasses, despite the cloudy day.You might guess that there was some sort of incredibly complicatedand fascinating explanation behind this, and you would be right.Two days earlier Harry had been sitting amid his bookcases in thecomfy rocking-chair he’d obtained for his trunk’s cavern level, pondering silently in the quiet span between classes and dinnertime, thinkingabout power.For sixteen Chaotics to defeat twenty-eight Sunnies and twenty-eightDragons they would need a force amplifier. There were limits to what youcould do with maneuver. There had to be a secret weapon and it had to beinvincible, or at least moderately unstoppable.Muggle artifacts were now illegal in Hogwarts’s mock battles, bannedby Ministry edict. And the trouble with finding some other clever andunusual spell was that an army twice your own size could brute-forceFinite almost anything you tried. The Sunshine Regiment might havemissed that tactic with the Transfigured chainmail, but nobody wouldmiss it again now that Professor Quirrell had pointed it out. And FiniteIncantatem was a brute-force counterspell which required at least as muchmagic as the spell being canceled… which, if you were severely outnumbered, made it a whole new order of military challenge. The enemy couldFinite anything you tried, and still have enough magic left over for shieldsand volleys of Sleep Hexes.Unless, somehow, you could invoke potencies beyond the ordinarystrength of first-year Hogwarts students, something too powerful for theenemy to Finite.So Harry had asked Neville if he’d ever heard of any small, safe sacrificial rituals—And then, after the screaming and the shouting had subsided, afterHarry had stopped trying to argue about Unbreakable Vows and justgiven up the whole thing as impossible from a public relations standpoint, Harry had realized that he hadn’t even needed to go there. Theytaught you how to invoke potencies far beyond your own strength inordinary Hogwarts classes.Sometimes, even though you were looking straight at something, youdidn’t realize what you were looking at until you happened to ask exactlythe right question.Defense. Charms. Transfiguration. Potions. History of Magic. Astronomy.Broomstick Flying. Herbology…“Foe!” screamed the voice from above.It was a good thing that Neville Longbottom hadn’t the tiniest idea thathis grandmother was watching; or he would’ve been more self-consciousabout screaming scary battlecries at the top of his lungs while casting Luminos every three seconds as he rocketed through a dense forest of trees,hot on the tail of Gregory Goyle.(“But—” Augusta Longbottom said, her expression showing almost asmuch astonishment as worry. “But Neville is afraid of heights!”)(“Not all fears last,” said Amelia Bones. The old witch was favoringthe great screen before them with a measuring gaze. “Or perhaps he hasfound courage. It is much the same, in the end.”)A glimmer of red—Neville dodged, very nearly into a tree but he did dodge; and thenNeville somehow also managed to dodge almost all of the branches beforethey smacked him in the face.Now Mr. Goyle’s broomstick was pulling further and further away—even though the two of them were riding exactly the same broomstick andMr. Goyle weighed more, somehow Neville was still falling behind. SoNeville slowed down, pulled back, angled up out of the forest and beganto accelerate back toward where the Chaos Legion still marched.Twenty seconds later—it hadn’t been a long chase, just an excitingone—Neville was back among his fellow Chaotics, and dismounted hisbroom to walk on the ground for a little bit.“Neville—” said General Potter. Harry’s voice was a little distant, ashe walked carefully and steadily through the forest, his wand still appliedto the almost-finished Form of the object he was slowly Transfiguring.Beside him, Blaise Zabini, working a smaller version of the same Transfiguration, looked like a shambling Inferi as he stumbled forward. “I toldyou—Neville—you don’t have to—”“Yes, I do,” said Neville. He looked down at where his fingers graspedthe broomstick, and saw that not just his hands, but his whole arms wereshaking. But unless anyone else in Chaos had been practicing duelingfor an hour a day with Mr. Diggory, and then practicing their aim in private for another hour afterward, Neville was probably the best shot froma broomstick even after taking into account that he wasn’t a very goodflyer.“Good show, Neville,” Theodore said from where he was walkingahead of them all, leading the Chaos Legion forward through the forestwhile wearing only his undershirt.(Augusta Longbottom and Charles Nott exchanged brief astonishedglances and then wrenched their gazes away from one another as thoughstung.)Neville took a few deep breaths, trying to steady his hands, tryingto think; Harry might not be good for deep strategic thinking while hewas in the middle of an extended Transfiguration. “Lieutenant Nott, doyou have any idea why Dragon Army just did that? They lost a broom—”The Dragons had started the combat with a feint to provide a distractionfor Mr. Goyle’s approach through the forest; Neville hadn’t realized therewere two brooms attacking until almost too late. But the Chaos Legionhad gotten the other pilot. That was why broomsticks usually didn’t attack before armies met, it meant a whole army would concentrate fire onthe broomstick. “And the Dragons didn’t even get anyone, did they?”“Nope!” Tracey Davis said proudly. She too was now marching byGeneral Potter’s side, her wand gripped low and watchful as her eyesscanned the surrounding forest. “I threw up a Prismatic Sphere like asplit second before Mr. Goyle’s hex got Zabini, and the way Mr. Goyle hadhis other arm stretched out I think he planned to knock down the General, too.” The Slytherin witch smiled with vicious confidence. “Mr. Goyletried a Breaking Drill Hex, but learned to his dismay that his weak magicwas no match for my newfound dark powers, hahahaha!”Some Chaotics laughed with her, but a queasy sensation was starting in Neville’s stomach as he realized how close the Chaos Legion hadcome to complete disaster. If Mr. Goyle had managed to disrupt bothTransfigurations—“Report!” snapped the Dragon General, doing his best to conceal the fatigue he felt after casting seventeen Locking Charms, with more yet tocome.Beads of sweat now dotted Gregory’s forehead. “The enemy got DylanVaughan,” Gregory said formally. “Harry Potter and Blaise Zabini wereeach Transfiguring something dark-grey and roundish, I don’t think itwas finished but it looked like it would be big and hollow, sort of cauldronshaped. Zabini’s was smaller than Potter’s. I couldn’t get either of themor disrupt their Transfigurations, Tracey Davis blocked me. Neville Longbottom is on a broomstick and he’s still a terrible flyer but his aim is reallygood.”Draco listened, frowning, and then he glanced at Padma and DeanThomas, who both shook their own heads, indicating that they alsocouldn’t think of what might be big and grey and shaped like a cauldron.“Anything else?” said Draco. If that was it, they’d lost a broom fornothing—“The only other weird thing I saw,” Gregory said, sounding puzzled,“was that some Chaotics were wearing… sort of like goggles?”Draco thought about this, not noticing that he’d stopped marching orthat all of Dragon Army had automatically stopped with him.“Was there anything special about the goggles?” Draco said.“Um…” Gregory said. “They were… greenish, maybe?”“Okay,” said Draco. Again without thinking, he began walking oncemore and his Dragons followed. “Here’s our new strategy. We’re only going to send eleven Dragons against the Chaos Legion, not fourteen. Thatshould be enough to beat them, now that we can neutralize their specialadvantage.” It was a gamble, but you had to take gambles sometimes, ifyou wanted to come in first in a three-way battle.“You figured out Chaos’s plan, General Malfoy?” said Mr. Thomaswith considerable surprise.“What are they doing?” said Padma.“I haven’t the faintest idea,” said Draco, with a smirk of the most refined smugness. “We’ll just do the obvious thing.”Harry, having now finished his cauldron, was carefully scooping acornsinto the container while the scouts searched for a nearby source of waterthat could be used as a liquid base. They’d come across frequent sinkholesand miniature creeks in the forest before, so it ought not to take long.Another scout had brought a straight stick that would serve as a stirrer,so Harry didn’t have to Transfigure one.Sometimes, even though you were looking straight at something, youdidn’t realize what you were looking at until you happened to ask exactlythe right question…How can I invoke magical powers that ought to be beyond the reach of firstyear students?There was a cautionary tale the Potions Master had told them (withmuch sneers and laughter to make the stupidity seem low-status insteadof daring and romantic) about a second-year witch in Beauxbatons who’dstolen some extremely restricted and expensive ingredients, and tried tobrew Polyjuiceso she could borrow the form of another girl for purposesbetter left unmentioned. Only she’d managed to contaminate the potionwith cat hairs, and then instead of seeking a healer immediately, the witchhad hidden herself in a bathroom, hoping the effects would just wear off;and when she’d finally been found, it had been too late to reverse thetransformation completely, condemning her to a life of despair as a sortof cat-girl hybrid.Harry hadn’t realized what that meant until the instant of thinkingthe right question—but what that implied was that a young wizard orwitch could do things with Potions-Making that they couldn’t even comeclose to doing with Charms. Polyjuice was one of the most potent potions known… but what made Polyjuice a N.E.W.T.-level potion, apparently, wasn’t the required age before you had enough magical power; itwas how difficult the potion was to brew precisely and what happened toyou if you screwed up.Nobody in any army had tried brewing any potions up until then. ButProfessor Quirrell would let you get away with nearly anything, if it wassomething you could also have done in a real war. Cheating is technique,the Defense Professor had once lectured them. Or rather, cheating is whatthe losers call technique, and will be worth extra Quirrell points when executedsuccessfully. In principle, there was nothing unrealistic about Transfiguring a couple of cauldrons and brewing potions out of whatever came tohand, if you had enough time before the armies met.So Harry had retrieved his copy of Magical Drafts and Potions, and begun looking for a safe but useful potion he could brew in the minutes before the battle started—a potion which would win the battle too fast forcounterspells, or produce spell effects too strong for first-years to Finite.Sometimes, even though you were looking straight at something, youdidn’t realize what you were looking at until you happened to ask exactlythe right question…What potion can I brew using only components gathered from an ordinaryforest?Every recipe in Magical Drafts and Potions used at least one ingredientfrom a magical plant or animal. Which was unfortunate, because all themagical plants and animals were in the Forbidden Forest, not the saferand lesser woods where battles were held.Someone else might have given up at that point.Harry had turned the pages from one recipe to another, skimmingfaster and faster in dawning realization, confirming what he had alreadyread and was now seeing for the first time.Every single Potions recipe seemed to demand at least one magicalingredient, but why should that be true?Charms required no material components at all; you just said thewords and waved your wand. Harry had been thinking about PotionsMaking as essentially analogous: Instead of your spoken syllables triggering a spell effect for no comprehensible reason, you collected a batchof disgusting ingredients and stirred four times clockwise, and thatarbitrarily triggered a spell effect.In which case, given that most potions used ordinary components likeporcupine quills or stewed slugs, you’d expect to see some potions usingonly ordinary components.But instead every single recipe in Magical Drafts and Potions demandedat least one component from a magical plant or animal—an ingredientlike silk from an Acromantula or petals from a Venus Fire Trap.Sometimes, even though you were looking straight at something, youdidn’t realize what you were looking at until you happened to ask exactlythe right question…If making a potion is like casting a Charm, why don’t I fall over from exhaustion after brewing a draught as powerful as boil-curing?The Friday before last, Harry’s double Potions class had brewed potionof boil-curing… although even the most trivial healing Charms, if you triedto cast them with wand and incantation, were at least fourth-year spells.And afterward, they’d all felt the way they usually felt after Potions class,namely, not magically exhausted to any discernible degree.Harry had shut his copy of Magical Drafts and Potions with a snap,and rushed down to the Ravenclaw common room. Harry had found aseventh-year Ravenclaw doing his N.E.W.T. potions homework and paidthe older boy a Sickle to borrow Moste Potente Potions for five minutes;because Harry hadn’t wanted to run all the way to the library to findconfirmation.After skimming through five recipes in the seventh-year book, Harryhad read the sixth recipe, for a potion of fire breathing, which required Ashwinder eggs… and the book warned that the resulting fire could be no hot*1241 *ter than the magical fire which had spawned the Ashwinder which hadlaid the eggs.Harry had shouted “Eureka!” right in the middle of the Ravenclawcommon room, and been severely rebuked by a nearby prefect, who’dthought Mr. Potter was trying to cast a spell. Nobody in the wizardingworld knew or cared about some ancient Muggle named Archimedes,nor the ur-physicist’s realization that the water displaced from a bathtubwould equal the volume of the object entering the bathtub…Conservation laws. They’d been the critical insight in more Mugglediscoveries than Harry could easily count. In Muggle technology youcouldn’t raise a feather one meter off the ground without the powercoming from somewhere. If you looked at molten lava spilling from avolcano and asked where the heat came from, a physicist would tell youabout radioactive heavy metals in the center of the Earth’s molten core.If you asked where the energy to power the radioactivity came from,the physicist would point to an era before the Earth had formed, and aprimordial supernova in the early days of the galaxy which had bakedatomic nuclei heavier than the natural limit, the supernova compressingprotons and neutrons into a tight unstable package that yielded backsome of the supernova’s energy when it split. A light bulb was fueled byelectricity, fueled by a nuclear power plant, fueled by a supernova… Youcould play the game all the way back to the Big Bang.Magic did not appear to work like this, to put it mildly. Magic’s attitude toward laws like Conservation of Energy was somewhere betweena giant extended middle finger, and a shrug of total indifference. Aguamenti created water out of nothingness, so far as anyone knew; there wasno known lake whose water level went down each time. That was a simplefifth-year spell, not considered impressive by wizards, because creatinga mere glass of water didn’t seem amazing to them. They didn’t have thewacky notion that mass ought to be conserved, or that creating a gramof mass was somehow equivalent to creating 90,000,000,000,000 joulesof energy. There was an upper-year spell Harry had run across whose literal incantation was ‘Arresto Momentum!’ and when Harry had asked if themomentum went anywhere else he’d just gotten a puzzled look. Harryhad kept an increasingly desperate eye out for some kind of conservationprinciple in magic, anywhere whatsoever……and the whole time it had been right in front of him in every Potions class. Potions-Making didn’t create magic, it preserved magic, thatwas why every potion needed at least one magical ingredient. And byfollowing instructions like ‘stir four times counterclockwise and onceclockwise’—Harry had hypothesized—you were doing something likecasting a small spell that reshaped the magic in the ingredients. (Andunbound the physical form so that ingredients like porcupine quillsdissolved smoothly into a drinkable liquid; Harry strongly suspected thata Muggle following exactly the same recipe would end up with nothingbut a spiny mess.) That was what Potions-Making really was, the artof transforming existing magical essences. So you were a little tiredafter Potions class, but not much, because you weren’t empowering thepotions yourself, you were just reshaping magic that was already there.And that was why a second-year witch could brew Polyjuice, or at leastget close.Harry had kept scanning through Moste Potente Potions, looking forsomething that might disprove his shiny new theory. After five minuteshe’d flipped the older boy another Sickle (over his protests) and kept going.The potion of giant strength required a Re’em to trample the mashedDugbogs you stirred into the potion. It was odd, Harry had realized after a moment, because crushed Dugbogs weren’t strong themselves, theywere just… very, very crushed after the Re’em got through with them.Another recipe said to ‘touch with forged bronze’, i.e., grasp a Knut inpliers so you could skim the potion’s surface; and if you dropped the Knutall the way in, the book warned, the potion would instantly superheat andboil over the cauldron.Harry had stared at the recipes and their warnings, forming a secondand stranger hypothesis. Of course it wouldn’t be as simple as PotionsMaking using magical potentials imbued in the ingredients, like Mugglecars fueled by the combustion potential of gasoline. Magic would neverbe as sensible as that…And then Harry had gone to Professor Flitwick—since he didn’t wantto approach Professor Snape outside of class—and Harry had told Pro* 1243 *fessor Flitwick that he wanted to invent a new potion, and he knew whatthe ingredients ought to be and what the potion should do, but he didn’tknow how to deduce the required stirring pattern—After Professor Flitwick had stopped screaming in horror and running in little circles, and Professor McGonagall had been called into theensuing fierce interrogation to promise Harry that in this case it was bothacceptable and important for him to reveal his underlying theory, it haddeveloped that Harry had not made an original magical discovery, but rediscovered a law so ancient that nobody knew who had first formulatedit:A potion spends that which is invested in the creation of its ingredients.The heat of goblin forges that had cast the bronze Knut, the Re‘em’sstrength that had crushed the Dugbogs, the magical fire that hadspawned the Ashwinder: all these potencies could be recalled, unlocked,and restructured by the spell-like process of stirring the ingredients inexact patterns.(From a Muggle standpoint it was just odd, a deranged version ofthermodynamics invented by someone who thought life ought to befair. From a Muggle standpoint, the heat expended in forging the Knuthadn’t gone into the bronze, the heat had left and dissipated into theenvironment, becoming permanently less available. Energy was conserved, could be neither created nor destroyed; entropy always increased.But wizards didn’t think that way: from their perspective, if you’d putsome amount of work into making a Knut, it stood to reason that youcould get exactly the same work back out. Harry had tried to explain whythis sounded a bit odd if you’d been raised by Muggles, and ProfessorMcGonagall had asked bemusedly why the Muggle perspective was anybetter than the wizarding one.)The fundamental principle of Potions-Making had no name and nostandard phrasing, since then you might be tempted to write it down.And someone who wasn’t wise enough to figure out the principlethemselves might read it.And they would start having all sorts of bright ideas for inventing newPotions.And then they would be turned into catgirls.It had been made very clear to Harry that he wasn’t going to be sharing this particular discovery with Neville, or Hermione either after thenext armies’ battle. Harry had tried to say something about Hermioneseeming really off lately and this being just the sort of thing that mightcheer her up. Professor McGonagall had said flatly that he wasn’t evento think it, and Professor Flitwick had raised his little hands and made agesture as of snapping a wand in half.Although the two Professors had been kind enough to suggest that ifMr. Potter thought he knew what the potion’s ingredients should be, hemight be able to find an already-existing recipe that did the same thing;and Professor Flitwick had mentioned several volumes in the Hogwartslibrary that might be useful…The vast parchment-like screen now showed only an aerial view of theforest, from which you could barely make out the camouflaged formsof three armies, split up into two groups each, converging to fight theirthree-way battle.The benches of the Quidditch stadium were now rapidly filling upwith the more easily bored sort of spectator who only wanted to be therefor the final battle and skip out on all the boring points along the way. (Ifthere was anything wrong with Professor Quirrell’s battles, it was widelyagreed, it was that his spectacles didn’t last nearly as long as Quidditchmatches, once they actually started. To this Professor Quirrell had repliedonly, Such is realism, and that had been that.)Within the huge window—it was all one window now, observing froma great height—the vague collections of tiny camouflaged forms grewcloser.Closer.Almost touching—The vast white parchment window showed the first touch of battle between Sunshine and Chaos, a screaming mass of running children withsmiley-faces upon their breasts, charging forward with Contego shieldsheld high and others shouting “Somnium!”—Until one of their number shrieked “Prismatis!” in a terrified voice andthe entire charge came to a sudden halt before the sparkling wall of forcethat had appeared in front of them.Tracey Davis had walked out from behind the trees.“That’s right,” said Tracey, her voice low and grim as she leveled herwand on the barrier. “You should fear me. For I am Tracey Davis, theDarke Lady! That’s Darke Lady spelled D-A-R-K-E, with an E!”(Amelia Bones, Director of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, was sending an inquiring look at Mr. and Mrs. Davis, both of whomlooked like they would have dearly preferred to die on the spot.)Behind the Prismatic Barrier, there was some kind of hushed argument taking place among the Sunshine Soldiers, one of whom in particular seemed to be getting scolded by several of the others.Then, a moment later, Tracey flinched.Susan Bones had come to the front of the Sunshine contingent.(“Goodness,” said Augusta Longbottom. “What do you suppose yourgrand-niece has been learning at Hogwarts?”)(“I don’t know,” Amelia Bones said calmly, “but I shall owl her a Chocolate Frog and instructions to learn more of it.”)The Prismatic Barrier vanished.The Sunshine Soldiers resumed their charge forward.Tracey yelled, her voice high with strain, “Inflammare!” and the Sunshine charge came to another sudden halt as a line of fire blazed up between them in the half-dry grass, extending to follow the path of Tracey’swand as she pointed it; an instant later Susan Bones cried “Finite Incantatem!” and the flames dimmed, brightened, dimmed in the contest oftheir wills, other soldiers raising their wards to aim at Tracey; and thatwas when Neville Longbottom plunged shrieking out of the sky.One of the Dragon Warriors, Raymond Arnold, made a hand-sign, pointing forward and oblique left; and there was a sudden hushed hiss of whispers among the Dragon Army contingent as they all quietly reorientedthemselves in the direction of the enemy. The Sunnies knew they werethere, of course both armies knew; but somehow, in this moment, theyhad all become instinctively quiet.The Dragons crept forward further, and then further, the dull camouflaged forms of the Sunnies beginning to appear among the distant trees,and still nobody spoke, nobody bellowed the call to charge.Draco was now at the forefront of his soldiers, Vincent behind himand Padma only a shade further back; if the three of them could take theshock of Sunshine’s best, the rest of Dragon Army might stand a chance.Then Draco saw one Sunnie staring at him from the distance, in thevanguard of her own army; staring at him with a look of fury—Across the forest battleground, their eyes met.Draco had only a fraction of a second to wonder, in the back of hismind, what Hermione Granger was so angry about, before the shoutwent up from both their armies; and they were all running forward tothe charge.The other Chaotics had appeared now from among the trees, some haddropped out of trees, and the battle was in full force now, everyone firing inevery direction at anything that looked like an enemy. Plus a number ofSunnies crying “Luminos!” at Neville Longbottom as the Chaos Hufflepufftwisted and rocketed up through the air on courses that could only bedescribed as, indeed, “chaotic”—And it happened, the way it happened only one time out of twenty inmock aerial combat, that Neville Longbottom’s broomstick glowed brightred beneath his clenched hands.It should’ve meant that Longbottom was out of the game.Then, in the Hogwarts stands, among the watching crowds of students, a scream went up—Combat realism. It was Professor Quirrell’s one master rule. You couldget away with anything if it was realistic, and in real life, a soldier didn’tjust vanish when their broomstick got hit by a curse.Neville was falling toward the ground and screaming “Chaotic landing!” and the Chaotics were wrenching their attention away from fightsto cast the Hover Charm (and run at the same time so they wouldn’t besitting ducks), almost everyone else stopping to gape—And Neville Longbottom slammed into the leaf-laden forest ground,landing on one knee, one foot, and both hands, as though he were kneeling down to be knighted.Everything stopped. Even Tracey and Susan paused in their duel.In the stadium, all crowd noises vanished.There was a universal silence composed of astonishment, concern,and sheer dumbstruck gaping awe, as everyone waited to see what wouldhappen next.And then Neville Longbottom slowly rose to his feet, and leveled hiswand at the Sunshine Soldiers.Though nobody on the battlefield heard it, a large segment of the stadium audience had begun chanting, in steadily rising notes each time theword was uttered, “DOOM DOOM DOOM DOOM DOOM”, because youjust couldn’t see that and not think it required musical accompaniment.“The crowd is cheering your grandson,” said Amelia Bones. The oldwitch was favoring the screen with a measuring look.“So they are,” said Augusta Longbottom. “Some, if I hear correctly,are cheering, Our blood for Neville! Our souls for Neville!”“Quite,” said Amelia, taking a sip from a teacup which had not beenthere moments earlier. “It shows the lad has leadership potential.”“These cheers,” continued Augusta, her voice taking on an even morestunned quality, “seem to be coming from the Hufflepuff benches.”“It is the House of the loyal, my dear,” said Amelia.“Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore! What in Merlin’s name hasbeen happening in this school?”Lucius Malfoy was watching the screens with an ironic smile, his fingers tapping at his armrest in no discernible pattern. “I do not know whatis more frightening, the thought that he has some hidden plan behind allthis, or the thought that he does not.”“Look!” cried the Lord of Greengrass. The dapper young man hadrisen half out of his chair, pointing his finger at the screen. “There shegoes!”“We’ll both take him at once,” Daphne whispered. She knew that a fewfear-filled minutes of real combat experience, a handful of times eachweek, might not be enough to match Neville’s regular dueling practicewith Harry and Cedric Diggory over the same period. “He’s too much forone of us, but both of us together—I’ll use my Charm, you just try to stunhim—”Hannah, beside her, nodded, and then they both screamed at the topof their lungs and charged forward, the Hover Charms of two supportingSunshine Soldiers moving them faster and making them light on theirfeet, Daphne already crying “Tonare!” even as Hannah kept a huge Contegoshield moving in front of them, and with a brief extra lift they leapt overthe heads of the front screen of soldiers and landed in front of Nevillewith their hair billowing high around them—(Photographs were strictly prohibited at all Hogwarts games, butsomehow this moment still ended up on the front page of the next day’sQuibbler.)—and in the same instant, because fighting older bullies had burnedaway the slightest traces of hesitation, Hannah fired her first Sleep Hex atNeville (she’d started the incantation while she was still in the air) even asDaphne, concentrating more on speed than on force, slashed down withher Ancient Blade at where she thought Neville’s thighs would be after hedodged—But Neville leapt up, not sideways, leapt up higher than he should’vebeen able to go, so that her glowing sword cut only the air beneath hisfeet. Somehow Daphne realized what it meant, that Neville still had otherChaotics Hovering him, in time for her to raise her Blade up over herhead, but Neville fell too fast and when his Blade smashed into hers it waslike being hit by a Bludger. It knocked Daphne off her feet and sent hersprawling backward onto the grass, hitting the ground hard on her back.It might have been all over for her, then, if Neville hadn’t landed too hardhimself and gone to his knees with a pained gasp. And then before Nevillecould bring his glowing Blade down, Hannah shouted “Somnium!” andNeville lurched frantically backward—though of course no spell had actually come from Hannah’s wand, the Hufflepuff girl couldn’t really havefired again that fast—which gave Daphne a second to scramble to her feetand get both hands around her wand again—“Dear Merlin,” said Lady Greengrass. Her voice seemed unsteady, thearistocratic poise well-punctured. “My daughter is fighting with theCharm of the Most Ancient Blade. In her first year. I never knew shepossessed—such extraordinary talent—”“Excellent blood,” Charles Nott said approvingly, causing Augusta tosnort.“My good Lady,” said Professor Quirrell, sounding grave. “Do notwrong your daughter so. That is not mere talent which you see.” Hisvoice grew a little dryer. “Rather, it is what happens when children puttheir competitive efforts into a game which involves actual spellcasting.”“Expelliarmus!” shouted Draco, trying not to let his voice crack as he simultaneously dodged the blazing red stunbolt that Hermione Granger hadfired at him, his muscles twisting with the need to dodge in the wrongdirection—she’d pointed to his left, and then with a mysterious twitchfired right—Hermione dodged the fast-moving dueling hex, and cried with hardlyanother moment’s pause, “Steleus!”, a wide-angle Hex that Draco couldn’tavoid, but he managed to point his wand at his own face and cry “Quiescus!” before the sudden urge to inhale could devolve into a sneezing fitthat would’ve ended the battle.Draco Malfoy was already half-exhausted from all the LockingCharms and Transfigurations earlier, but his confusion was beginning to give way to a sense of his own blood boiling, he didn’t know whyGranger was attacking him so angrily all of a sudden, but if she wanted afight he’d give her one—(The Dragons and Sunnies weren’t stopping to watch the duel of theirGenerals, the Dragons were too disciplined to stop and watch and thatmeant the Sunnies had to go on fighting too; but the gaping audience inthe Hogwarts Quidditch stands were being distracted even from Nevilleand Daphne’s spectacle, shifting their eyes to the duel of two Generals asMalfoy and Granger fired hex after hex and jinx after jinx at each other,casting more rapidly than any other student in their year could have managed, the Dragon General’s trained dueling dance matched by the Sunshine General’s frantic energy, the combat between them beginning toresemble an adult duel as the two most magically powerful first-years resorted to spells more exotic than the usual Sleep Hex.)—although, Draco was beginning to realize, when he and Harry andProfessor Quirrell had dismissed Miss Granger as having as much intentto kill as a bowl of wet grapes, they’d never seen her angry.Daphne lashed out with her Ancient Blade, again not trying to hit hardbut just moving the Blade as fast as possible, at the same time Hannahcried “Somnium!” and Neville leapt back again, but it had been anotherbluff and Hannah was moving in to fire a real spell almost point-blank——and Neville Longbottom did exactly what—he would explainafterward—Cedric Diggory had trained him to do if he was fightingBellatrix Black, which was to spin around and kick Hannah really hard inthe pit of her stomach.1251 *The Hufflepuff girl made a sad little sound, a gasping cry of pain, asshe was knocked off her feet by the hard shoe sinking into her abdomenwith the force of Neville’s whole body behind it.For an instant the battlefield stood still, everything halted except Hannah’s falling form.Then Neville’s face turned to absolute dismay and he lowered hiswand, the Chaotic Lieutenant starting instinctively toward his Housemate as he reached for her with his other hand—Even as Hannah turned her fall into a roll and came out with her wandraised and shot him.A fractional second later, Daphne, who hadn’t hesitated either, sankher Most Ancient Blade squarely into Neville’s back, causing the ChaoticLieutenant’s muscles to jerk convulsively with the stunning magic discharging into him even as Hannah’s Sleep Hex took effect, and then thelast scion of Longbottom was sprawled still on the ground with a look oftotal surprise frozen to his face.“Today Mr. Longbottom has learned a valuable lesson about his feelingsof pity and remorse,” said Professor Quirrell.“And chivalry,” said Amelia, sipping her tea again.“Are you all right?” whispered Daphne, as she stood protectively overwhere Hannah lay on the ground clutching her stomach. The girl didn’tgive anything back in reply except more retching sounds that soundedlike Hannah was trying not to throw up while trying not to cry.Somehow, even though it might not have been good tactics—itwould’ve been better if Hannah had been hexed outright, than for othersoldiers to be tied up protecting her—a number of Sunnies seemed to bestanding in front of Hannah with their wands clutched tightly, staringangrily at the Chaotics. Someone had thrown up a Prismatic barrierbetween the two groups, Daphne couldn’t see who.And for some reason the Chaotics didn’t seem to be pressing the attack. Even Tracey had completely dropped the grim look on her face andwas shifting her weight nervously from one foot to another, as thoughshe was having trouble remembering which side she was on—“Hold!” shouted a voice. “Hold battle!”There wasn’t much battle going on anyway, but it held.General Potter, looking every inch the Boy-Who-Lived, strode outfrom the trees with something large and camouflage-cloth-covered heldunder one arm.“Is Miss Abbott breathing all right?” General Potter yelled.Daphne didn’t look back. She didn’t trust that this wasn’t a trap—itwas absolutely certain that if the Chaotics took the opportunity to attack,Professor Quirrell would not only rule it legal but also award them extrapoints afterward. But Daphne could hear the answer well enough withher ears, it wasn’t like Hannah was trying to breathe quietly, and so shesaid, “Sort of.”“She should get out of here and to someone who can use healingCharms,” Harry said. “Just in case that broke something.”From behind Daphne, a small gasping voice said, “I—can—still—fight—”“Miss Abbott, don’t—” Harry said, just as there was the sound frombehind Daphne of someone collapsing back to the grass after trying andfailing to get to her feet. Everyone winced, but Daphne didn’t turn herback on Harry.“Why haven’t the teachers stopped the battle?” said Susan, her voiceangry.“I expect it’s because Miss Abbott is in no danger of permanent damage and Professor Quirrell thinks we’re learning valuable lessons,” Harrysaid in a hard voice. “Look, Miss Abbott, if you go, Tracey will also retirefrom the battle. You already outnumber us, so that’s a very good deal foryour side. Please take it.”“Hannah, just go!” said Daphne. “I mean, just say you’re out!”When Daphne glanced back she saw that Hannah was shaking herhead, still curled up in a ball on the grass.“Oh, screw this,” said Harry. “Chaotics! The faster we stun them, the fastershe’s out of here! We’re going to do this very quickly, even if we take casualties! Endtruce! TUNAFISH!”Daphne’s political hindbrain had only an instant to admire howHarry’s few words had just made the Chaotics the good guys, and thenin almost perfect unison, the Chaotics were plunging their hands intothe pockets of their uniforms and drawing out green sunglasses in anunfamiliar style. Not like anything you would wear to the beach, morelike goggles for advanced Potions—Then Daphne realized what was about to happen and snapped up herother hand to shield her eyes, just as Harry ripped the cloth off the cauldron.The fluid that spilled forth as Harry Potter threw the cauldron’s contents into the air was too bright to be seen, too brilliant to be imagined,incandescent like the Sun magnified a dozen times—(which was exactly what it was)(the sunlight which had been invested to create the acorns, the brightenergy that had fueled a tree rising up from the bare dirt)(blazing a searing purple, the color of the mixed blue and red wavelengths that chlorophyll absorbed)(with almost none of the green wavelengths that chlorophyll reflectedto create the green color of leaves)(which was the color of the Chaos Legion’s sunglasses, made to passthrough green wavelengths, blocking red and blue, reducing even themost incandescent purple glare to something bearable)—the violet light blazed on and on, Daphne tried dropping her armfrom her eyes but found that she couldn’t look directly at anything, eventhe secondhand purple glare was so bright she had to squint; and she hadonly time to cry one Finite Incantatem, which didn’t work, before a SleepHex took her.What was left of the battle didn’t take very long after that.“NOW!” bellowed Blaise Zabini, formerly of Sunshine, now commanding a detachment of Chaos Legionnaires. “I mean, TUNAFISH!” TheSlytherin boy’s hand grasped the cloth shielding the cauldron from thetriggering touch of daylight, already beginning to move it aside.“NOW!” bellowed Dean Thomas, formerly of Chaos, commanding aconsignment of Dragon Warriors. “DO WHATEVER THEY DO!”The Chaotics of Zabini’s detachment plunged their hands into theiruniform pockets, and came forth bearing green sunglasses——an action almost perfectly mirrored by Dean and the Dragon Warriors, who drew forth green-colored Potions goggles, and quickly drewthe straps over their own heads, even as the Chaotics put on their sunglasses and the violet incandescence blasted forth.(As General Malfoy had explained, if Mr. Goyle reported that theChaos Legion was wearing green-colored Potions goggles, you didn’thave to know why to Transfigure some copies.)“THAT’S CHEATING!” shrieked Blaise Zabini.“THAT’S TECHNIQUE!” Dean yelled back. “DRAGONS, CHARGE!”(“Pardon me,” the Lady Greengrass said. “Could you stop laughinglike that, Mr. Quirrell? It’s unnerving.”)“FINITE THEIR GOGGLES!” shouted Blaise Zabini, as the two armiesran headlong toward each other through omnipresent eye-searing purpleglare. “WE CAN STILL WIN!”“YOU HEARD HIM!” bellowed Dean. “GET THEIR GLASSES!”Blaise Zabini’s reply to this wasn’t anything articulate.That battle went on a lot longer.“Stupefy!” shrieked the Sunshine General.Draco didn’t dodge, he didn’t counter, he didn’t have enough energyleft for either, all he could do was whip his left hand into position andhope—The red stunbolt dissipated again on Draco’s Colloportused glove,which he’d Transfigured and spell-locked to his hand the same as the restof Dragon Army. It was all that was saving him now, that shield.It should have been a time to counterattack, but Draco could onlycatch his breath, as the two of them danced backward and forward beneath the trees in the never-ending movements of their duel. Across fromhim, General Granger was panting hard, the young girl’s face glisteningwith sweat like dew, her chestnut hair wetted into brown plaits. Her camouflage uniform was stained with damp spots, her shoulders visibly trembling with exhaustion, but her wand was still steel-steady where it stayedlevel on Draco through all their motion. Her eyes glaring, her cheeksflushed with rage.So, little girl, why’re you pretending to fight like a grownup today?The taunt came to mind, but he didn’t really think he needed Grangerany angrier; so instead Draco just said—though he could hear his ownvoice cracking—“Any reason you’re feeling mad at me, Granger?”The girl was gasping for breath herself, her own voice wobbling asshe spoke. “I know what you’re up to,” said Hermione Granger, her voicerising. “I know what you and Snape are up to, Malfoy, and I know who’sbehind it!”“Huh?” Draco said without even thinking about it.That only seemed to increase Granger’s fury, and her fingerswhitened on the wand she held leveled on him.And then Draco got it, and it boiled his own blood in his veins. Evenshe thought he was secretly plotting against her—“You too?” Draco yelled. “I helped you, you bucktoothed bint! You, you,you,”— stuttering past all the Dark curses that came to mind until hefound something he could actually cast at her—“DENSAUGEO!”But Granger flashed and whirled around the Tooth-Lengthening Hex,and then her own wand came around and leveled at almost point-blankrange, even as Draco brought up his left hand like a shield, placing themagic-locked glove between himself and whatever she was about to fire,and the Sunshine General’s own voice rose to a shriek audible across thewhole battleground—Time should have paused.But it didn’t.Instead the padlock clicked and fell off the glove.Just like that.Just like that.The screens showed it all very clearly, to the entire watching Hogwartsstadium.And the bone-dead-silent hush that fell over every bench in everybleacher said that everyone understood quite clearly what it meant,that the scion of House Malfoy had just had his magic overcome by aMuggleborn.Hermione Granger didn’t pause in her fight, gave no sign that sheeven knew what she’d done; instead her foot snapped out in a Mugglestyle kick that knocked Draco’s wand cleanly out of his hand, his shockedmind and body moving just a little too slowly. Draco dove after his wand,scrabbling frantically on the ground, but from behind him a girl’s cracking voice said “Somnium!” and Draco Malfoy fell and didn’t rise again.There was another moment of frozen silence. The Sunshine Generalwas wobbling on her feet, looking like she might faint.Then the Dragon Warriors screamed at the top of their lungs andcharged forward to avenge their fallen commander.Mr. and Mrs. Davis were shaking as they stood up from the comfortablechairs of the faculty Quidditch box; they couldn’t quite clutch each otherwhile walking, but they held hands tightly, pretending hard to be invisible.If they’d been children young enough for accidental magic they probablywould’ve spontaneously Disillusioned themselves.The elderly Charles Nott said nothing as he stood from his chair. Thescarred Lord Jugson said nothing, as he stood from his own chair.Lucius Malfoy said nothing as he stood.All three of them turned without pause and strode toward the stairwell of the elevated bleachers, moving in eerie unison like an Auror trio—“Lord Malfoy,” the Defense Professor said in mild tones. That manwas still seated in his own chair, looking upon his parchment-like screens,arms limp at his side, as though for some reason he didn’t feel like moving.The white-haired man halted just before reaching the exit archway,and the elderly man and the scarred man halted as well, flanking him.Lord Malfoy’s head turned, too slightly to be any form of acknowledgement, but in the Defense Professor’s direction.“Your son performed exceptionally well today,” said Professor Quirrell. “I must confess that I underestimated him. And he has earned hisarmy’s loyalty, as you have witnessed.” Still very mild, the Defense Professor’s voice. “Speaking as your son’s teacher, it is my opinion that he willnot benefit if you interfere in his—”Lord Malfoy and his compatriots vanished down the stairs.“A fine try, Quirinus,” Dumbledore said quietly. The old wizard’s faceshowed small lines of worry; he hadn’t risen from his own seat either, staring at the parchment screens as though they were still active. “Do youthink he will listen?”The Defense Professor’s shoulders twitched in a slight shrug, the onlymovement they’d shown since the battle ended.“Well,” said the Lady Greengrass, as she rose up and cracked herknuckles, stretching, her husband silent beside her. “I must say, that wasquite… interesting…”Amelia Bones had risen from her own cushioned seat without anyfuss. “Interesting indeed,” said Director Bones. “I do confess, I find myself disturbed by the skill with which those children were fighting oneanother.”“The skill?” Lord Greengrass said. “Their spells didn’t seem all thatimpressive to me. Except for Daphne’s, of course.”The old witch did not move her eyes from where she was gazing atthe Defense Professor’s balding head. “The Stunning Hex is not a firstyear spell, Lord Greengrass, but that is not the skill I had in mind. Theysupported each other with those simple spells, they reacted at speed tosurprises…” The Director of the DMLE paused, as though searching forwords that a mere civilian could understand. “In the midst of battle,” shesaid finally, “with spells flying in every direction… those children seemedquite at home.”“Indeed, Director Bones,” said the Defense Professor. “Some arts arebest begun in youth.”The old witch’s eyes narrowed. “You are readying them to become amilitary force, Professor. To what end?”“Now hold on!” interjected Lord Greengrass. “There’s plenty ofschools where they teach dueling in first year!”“Dueling?” said the Defense Professor. From behind it wasn’t visibleif the pale face was smiling. “That is nothing, Lord Greengrass, to whatmy students have learned. They have learned not to hesitate in the faceof ambushes and greater foes. They have learned to adapt when combatconditions change and change again. They have learned to protect theirallies, to protect more those who are more valuable, to abandon pieceswhich cannot be rescued. They have learned that to survive they mustfollow orders. Some have even learned a little creativity. Oh, no, LordGreengrass, these wizards will not hide in their manors and wait to beprotected, when the next threat comes. They will know that they knowhow to fight.”Augusta Longbottom loudly clapped her hands together three times.We won.It was the first thing Draco heard when he woke up on the battlefield, Padma telling him how his soldiers had rallied after he fell. How,thanks to the Dragon General’s foresight, Mr. Thomas had led his detachment to victory over Chaos. How General Potter had defeated the portion of the Sunshine Regiment that clashed with him. How Mr. Thomas’sDragon Warriors had rejoined the main body of soldiers bearing boththeir own goggles and the sunglasses of the defeated Chaotics. How, onlymoments later, General Potter’s remaining contingent had attacked bothother armies with a potion that emitted searing purple light. But Dragonhad held the numerical advantage over Sunshine and Chaos both, andenough sunglasses for their warriors; and so Padma had managed to leadher inherited army to victory.From the light in Padma’s eyes and her arrogant smile that wouldhave done proud to a Malfoy, she was expecting congratulations. Dracomanaged to grit out some form of praise from between his clenched teeth,and couldn’t have said afterward what it was. The foreign-born witch, itappeared, hadn’t any idea what’d happened, or what it meant.I lost.The Dragons trudged back to Hogwarts beneath gray skies, colddroplets landing heavy on Draco’s skin, one by one. While he’d beenstunned, it had begun, the long-promised rain finally beginning to fall.There was only one option left to Draco now. A forced move, as Mr. MacNair, who’d taught Draco chess, would have termed it. Harry Potterprobably wouldn’t like it, if he really was in love with Granger the wayeveryone said. But the forced move, as Mr. MacNair had defined it, wasone you needed to make if you wanted the game to continue at all.It kept on playing in Draco’s mind, over and over again, even as hewalked like an automaton through the massive portals of Hogwarts, sentaway Vincent and Gregory with two sharp words, and became alone within his private bedroom, sitting on his bed, staring at the wall abovehis desk. Filling his mind like a Dementor had locked him into the memory.The padlock on his glove clicking and falling away—Draco knew, he knew what he’d done wrong. He’d been so tired aftercasting twenty-seven Locking Charms for all the other Dragon Warriors.Less than a minute wasn’t enough time to recover after each spell. And sohe’d just cast Colloportus on his own padlocked glove, just cast the spell, notput in all his strength to bind it stronger than Harry Potter or HermioneGranger could undo.But nobody was going to believe that, even if it was true. Even inSlytherin, nobody would believe that. It sounded like an excuse, and anexcuse was all that anyone would hear.Granger whirled and spun and screamed ‘ALOHOMORA!’—Draco’s mind kept playing it over and over as the resentment built.He’d helped Granger—cooperated with her on banning traitors—heldher hand as she’d dangled off the roof—stopped a riot from breaking outaround her in the Great Hall—did she have any idea what he’d risked,what he’d probably already lost, what it meant for the heir of HouseMalfoy to do that for a mudblood—And now there was only one move left, and the thing about a forcedmove was that you had to make it, even if it meant getting detention and losing House points. Professor Snape would know and understand, butthere were limits (Father had warned him) to what the Potions Masterwould overlook.Challenge Granger to a wizard’s duel, in open defiance of Hogwartsregulations. Attack her outright, if she tried to refuse. Defeat her one-onone, in public, not with clever dueling technique, but by overpowering hermagic. Beat her solidly, completely, crush her as utterly as the Dark Lordhimself had crushed his enemies. Make it absolutely clear to everyone,so that nobody could possibly doubt, that Draco had just been exhaustedfrom casting the spell so many times. Prove that the Malfoy blood wasstronger than any mudblood’s—Only it’s not, Harry Potter’s voice whispered inside Draco’s mind. It’seasy to forget what’s really true, Draco, once you start trying to win at politics. Butin reality there’s only one thing that makes you a wizard, remember?Draco knew, then, he knew the reason for the disquiet in the back ofhis mind, as he stared at the blank wall above his desk contemplating hisforced move. It should’ve been simple—when you only had one move, thething to do was make it—but—Granger whirling, spinning, sweat-dampened hair flying around her, boltsflying from her wand as fast as his own, jinx and counter-jinx, glowing bats flyingat his face, and through all of it the look of fury in Granger’s eyes—There’d been a part of him admiring that, before it had all gone wrong,admiring Granger’s fury and power; a part of him that had exulted in thefirst real fight he’d ever been in, against……an equal opponent.If he challenged Granger, and lost…It ought not to be possible, Draco had gotten his wand two full yearsbefore anyone else in his Hogwarts class.1261 *Only there was a reason why they usually didn’t bother giving wandsto nine-year-olds. Age counted too, it wasn’t just how long you’d held awand. Granger’s birthday had been only a few days into the year, whenHarry had bought her that pouch. That meant she was twelve now, thatshe’d been twelve almost since the start of Hogwarts. And the truth was,Draco hadn’t been practicing much outside of class, probably not nearlyas much as Hermione Granger of Ravenclaw. Draco hadn’t thought heneeded any more practice to stay ahead…And Granger was exhausted too, whispered the Voice of Contrary Evidence inside him. Granger must have been exhausted from all those Stunning Hexes, and even in that state she’d been able to undo his LockingCharm.And Draco could not afford to challenge Granger publicly, one-on-onewith no excuses, and lose.Draco knew what you were supposed to do in this sort of situation.You were supposed to cheat. But if anyone discovered Draco cheating,it would be disastrous, perfect blackmail material even if it never got outpublicly, and any Slytherins watching would know that, they’d be looking…And then, if you were watching, you would have seen Draco Malfoyget up from his bed, and go to his desk, and take out a sheet of the finestsheepskin parchment, and a pearl-carven inkwell, filled with greenishsilver ink that had been made with true silver and crushed emeralds.From the great trunk at his bed’s foot, the Slytherin drew forth a bookbound also in silver and emeralds, entitled The Etiquette of the Housesof Britain. And with a new, clean quill, Draco Malfoy began to write,frequently looking to the book where it lay open as a reference. Therewas a grim smile on the boy’s face, making the young Malfoy look verymuch like his father, as he carefully drew each letter as though it were aseparate artwork.From Draco, son of Lucius son of Abraxis Lords of the Noble and MostAncient House of Malfoy, son also of Narcissa daughter of Druella Ladyof the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black, scion and heir of the Nobleand Most Ancient House of Malfoy:To Hermione, the first Granger:(That form might have been meant to sound polite, long ago when ithad been invented; nowadays, after centuries of being used to addressmudbloods, it carried a lovely tinge of refined venom.)I, Draco, of Most Ancient House, demand redress, forDraco paused, carefully moving the quill aside so that it wouldn’t drip.He needed a pretext for this, at least if he wanted to impose the duel’s conditions. The challenged had the choice of terms unless they had insulted aNoble House. He needed to make it look like Granger had insulted him…What was he thinking? Granger had insulted him.Draco flipped the book to the page of standard formulae, and foundone that seemed appropriate.I, Draco, of Most Ancient House, demand redress, for that I have thriceover helped you and offered you only my goodwill, and in return youfalsely accused me of plotting against you,Draco had to stop and take a breath, forcing down the seething anger;he was starting to genuinely feel the insult now, and he’d just written outthe last phrase and underlined it without thinking, like it was an ordinaryletter. After a moment’s reflection, he decided to let it stand; it might notbe the exact formal phrasing but it had a raw, angry tone that seemedappropriate.which insult you committed before the eyes of Britain.Thus I, Draco, compel you, Hermione, by custom, by law, by“The seventeenth ruling of the thirty-first Wizengamot,” Draco saidaloud without looking, a line delivered in many plays; he sat straighter ashe said it, feeling every pulse of the noble blood in his veins.Thus I, Draco, compel you, Hermione, by custom, by law, by the 17thruling of the 31st Wizengamot, to meet me in wizard’s duel with terms:That we each come alone and in silence, speaking to none before or after,If the duel went poorly, Draco could just say nothing and leave it atthat. And if he did defeat Granger, he would have learned experimentallythat he could beat her again in a public challenge. It wasn’t cheating, butit was Science, which was almost as good.contesting by magic solely, without death or lasting injury,…where? Draco had been told about a room in Hogwarts that wasgood for duels, where everything valuable was already protected bywards, and there were no portraits to tattle on you… which one had itbeen again…in the trophy room of the Castle of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft andWizardry,And their second and public duel had better be soon, like tomorrow,it would take very little time for his reputation in Slytherin to go irretrievably to sludge. He needed to fight Granger for the first time tonight.upon midnight’s stroke that shall end this very day.Draco, of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy.Draco signed the formal parchment, and then drew forth his ordinaryand lesser parchment, and his regular ink, for his post scriptum:If you don’t know how the rules work, Granger, here’s how it is. You insulted a Most Ancient House, and I’ve got the lawful right to challenge.And if you affront the conditions of the duel, like by having Flitwick showup at the trophy room, or even just telling anyone else, my father will takeyou and your false honor straight to the Wizengamot.Draco MalfoOn the last letter his quill pressed down on the parchment so viciouslythat the nib snapped off, creating a streak of ink and a small rip in theparchment, which Draco decided also looked appropriate.That night at dinnertime, Susan Bones came to Harry Potter and told himthat she thought Draco Malfoy was going to carry out his plot against Hermione very soon. She was warning all the members of sphew, and she’dwarned Professor Sprout, and she’d warned Professor Flitwick, and shewas going to send a letter to her Aunt tonight, and now she was warningHarry Potter, too. Only they couldn’t quite talk about it with Padma—Susan said, looking very serious—because Padma was feeling torn between her loyalty to Hermione and her loyalty to her General.Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, who was at this point feelingmore frustrated with the entire situation than anything really productive,snapped at her that yes, he knew something had to be done.After Susan Bones left, Harry looked over at the other end of theRavenclaw table, where Hermione had sat down away from him orPadma or Anthony or any of her other friends.But Hermione didn’t look like she was in a mood where somebodygoing over and bothering her would be taken very well.Later, looking backward, Harry would think of how, in his SF and fantasy novels, people always made their big, important choices for big, important reasons. Hari Seldon had created his Foundation to rebuild theashes of the Galactic Empire, not because he would look more importantif he could be in charge of his own research group. Raistlin Majere hadsevered ties with his brother because he wanted to become a god, notbecause he was incompetent at personal relationships and unwilling toask for advice on how to do better. Frodo Baggins had taken the Ringbecause he was a hero who wanted to save Middle-Earth, not because itwould’ve been too awkward not to. If anyone ever wrote a true historyof the world—not that anyone ever could or would—probably 97% of allthe key moments of Fate would turn out to be constructed of lies and tissue paper and trivial little thoughts that somebody could’ve just as easilythought differently.Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres looked at Hermione Granger,where she’d sat down at the other end of the table, and felt a sense ofreluctance to bother her when she looked like she was already in a badmood.So then Harry thought that it probably made more sense to talk toDraco Malfoy first, just so that he could absolutely positively definitelyassure Hermione that Draco really wasn’t plotting against her.And later on after dinner, when Harry went down to the Slytherinbasement and was told by Vincent that the boss ain’t to be disturbed… thenHarry thought that maybe he should see if Hermione would talk to himright away. That he should just get started on unraveling the whole messbefore it raveled any further. Harry wondered if he might just be procrastinating, if his mind had just found a clever excuse to put off somethingunenjoyable-but-necessary.He actually thought that.And then Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres decided that he’d just talkto Draco Malfoy the next morning instead, after Sunday breakfast, andthen talk to Hermione.Human beings did that sort of thing all the time.It was Sunday morning, on the 5th of April, 1992, and the simulated skyabove the Great Hall of Hogwarts showed great torrents of rain pouring down in such density that the lightning flashes were diminished andscattered into small pulses of white light that sometimes transformedthe House tables, paling their faces and making all the students appearbriefly to be ghosts.Harry sat at the Ravenclaw table, wearily eating a waffle, waiting forDraco to make an appearance so that he could get started on sorting thiswhole thing out. There was a Quibbler being passed around which hadsomehow ended up with Hannah and Daphne on the front page, but ithadn’t gotten to his place yet.A few minutes later Harry finished eating his waffle, and then lookedaround again to see if Draco had arrived yet for breakfast at the Slytherintable.It was odd.Draco Malfoy was almost never late.Since Harry was looking in the direction of the Slytherin table, hedidn’t see Hermione Granger entering through the huge doors of theGreat Hall. Thus he was rather startled when he turned back and discovered Hermione sitting down directly beside him at the Ravenclaw table,just as if she hadn’t not-done that for more than a week.“Hi, Harry,” Hermione said, her voice sounding almost exactly normal. She started to put toast on her plate and a selection of healthy fruitsand vegetables. “How are you?”“Within one standard deviation of my own peculiar little average,”Harry automatically replied. “How are you doing? Did you sleep okay?”There were dark bags under Hermione Granger’s eyes.“Why, yes, I’m fine,” said Hermione Granger.“Um,” Harry said. He took a slice of pie onto his plate (as his brain wasoccupied with other things, Harry’s hand simply took the tastiest thingwithin range, without evaluating complex concepts like whether he wasready to eat dessert). “Um, Hermione, I’m going to need to talk to youlater today, is that okay?”“Sure,” said Hermione. “Why wouldn’t it be?”“Because—” Harry said. “I mean—you and I haven’t—for the last fewdays—”Shut up, suggested an internal part of Harry that seemed to have beenrecently allocated for governing Hermione-related issues.Hermione Granger didn’t look like she was paying much attention tohim in any case. She just stared down at her plate, and then, after aboutten seconds of awkward silence, began to eat her tomato slices, one afteranother, without pause.Harry looked away from her and began to eat a slice of pie which, hediscovered, had somehow materialized on his plate.“So!” Hermione Granger suddenly said after she’d polished off mostof her plate in silence. “Anything happening today?”“Um…” Harry said. He looked around frantically, as though to findsomething-happening that he could use as conversational fodder.And so Harry was one of the first to see it, and wordlessly point, although the sudden swell of whispers that swept through the Great Hallshowed that a number of other people had seen it too.The distinctive crimson tinge of the robes would have been recognizable anywhere, but it still took Harry’s brain a few moments to place thefaces. An Asianish-looking man, solemn, and today looking rather grim.A man with a piercing gaze that swept over the room, his long black hairwaving behind him in a ponytail. A man thin and pale and unshaven, witha face so blank that it was like stone. It took Harry a few moment to placethe faces, and remember the names, from that long-ago day in Januarywhen the Dementor had come to Hogwarts: Komodo, Butnaru, Goryanof.“An Auror trio?” Hermione said in a strange bright voice. “Why, Iwonder what they’d be doing here.”Dumbledore was in their company as well, looking as worried asHarry had ever seen him; and after a moment’s pause while the oldwizard’s eyes scanned the Great Hall and the students whispering overtheir breakfasts, he pointed——straight at Harry.“Oh, now what,” Harry said under his breath. His inward thoughtswere a lot more panicked than that, as he wondered frantically if anyonehad connected him to the Azkaban breakout somehow. He looked at theHead Table, trying to make the glance casual, and realized that ProfessorQuirrell was nowhere to be seen, this morning—The Aurors swept toward him with swift strides, Auror Goryanof approaching from the other side of the Ravenclaw table as though to blockany escape in that direction, Auror Komodo and Auror Butnaru approaching from Harry’s side, the Headmaster following straight on Komodo’sheels.All conversation everywhere had ground to utter silence.The Aurors reached Harry’s place at the table, surrounding him fromthree angles.“Yes?” Harry said, as normally as he could. “What is it?”“Hermione Granger,” Auror Komodo said in a toneless voice, “you areunder arrest for the attempted murder of Draco Malfoy.”he words dropped into Harry’s consciousness and shattered histhoughts into a hundred shards of incredulity, the shock ofadrenaline running into so much confusion that—“She—” Harry said. “She—she wouldn’t—WHAT?”The Aurors weren’t paying any attention to him. Komodo spokeagain, still in that colorless voice. “Mr. Malfoy has regained consciousness in St. Mungo’s and named you, Hermione Granger, as his assaulter.He has repeated these accusations under two drops of Veritaserum. TheBlood-Cooling Charm you cast upon Mr. Malfoy would have killed himif he had not been found and treated, and it must be presumed knownto you that this was a fatal curse. I therefore arrest you upon the seriouscharge of attempted murder and you will be taken into Ministry custodyto be interrogated under three drops of Veritaserum—”“Are you mad?” the words burst out of Harry’s mouth, as he shovedhimself up from the Ravenclaw table, an instant before Auror Butnaru’shand clamped down hard upon his shoulder. Harry ignored it. “That’sHermione Granger you’re trying to arrest, the nicest girl in Ravenclaw, shehelps Hufflepuffs with their homework, she’d die before she tried to killanyone—”Hermione Granger’s face had crumpled. “I did it,” she whispered in atiny voice. “It was me.”Another huge rock fell on Harry’s thoughts and crushed their fragileorder, bursting fragments of comprehension into dust.1271 *Dumbledore’s face seemed to have aged decades over the course ofseconds. “Why, Miss Granger?” Dumbledore said, his own voice barelyabove a whisper. “Why would you do such a thing?”“I’m,” Hermione said, “I’m, I’m—sorry—I don’t know why I—” Sheseemed to collapse in on herself, her voice was formed of nothing butsobs, and the only words that could be made out were, “I thought—killedhim—sorry—”And Harry should have said something, should have done something,should have jumped up out of his seat and stunned all three Aurors andthen gone on to some incredibly clever next move, but the twice-shatteredfragments of his thought processes could yield no output. Butnaru’s handpushed Harry gently but firmly back into his seat and Harry found himself stuck there like he’d been glued, he tried to grab his wand for a Finiteand it wouldn’t come out of his pocket, the three Aurors and Dumbledoreescorted Hermione out of the Great Hall amid a rising storm of outcriesand the doors began to swing shut behind them—nothing made sense,it was surreal beyond all reckoning, like he’d been transported into an alternate universe, and then Harry’s mind flashed back to another day ofconfusion and in a moment of desperate inspiration he finally realizedwhat the Weasley twins had done to Rita Skeeter, and his voice rose in ascream, “HERMIONE YOU DIDN’T DO IT YOU’VE BEEN FALSE-MEMORYCHARMED!”But the doors had already shut.Minerva couldn’t possibly have stood still, she paced back and forththrough the Headmaster’s office, the back of her mind half-expectingSeverus or Harry to tell her to shut up and sit down, but neither thePotions Master or the Boy-Who-Lived seemed much concerned with her,both of their gazes focused on Albus Dumbledore where he had emergedfrom the Floo. There were sounds in the background that nobody heard.Severus seemed as passionless as ever, sitting in a small cushioned chairbeside the Headmaster’s desk. The old wizard stood terrible and uprightby the still-burning fireplace, robed in black like a starless night, radiating power and dismay. All her own thoughts were of utter confusion andhorror. Harry Potter sat on a wooden stool with his fingers gripping theseat, and his eyes were fury and freezing ice.At 6:33am, Quirinus Quirrell had Flooed St. Mungo’s from his officefor immediate pickup of Draco Malfoy. Professor Quirrell had foundMr. Malfoy in the trophy room of Hogwarts, on the verge of death fromthe continuing effects of the Blood-Cooling Charm slowly lowering hisbody temperature. Professor Quirrell had immediately dispelled theCharm, cast stabilizing spells on Mr. Malfoy, and levitated him to hisoffice to Floo him to St. Mungo’s for further treatment. After this, Professor Quirrell had informed the Headmaster, stating the facts brieflybefore vanishing through the Floo; the Aurors, notified by St. Mungo’s,had demanded his presence for questioning.The clear intent of the Blood-Cooling Charm had been to kill DracoMalfoy so slowly that the wards of Hogwarts, set to detect sudden injury,would not trigger. Under interrogation, Professor Quirrell had told theAurors that he had cast several tracking Charms upon Mr. Malfoy’s person in January, shortly after Mr. Malfoy’s return to Hogwarts from Yuletime break. Professor Quirrell had cast tracking Charms because he hadlearned of a person with a motive to harm Mr. Malfoy. Professor Quirrellhad refused to identify this person. The tracking Charms which ProfessorQuirrell had cast were triggered by Mr. Malfoy’s health falling below anabsolute level, rather than by sudden changes, and had therefore alertedProfessor Quirrell before Mr. Malfoy had died.Two drops of Veritaserum, sufficient to prevent Mr. Malfoy fromwithholding any meliorating or moderating information in his statements, had shown that Mr. Malfoy had—legally under the laws of NobleHouses, illegally under the regulations of Hogwarts—challenged Hermione Granger to a duel. Mr. Malfoy had won the duel but had then, as heleft, been attacked from behind by Miss Granger with a Stunning Hex.After this Mr. Malfoy knew nothing.Three drops of Veritaserum, requiring her to volunteer all relevantinformation, had caused Hermione Granger to confess that she hadstunned Draco Malfoy from behind, and then, in a fit of anger, cast theBlood-Cooling Charm on him, with the deliberate intention of killinghim slowly enough to evade identification from the Hogwarts wards,whose workings she had read about in Hogwarts: A History. She had beenhorrified at herself upon awakening the next morning, but had not toldanyone of what she’d done, believing Draco Malfoy to be already dead—as he certainly would have been after seven hours, had his body’s ownmagic not been resisting the effects of the Blood-Cooling Charm.“Her trial,” said Albus Dumbledore, “is set for tomorrow at noon.”“What?” the word burst out of Harry Potter. The Boy-Who-Liveddidn’t rise from his chair, but Minerva saw his fingers whiten where theygripped the wooden seat beneath him. “That’s insane! You can’t do apolice investigation in one day—”The Potions Master raised his voice. “This is not Muggle Britain,Mr. Potter!” Severus’s face was as expressionless as ever, but the bite inhis voice was sharp. “The Aurors have an accusation under Veritaserumand a confession under Veritaserum. So far as they are concerned, theinvestigation is done.”“Not quite,” said Dumbledore, just as Harry seemed ready to explode.“I have insisted to Amelia that this matter be given the utmost scrutiny.Unfortunately, as the ill-fated duel was at midnight—”“Supposed duel,” Harry said sharply.“As the supposed duel was at midnight—yes, you’re quite right, Harry—it is beyond the range of any Time-Turner—”“Also supposedly,” the Boy-Who-Lived said coldly. “And rather suspiciously, since the alleged murder suspect doesn’t know about TimeTurners. I hope that an invisible Auror was immediately sent back intime as far as possible to observe—”Dumbledore inclined his head. “I went myself, Harry, the moment Iheard. But by the time I reached the trophy room, Mr. Malfoy was alreadyunconscious and Miss Granger had gone—”“No,” said Harry Potter. “You reached the trophy room and saw Dracounconscious. That is all you observed, Headmaster. You did not observeHermione there, or watch her leave. Let us distinguish observation frominference.” The boy’s head turned to look at her. “Imperius, Obliviation,False Memory Charm, Legilimency. Professor McGonagall, am I leavingout any mind-affecting spell that could have made Hermione do this ormake her believe she’d done it?”“The Confundus Charm,” she said. And the Dark Arts had never beenher study, but she knew—“And certain Dark rituals. But none of thosecould be performed in Hogwarts without alarm.”The boy nodded, his eyes still directly addressing her. “Which of thosespells can be detected? Which would the Aurors try to detect?”“The Confundus Charm would wear off in a few hours,” she said, after a moment to gather her thoughts. “Miss Granger would rememberthe Imperius. Obliviation cannot be detected by any known means, butonly a Professor could have cast that spell upon a student without alarmfrom the Hogwarts wards. Legilimency—can only be detected by anotherLegilimens, I think—”“I requested that Miss Granger be examined by the court Legilimens,”said Dumbledore. “The examination showed—”“Do we trust him?” said Harry.“Her,” said Dumbledore. “Sophie McJorgenson, whom I rememberas an honest student of Ravenclaw, and she is bound by the UnbreakableVow to tell the truth of what she sees—”“Could someone else be Polyjuiced as her?” Harry Potter interruptedagain. “What did you observe, Headmaster?”Albus said heavily, “A person who looked like Madam McJorgensontold us that a single Legilimens had lightly touched Miss Granger’s mindsome months ago. That is from January, Harry, when I communicatedwith Miss Granger about the matter of a certain Dementor. That wasexpected; but what I did not expect was the rest of what Sophie found.”The old wizard turned to gaze into the Floo fire, letting the orange flamesreflect on his face. “As you say, Harry, a False Memory Charm is onepossibility; they are, when cast perfectly, indistinguishable from truememory—”“That doesn’t surprise me,” Harry interrupted. “Studies show thathuman memories are more or less rewritten every time we rememberthem—”“Harry,” Minerva said softly, and the boy’s mouth clamped shut.The old wizard continued. “—but a False Memory Charm of such quality requires as much time to create as a true memory. Creating a detailedmemory of ten minutes would be ten minutes’ work. And according tothe court Legilimens,” Albus’s face now seemed more tired and lined thanbefore, “Miss Granger has been obsessing over Mr. Malfoy since the daythat Severus… yelled at her. She has been thinking of how Mr. Malfoymight be in league with Professor Snape, how he might be planning toharm her and harm Harry—imagining it for hours every day—it wouldbe impossible to create false memories for so much time.”“The appearance of insanity…” Severus murmured softly, as thoughhe were speaking to himself. “Could it be natural? No, it is too disastrousto be pure accident; too convenient for someone, I have no doubt. A Muggle drug, perhaps? But that would not be enough—Miss Granger’s madness would have to be guided—”“Ah!” Harry said suddenly. “I get it now. The first False MemoryCharm was cast on Hermione after Professor Snape yelled at her, andshowed, say, Draco and Professor Snape plotting to kill her. Then lastnight that False Memory was removed by Obliviation, leaving behind thememories of her obsessing about Draco for no apparent reason, at thesame time she and Draco were given false memories of the duel.”Minerva blinked in startlement. It would have been a thousand yearsbefore she thought of that possibility.The Potions Master was frowning thoughtfully, eyes intent. “The reaction to a False Memory Charm is hard to predict in advance, Mr. Potter,without Legilimency. The subjects do not always act as expected, whenthey first remember the false memories. It would have been a risky ploy.But I suppose that is one way Professor Quirrell could have done it.”“Professor Quirrell?” said Harry. “What motive does he have to—”The Potions Master said dryly, “The Defense Professor is always a suspect, Mr. Potter. You will notice a trend, given time.”Albus raised up a hand, a silencing gesture, and their heads all turnedto look at him. “But in this case there is another suspect,” Albus said quietly. “Voldemort.”That deadliest of unspeakable words seemed to echo around the room,canceling all the heat from the orange flames of the fireplace.“I do not know,” the old wizard said slowly, “I know all too little, of themethods of Voldemort’s immortality. He searched out those books beforeI did, I think. All I could find were ancient tales, scattered across too manyvolumes for him to remove. But to find truth among many stories is also awizard’s mastery, and this I have endeavored to do. There is a human sacrifice, a murder, of that I am certain; committed in coldest blood, the victim dying in horror. And old, old tales of wizards possessed, doing maddeeds, claiming the names of Dark Lords thought defeated; and there isusually a device, of that Dark Lord, which they wield…” Albus looked atHarry, the ancient eyes searching the younger. “I think, Harry—thoughyou will call it only inference—that the act of murder splits the soul. Thatby ritual of blackest horror, the torn fragment of soul is chained to thisworld. To a material thing of this world. Which must be, or which thenbecomes, a device of power.”Horcrux. The terrible name echoed in Minerva’s mind, though itseemed that—for what reason she did not know—Albus would not speakthat word in front of Harry.“And therefore,” the old wizard finished quietly, “the remainder ofthe soul is bound to its chained part, lingering here when its body is destroyed. A sad and painful existence, I think it would be; less than spirit,less than the meanest ghost…” The old wizard’s eyes were locked on Harry,who gazed back with his eyes narrowed. “It would take time for thatmutilated soul to regain a mockery of life. That is why we have had ourten-year reprieve, I believe; why Voldemort did not return at once. Butin time… that revenant would become capable of rising again.” The oldwizard spoke with grim precision. “It is clear, from the stories, that theDark Lords who return by possessing another’s form, wield lesser magicsthan they once knew. I do not think Voldemort would be satisfied withthat. He would take some other avenue to life. But Voldemort was moreSlytherin than Salazar, grasping at every opportunity. He would use hispitiful state, use his power of possession, if he had reason. If he could benefit by another’s… inexplicable fury.” Albus’s voice had fallen to almost awhisper. “That is what I suspect happened to Miss Granger.”Minerva’s throat was very dry. “He’s here,” she gasped. “Here, in Hogwarts—”Then she stopped, because the reason Voldemort had come toHogwarts—The old wizard glanced at her only briefly, and said, still in that whisper, “I am sorry, Minerva, you were right.”Harry’s voice was edged. “Right about what?”“Voldemort’s strongest avenue to life,” Dumbledore said heavily. “Themost desirable road for him, by which he would rise greater and moreterrible than ever before. It is guarded here, within this castle—”“Excuse me,” Harry said politely. “Are you stupid?”“Harry,” she said, but there was no force in her voice.“I mean, maybe you haven’t noticed this, Headmaster Dumbledore,but this castle is full of CHILDREN—”“I had no choice!” bellowed Dumbledore. The blue eyes were blazingnow, beneath the half-moon spectacles. “I do not own it, that thing whichVoldemort desires. It belongs to another, and is held here by his consent!I asked if it could be kept in the Department of Mysteries. But he wouldnot permit that—he said it must be within the wards of Hogwarts, in theplace of the Founders’ protection—” Dumbledore passed his hand acrosshis forehead. “No,” the old wizard said in a quieter voice. “I cannot passthis blame to him. He is right. There is too much power in that thing,too much that men desire. I agreed that the trap should be laid behindthe wards of Hogwarts, in the place of my own power.” The old wizardbowed his head. “I knew Voldemort would worm his way here somehow,and planned to trap him. I did not think—I did not dream—that he wouldtarry in an enemy fortress one minute longer than he must.”“But,” said Severus in some puzzlement, “what would the Dark Lordpossibly gain by killing Lucius’s only heir?”“Point of order,” Harry Potter said, a hard edge in his voice. “The motives of whoever’s behind this are not the primary issue. Our top priorityat this point is that an innocent Hogwarts student is in trouble!”The green eyes locked with the blue, as Albus Dumbledore gazed backat the Boy-Who-Lived—“Quite right, Mr. Potter,” Minerva said, she hadn’t even thought aboutit, the words just seemed to pop out of her lips. “Albus, who is watchingover Miss Granger now?”“Professor Flitwick has gone to her,” the Headmaster said.“She needs a lawyer,” Harry said. “Anyone who just blurts out ‘I did it’to the police—”“Unfortunately,” Minerva said, her tone taking on some of ProfessorMcGonagall’s sternness without thinking, “I doubt an attorney will be anyuse to Miss Granger at this point, Mr. Potter. She is to face the judgmentof the Wizengamot, and they would be exceedingly unlikely to free heron a technicality.”Harry was looking at her with an utterly incredulous expression, asthough suggesting that Hermione Granger didn’t need an attorney wasakin to suggesting that she be set on fire.“She is correct, Mr. Potter,” Severus said quietly. “Few court processesin this country involve solicitors.”Harry lifted his glasses and rubbed his eyes, briefly. “Fine. How do weget Hermione off the hook, exactly? I suppose it’s too much to hope thatwith all the lawyers gone, the judges understand the concept of ‘commonsense’ and ‘prior probability’ well enough to realize that twelve-year-oldgirls basically never commit cold-blooded murders?”“It is the Wizengamot that she faces,” said Severus. “The oldest NobleHouses, and certain other wizards of influence.” Severus’s face twistedin something approaching his customary sarcasm. “As for them showing common sense—you might as well expect them to make you a baconsandwich, Potter.”Harry nodded, his mouth set. “Exactly what sort of penalty is Hermione facing? Snapped wand and expulsion—”“No,” Severus said. “Nothing that light. Are you willfully misunderstanding, Potter? She is facing the Wizengamot. There is no set penalty.There is only the vote.”Harry Potter murmured, “The rule of law, in complex times, has proveditself deficient; we much prefer the rule of men, it’s vastly more efficient… There’sno constraining legal rules at all, then?”Light glinted off the old wizard’s half-moon glasses; he spoke carefully, and not without anger. “Legally, Harry, we are dealing with a blooddebt from Hermione Granger to the House of Malfoy. The Lord of Mal* 1279 *foy proposes a repayment of that debt, and then the Wizengamot voteson his proposal. That is all.”“But…” Harry said slowly. “Lucius was Sorted into Slytherin, he’s gotto realize that Hermione was just a pawn. Not the one he should actuallybe angry at. Right?”“No, Harry Potter,” Albus Dumbledore said heavily. “That is how youwish Lucius Malfoy would think. Lucius Malfoy himself… will not shareyour desire that he think that way.”Harry gazed at the Headmaster, his eyes growing colder, at the sametime that Minerva herself had to clamp down harder on her own emotions, stop her pacing and try to breathe. She’d been trying not to thinkabout it, trying to turn her thoughts away from it, but she knew. She’dknown since the instant she’d heard. She could see it in Albus’s eyes—“Is she facing capital punishment?” Harry said quietly, and chillswent all the way down Minerva’s spine at the undertones of that voice.“No!” Albus said. “No, not the Kiss, not Azkaban, not for a first-yearin Hogwarts. Our country is not so lost, not yet.”“But Lucius Malfoy,” Severus said tonelessly, “certainly will not be satisfied with only snapping her wand.”“All right,” Harry said commandingly. “As I see it, we’ve got two essential lines of attack. Line one, find the real culprit. Line two, other leverage over Lucius. Professor Quirrell saved Draco’s life, does that createa blood debt from House Malfoy to him that he could redeem to cancelHermione’s?”Minerva blinked in startlement again.“No,” Dumbledore said. The old wizard shook his head. “It was aclever thought—but no, Harry, I’m afraid not. There is an exception whenthe Wizengamot suspects that the circumstances of a life-debt may havebeen created deliberately. And the Defense Professor is hardly above suspicion. Thus Lucius would argue.”Harry nodded once, face set. “Headmaster, I know I said I wouldn’t—but under the circumstances—that time Draco cast that torture hex onme, is that debt enough—”“No,” the old wizard said (even as she blurted “What?” and Severuslifted an eyebrow). “It would not have been enough, and now it is nodebt at all. You are an Occlumens and cannot testify under Veritaserum.Draco Malfoy could be Obliviated of his own memory before he couldtestify—” Albus hesitated. “Harry… whatever you have done with Draco,you must assume that Lucius Malfoy will soon know of it.”Harry’s head sank into his hands. “He’ll give Draco Veritaserum.”“Yes,” Albus said quietly.The Boy-Who-Lived didn’t say anything, as he sat with his head in hishands.The Potions Master looked genuinely shocked. “Draco really was trying to help Miss Granger,” Severus said. “You—Potter, you actually—”“Turned him?” Harry said from between his hands. “I was aboutthree-quarters done. Taught him the Patronus Charm and everything. Idon’t know what will happen now, though.”“Voldemort has struck a grave blow against us, this day,” Albus said.The sound of old wizard’s voice was like the look of the boy with his headin his hands. “He has taken two of our pieces, with one… No. I should haveseen it earlier. He has taken two of Harry’s pieces with one move. Voldemort has begun his game again, not against myself, but against Harry.Voldemort knows the prophecy, he knows who his last foe shall be. He isnot waiting to face Hermione Granger and Draco Malfoy at Harry’s sidewhen they are grown. He is striking at them now.”“Maybe it’s You-Know-Who and maybe it isn’t,” Harry said, his voicesounding a little unsteady. “Let’s not narrow down the hypothesis spaceprematurely.” Harry took a breath and lowered his hands. “The otherthing we can try is to nail the real culprit before the trial—or at least findsolid evidence that someone else did it.”“Mr. Potter,” said Minerva, “Professor Quirrell told the Aurors that heknew of someone with a motive to harm Mr. Malfoy. Do you know whohe was talking about?”“Yes,” Harry said, after a hesitation. “But I think I shall conduct thatpart of my investigation with the Defense Professor—just as I would nothave Professor Quirrell in the room while we were discussing how to investigate him.”“He suspects me?” Severus said, then gave a short laugh. “Why, ofcourse he does.”1281 *“My own plan,” said Harry, “is to go look at the trophy room where thesupposed duel took place and see if I can discover anything anomalous.If you can tell the investigating Aurors to let me through—”“What investigating Aurors?” Severus said tonelessly.Harry Potter took a deep breath, slowly let it out, and then spoke again.“In mystery books it usually takes longer than one day to solve a crime, buttwenty-four hours is—no, thirty hours is eighteen hundred minutes. AndI can think of at least one other important place to look for clues—thoughit’ll have to be someone who can get into the Ravenclaw girls’ dorm. Backwhen Hermione was fighting bullies, she was finding notes under herpillow each morning, telling her where to go—”“Albus…” ground out Minerva.“I did not send them,” said the old wizard. His white eyebrows hadlifted in surprise. “I knew nothing of this. You think she was being played,Harry?”“It’s a possibility,” Harry said. “More so, because there’s a part of thispuzzle that you don’t know about yet.” Harry’s voice lowered, grew moreintense. “Headmaster, you already know that I got my father’s invisibility cloak from someone who left a note under my pillow, saying it wasan early Christmas present. I think we have to assume that’s the sameperson who left notes for Hermione—”“Harry,” the old wizard said, and hesitated momentarily. “Returningyour father’s cloak to you, does not seem to me like the act of a villain—”“Listen,” Harry Potter said urgently. “The part you don’t know is that after Bellatrix Black escaped from Azkaban, I found another note under mypillow, signed ‘Santa Claus’, saying that they’d heard you were shuttingme up inside Hogwarts, and that they were giving me an escape route tothe Salem Witches’ Institute in America. That note came with a deck ofcards, in which the King of Hearts was supposedly a portkey—”“Mr. Potter!” cried Professor McGonagall, she hadn’t even thought before she spoke. “That could well be a kidnapping attempt! You should havetold—”“Yes, Professor, I did the sensible thing,” the boy said levelly. “Asadapted to the circumstances, I did the sensible thing. I told ProfessorQuirrell. And according to Professor Quirrell, that portkey goes to some* 1282 *where in London—it’s definitely not strong enough to be an internationalportkey. Now it’s possible that the person who sent the note is honest, andthat the point in London is just a way station.” The boy reached into hisrobes and took out a deck of cards, along with a folded paper note. “I willtrust you not to go in guns blazing—I mean wands blazing—just in casethe sender is an ally of mine, if not yours. But if this is a trap, I say wespring it now. And whoever it is, take them alive so we can exhibit thembefore the Wizengamot, I cannot overemphasize that part.”Severus rose from his chair, his eyes now intent, and moved towardHarry. “I’ll need a hair of yours for Polyjuice, Mr. Potter—”“Let us not be hasty!” said Albus. “We have not yet examined the notessent to Miss Granger; there may be no resemblance after all. Severus,would you enter her dorm room and see if you can find those?”Harry Potter’s eyebrows had raised, even as he stood to offer the Potions Master better access to his mess of hair. “You think two differentpeople are running around Hogwarts leaving notes beneath pillows?”Severus gave a brief sardonic laugh, as his hand moved forward andplucked a hair, which soon was being carefully wrapped in silk. “Quitepossibly. If I have learned anything in my tenure as Head of Slytherin, Ihave learned what ridiculous messes arise when there is more than oneplotter and more than one plan. But Headmaster—I think Mr. Potter iscorrect that I should follow this portkey and see where it leads.”Albus hesitated, and then nodded reluctantly. “I will speak to you before you go, then.”Even as Harry Potter left the room for his own investigations, Severusspun on his heel and strode swiftly toward the jar of Floo powder, hiscloak rising behind him with his speed. “I’ll get some raw Polyjuice, addthe hair, and go. Headmaster, will you stand by to—”“Albus,” Minerva said, surprised at how steady her own voice was, “didyou leave those notes under Mr. Potter’s pillow?”Severus’s hand halted an instant before casting Floo powder into thefire.Dumbledore nodded to her, though the accompanying smile seemeda bit hollow. “You know me far too well, my dear.”“And I suppose the portkey goes to a friendly home where Mr. Potterwould be kept safe and sound until you arrived to pick him up and returnhim to Hogwarts?” Her voice tight—it was sensible, she could not deny itwas sensible, but somehow it seemed a little cruel.“It would depend on the circumstances,” the old wizard said quietly.“If Harry had gone so far—I might have let him make good his escape, fora time. Better to know where he was going, and ensure it was somewheresafe, with friends—”“And to think,” said Professor McGonagall, “that I had thought to reprimand Mr. Potter for not telling us about this important matter! Upbraid him for not having the sense to trust us!” Her voice had risen involume. “I shall skip that lecture, I suppose!”Severus was gazing at the Headmaster with narrowed eyes. “And thenotes to Miss Granger—”“The Defense Professor, very likely,” the old wizard said. “Still—thatis only a guess.”“I shall go look for them,” Severus said. “And then, I suppose, startlooking for You-Know-Who.” A frown crossed the Potions Master’s face.“A task at which I haven’t the faintest idea of where to start. Do you knowof any magics to find a soul, Headmaster?”The Divination classroom was lit by the dim red light of a hundred smallfires where burned a hundred kinds of incense, so that if you were to askin one word what the room looked like, the answer would be ‘smoke’. (Assuming you bothered to look at anything, when your nose was threatening to overload and die.) If your gaze could pierce those dank mists, youwould see a tiny, cluttered room in which forty stuffed armchairs, mostof them unused, were crammed around a small open space in the centerof the room, where a circular trapdoor waited on your escape.“The grim!” Professor Trelawney said in a quavering voice, as shepeered into George Weasley’s teacup. “The grim! It is a sign of death!One whom you know, George—someone you know is to die! And soon—yes, it shall be quite soon, I think—unless of course it is later—”It would have been a good deal scarier, thought Fred and George, ifshe hadn’t said the same thing to every single other student in their Divination class. They were hardly even thinking about it at this point; alltheir thoughts were on today’s disaster—The trapdoor in the floor flew open with a bang that caused ProfessorTrelawney to shriek and spill George’s tea all over his robes, and then aninstant later Dumbledore was whooshing up out of the floor with a birdof fire upon his shoulder.“Fred!” the old wizard said commandingly. His robes were the blackof a moonless night, his eyes hard like blue diamonds. “George! With me,now!”There was an collective gasp and by the time Fred and George wereclimbing down the ladder after the Headmaster, the entire class was already speculating what role they’d played in the attempted murder ofDraco Malfoy.The trapdoor had hardly slammed shut above them before all nearbysounds muted and the old wizard spun on them and held out a hand andcommanded, “Give me the map!”“M-map?” said Fred or George in total shock. They’d never evensuspected that Dumbledore suspected. “Why, w-we don’t know whatyou’re—”“Hermione Granger is in trouble,” said the old wizard.“The Map is in our dorm,” George or Fred said immediately. “Just giveus a few minutes to get it and we’ll—”The wizard’s arms swept them up as if they were hugging-pillows,there was a piercing cry and a flash of fire and then the three of themwere in the third-year Gryffindor’s boys’ dorm.A few moments later, Fred and George were handing over the Mapto the Headmaster, wincing only slightly at the sacrilege of giving theirprecious piece of the Hogwarts security system to the person who actuallyowned it, and the old wizard was frowning at the apparent blankness.“You’ve got to say,” they explained, “I solemnly swear that I am up to nogood—”“I decline to lie,” said the old wizard. He held the Map high and bellowed, “Hear me, Hogwarts! Deligitor prodi!” An instant later the Headmaster was wearing the Sorting Hat, which looked scarily right upon hishead, as though Dumbledore had always been waiting for a patchworkpointed hat to complete his existence.(Fred and George immediately memorized this phrase, just in case itwould work for somebody besides the Headmaster, and began trying tothink of pranks that would involve the Sorting Hat.)The old wizard wasted not a moment before sweeping the SortingHat off his head and turning it upside-down—it was hard to tell with theHat upside-down, but it looked a bit cross at the treatment—and thenplunged in his hand and drew out a crystal rod. With this instrument hebegan tracing rune-like patterns on the Map, muttering strange incantations that sounded not quite like Latin and echoed in their ears in anunusually creepy fashion. In the midst of tracing one rune he looked upat both of them, fixing them with a sharp glare. “I will return this to youlater, sons of Weasley. Go back to class.”“Yes, Headmaster,” they said, and hesitated. “Ah—about HermioneGranger, is she really going to be bound to serve Draco Malfoy forever ashis—”“Go,” said the old wizard.They went.When he was alone in the room, the old wizard looked down at themap, which had now written upon itself a fine line drawing of the Gryffindor dorms in which they stood, the small handwritten Albus P.W.B. Dumbledore the only name left therein.The old wizard smoothed the map, bent over it, and whispered, “FindTom Riddle.”The interrogation room at the Department of Magical Law Enforcementwas usually lit by a small orange light, so that the Auror interrogating youwould be leaning toward your uncomfortable metal chair with most oftheir face in shadow, preventing you from reading their expression, evenas they read yours.As soon as Mr. Quirrell had entered the room, the small orange lighthad dimmed and begun flickering like a candle about to be blown out bythe wind. The room was now lit by a sourceless ice-colored glow whichilluminated all of Mr. Quirrell’s pale skin like alabaster, except, somehow,his eyes, which stayed in darkness.The Auror on duty outside had surreptitiously tried to dispel thiseffect four times without the slightest success, despite the fact thatMr. Quirrell had politely surrendered his wand upon being detained forinterrogation, and had shown no sign of speaking any incantations norexerting any other power.“Quirinus… Quirrell,” drawled the man now sitting across fromwhere the Defense Professor had waited courteously. The interrogatorhad tawny hair that swept back like a lion’s mane, with yellowish eyes setinto the sternly lined face of a man late in his tenth decade. The man was,at this moment, leafing through a large folder of parchments that he hadtaken from a black and very solid-looking briefcase after he had limpedinto the room and sat down, seeming not to look at the face of the manhe was interrogating. He had not introduced himself.After some further leafing through parchments, carried out in silence,the Auror spoke again. “Born the 26th of September, 1955, to QuondiaQuirrell, of an acknowledged tryst with Lirinus Lumblung…” intonedthe Auror. “Sorted into Ravenclaw… O.W.L.S. quite good… N.E.W.T.S. inCharms, Transfiguration… an Outstanding in Muggle Studies, impressive… Ancient Runes, and ah yes, Defense. An Outstanding in that as well.Went on to become quite the tourist, visiting all sorts of places. Portkeyvisas for Transylvania, the Forbidden Empire, the City of Endless Night…my my, Texas.” The man looked up from the portfolio, eyes narrowed.“What were you doing there, Mr. Quirrell?”“Sightseeing, mostly in the Muggle areas,” the Defense Professor saideasily. “As you say, I am quite the tourist.”The man listened to this with a frown, then looked back down, thenup again. “I also see that you visited Fuyuki City in 1983.”The Defense Professor lifted an eyebrow in mild puzzlement. “Whatof it?”“What did you do in Fuyuki City?” The question snapped out razorsharp.The Defense Professor frowned slightly. “Nothing of any account.I visited some better-known sights, some less-known sights, and asidefrom that, kept to myself.”“Really?” the Auror said softly. “I find that reply rather interesting.”“How so?” said the Defense Professor.“Because there was no visa listed for Fuyuki City.” The man slammedthe folder shut. “You’re not Quirinus Quirrell. Who the hell are you?”The Potions Master walked quietly into the Ravenclaw girls’ dorm, thefirst-year dorm room, a festive place where bronze and blue competed tobe the color of stuffed animals, scarves and dresses, small bits of inexpensive jewelry, and posters of famous people. Hermione Granger’s bed waseasy to identify; it was the one that had been attacked by a book monster.Nobody else seemed to be around, at that time of day, and a numberof spells verified this.The Potions Master searched under Hermione Granger’s pillow,and beneath her bed, and then began going through her trunk, sorting through mentionable and unmentionable items without change ofexpression, and finally succeeded in drawing forth a set of papers describing places and times where bullies would be found, all of the paperssigned only with an elaborate ‘S’.A brief burst of fire later, the papers were gone, and the Potions Master left to report the failure of his mission.The Defense Professor was sitting calmly with his hands still folded in hislap. “If you consult Headmaster Dumbledore,” said the Defense Professor, “you will find that he is well aware of this matter, and that I agreed toteach his Defense class on the explicit condition that no inquiry be madeinto my—”In a lightning motion, the interrogator whipped out his wand andspat “Polyfluis Reverso!” at the same time that the Defense Professorsneezed, which somehow caused the mirror-silvered ray to disrupt in ashower of white sparks.“Pardon me,” the Defense Professor said politely.The smile that the Auror gave had absolutely no mirth in it. “Sowhere’s the real Quirinus Quirrell, eh? Under an Imperius in the bottomof a trunk somewhere, while you take a hair now and then for your illegalPolyjuice?”“You are making highly questionable assumptions,” the Defense Professor said with an edged voice. “What makes you think I did not stealhis body outright using incredibly Dark magic?”This was followed by a certain pause.“I suggest,” the Auror said, “that you take this seriously, Mr. WhoeverYou-Are.”“I’m sorry,” said the Defense Professor, leaning back in his chair, “butI see little reason to humble myself on this particular occasion. What areyou going to do, kill me?”“I don’t appreciate your humor,” the Auror said softly.“How unfortunate for you, Rufus Scrimgeour,” said the Defense Professor. “You have my deepest sympathy.” He tilted his head, seeming tostudy the interrogator; and even within the shadow of the ice-light, theeyes glinted.Padma stared down at her plate.“Hermione wouldn’t just do that!” yelled Mandy Brocklehurst, whowas practically in tears, in fact she was in tears, her voice would have beenloud enough to silence the Great Hall if it hadn’t been for all the otherstudents also screaming at each other. “I—I bet Malfoy tried to—to dothings to her—”“Our General would never do that!” Kevin Entwhistle yelled evenlouder than Mandy.“Of course he would!” shouted Anthony Goldstein. “Malfoy’s the sonof a Death Eater!”Padma stared down at her plate.Draco was the General of her army.Hermione was the founder of sphew.Draco had trusted her to be his second-in-command.Hermione was her fellow Ravenclaw.Both of them were her friends, maybe the two best friends she had.Padma stared down at her plate. She was glad the Sorting Hat hadn’toffered her Hufflepuff. If she’d been Sorted into Hufflepuff it would probably have been much more painful, trying to decide where her dividedloyalties lay…She blinked and realized that her vision had gotten blurry again, andraised a trembling hand to wipe once more at her eyes.Morag MacDougal snorted so loudly it was audible even amid the pandemonium of lunch, and said in a loud voice, “I bet Granger cheated in herbattle yesterday, I bet that’s why Malfoy challenged her—”“All of you SHUT UP!” roared Harry Potter, as he hit the table with hisfists so hard that plates rattled all the way along it.At any other time it would have gotten Professors reprimanding him,this time it just got a few nearby students to look.“I’d wanted to eat lunch,” Harry Potter said, “and then get back to investigating, so I wasn’t going to talk. But you’re all being silly, and whenthe truth comes out you’re going to regret what you said about innocentpeople. Draco didn’t do anything, Hermione didn’t do anything, theywere both False-Memory-Charmed!” Harry Potter’s voice had been rising on the last words. “How is that not BLOODY OBVIOUS?”“You think we’ll believe that?” Kevin Entwhistle yelled right back athim. “That’s what everyone says! ‘I didn’t do it, it was all just a False Memory Charm!’ You think we’re stupid?”And Morag nodded right along with him, with a condescending look.The look that came over Harry Potter’s face then made Padma flinch.“I see,” Harry Potter said, it wasn’t a shout so Padma had to strain tohear it. “Professor Quirrell isn’t here to explain to me how stupid people are, but I bet this time I can get it on my own. People do somethingdumb and get caught and are given Veritaserum. Not romantic mastercriminals, because they wouldn’t get caught, they would have learned Occlumency. Sad, pathetic, incompetent criminals get caught, and confessunder Veritaserum, and they’re desperate to stay out of Azkaban so theysay they were False-Memory-Charmed. Right? So your brain, by sheer Pavlovian association, links the idea of False Memory Charms to patheticcriminals with unbelievable excuses. You don’t have to consider the specific details, your brain just pattern-matches the hypothesis into a bucket ofthings you don’t believe, and you’re done. Just like my father thought thatmagical hypotheses could never be believed, because he’d heard so manystupid people talking about magic. Believing a hypothesis that involvesFalse Memory Charms is low-status.”“What are you blithering about?” said Morag, looking down her noseat the Boy-Who-Lived.“You think we’d believe anything you say?” yelled a slightly olderlooking Ravenclaw witch who Padma didn’t recognize. “When youturned Granger Dark?”“And I’m not going to complain,” Harry Potter said in an eerily calmvoice, “about wizards not having any logic and believing the craziest things. Because I said that to Professor Quirrell once, and he just gaveme this look and said that if I wasn’t blinded by my upbringing I couldthink of a hundred more ridiculous things that lots of Muggles believe.What you’re all doing is very human and very normal and doesn’t makeyou unusually bad people, so I’m not going to complain.” The Boy-WhoLived rose up from his bench. “I’ll see you all later.”And Harry Potter walked away from them, walked away from all ofthem.“You’re not thinking he’s right, are you?” said Su Li from beside her,in a tone which made it clear what she thought.“I—” said Padma. Her words seemed to be caught in her throat, herthoughts seemed to be caught in her head. “I—I mean—I—”1291 *If you think hard enough you can do the impossible.(It had always been an article of faith with Harry. There’d been a timewhen he’d acknowledged the laws of physics as ultimate limitations, andnow he suspected there were no true limits at all.)If you think fast enough you can sometimes do the impossible quickly……sometimes.Only sometimes.Not always.Not reliably.The Boy-Who-Lived stared around the trophy room, surrounded byawards and cups and plates and shields and statues and medals kept behind thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, of crystal glass displays. Foras many centuries as Hogwarts had existed, this room had been accumulating details. A week, a month, maybe even a year, wouldn’t have sufficed to take the ‘examine’ option on every item in the room. With Professor Flitwick gone, Harry had asked Professor Vector if there was anyway to detect damage to the wards around the crystal cases, verify theresidue that a real duel should have left behind. Harry had raced throughthe Hogwarts library looking for spells to tell the difference between oldfingerprints and new fingerprints, or to detect lingering exhalations in aroom. And all those attempts at playing detective had failed.There were no clues, none that he was smart enough to find.Professor Snape had said that the portkey led to an empty house inLondon, with no sign of anyone or anything else.Professor Snape hadn’t found any notes in Hermione’s dorm.Headmaster Dumbledore had said that Voldemort’s spirit was probably hiding out in the Chamber of Secrets where the Hogwarts securitysystem couldn’t find him. Harry had snuck into the Slytherin dungeonsunder the Cloak of Invisibility and spent the rest of the afternoon lookingthrough all the obvious places, but he hadn’t found anything snaky that
