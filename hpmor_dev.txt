And Harry continued to take stock of the moderately hopelesslooking situation.Did Harry need to re-evaluate the probability that Bellatrix was evil?…not in any mission-relevant sense. It was a given that Bellatrix wascurrently evil. Whether she was an innocent who’d been made that wayby torture and Legilimency and unspeakable rituals, or whether she’d chosen it of her own will, didn’t have much bearing on the current situation.The key fact was that while Bellatrix thought Harry was the Dark Lord,she would obey him.That was one resource, then. But Bellatrix was starved and ninetenths dead…‘Oh, I feel a little better now, how strange…’Bellatrix had said that, in her shattered voice, after Harry’s Patronushad blazed out of control.Harry thought, and he couldn’t have quite said why he thought this,it might have just been his own mind making things up, but… it seemedlikely that what the Dementors had taken from you long ago was lost forever. But what the Dementors had taken from you recently, the True Patronus Charm might give back. Like the difference between emptyinga cup, and the unused cup fading away. Bellatrix, then, might have gotback what she’d lost in just the last week or so. Not any happy memories,those would have been eaten years ago. But whatever strength and magichad been drained from her in just the last week, she might have regained.Like the equivalent of getting a week of rest, a week to build up her magicagain…Harry looked at Professor Quirrell’s snake form.…maybe enough for an Innervate.If awakening Professor Quirrell was, in fact, a smart thing to do.
850 *




Some of the despair came back to Harry, then. He couldn’t trust Professor Quirrell, couldn’t trust that reviving him would be wise, not afterwhat had just happened.Steady, Harry thought to himself, and looked at the crumpled form ofthe Auror.Bellatrix might also be able to manage a Memory Charm.That could be step one, anyway. It wasn’t exactly getting everyonesafely out of Azkaban, and the Aurors would know afterward that something strange had happened, they might suspect Bellatrix’s body and perform an autopsy. But it was a step.…and would it be all that hard to get out of Azkaban? If they couldget to the top of Azkaban quickly enough, before the Auror was supposedto report back in, before anyone noticed him missing, then they couldjust fly out through the hole Professor Quirrell had made, and get farenough away from Azkaban to activate the portkey Harry already hadin his possession. (Both Professor Quirrell and Harry had portkeys, andboth were powerful enough to transport two humans, plus or minus asnake. As with their doubly-concealed departure from Mary’s Room, Professor Quirrell had put enough safety margin in his plans to impress evenHarry.)Bellatrix could carry Professor Quirrell’s snake form, which Harrydared not touch or levitate.Harry turned and strode quickly toward where Bellatrix was waitingon the stairs. He could feel his spirits reviving a little. It was starting tolook like a good plan, and there was no time to waste in going about it.What to do with Professor Quirrell, or for that matter Bellatrix, after the portkey took them to where they were supposed to hand Bellatrix over to the psychiatric healer… well, Harry could work that out alongthe way. Harry would probably have to bamboozle the healer into doing something—which was going to take one hell of a bamboozling, andHarry wasn’t even sure what he wanted done—but he and Bellatrix had toget moving now.The main problem Harry saw, as he quickly ran the whole process forward in his imagination, would come when they reached the roof. Professor Quirrell had been supposed to sneak around invisibly and Confund






the monitors that would notice visitors in the aerial surroundings of Azkaban, causing them to see a repeating loop of scenery for a few minutes.Professor Quirrell had said that he couldn’t Disillusion Harry’s Patronus;and if they switched off the Patronus, the Dementors would notice Bellatrix was missing, and alert the Aurors…Harry’s train of thought stumbled.There were times when ‘Aw, crap’ just didn’t seem to cover it.
Li’s hands were sure despite the adrenaline, as he unlocked the bars onthe Vanishing Cabinet that linked Azkaban to a well-guarded room inthe interior of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. (A one-wayVanishing Cabinet, of course. The wards permitted a few fast ways intoAzkaban, all of them highly restricted, and no fast ways out.)Li stepped well back, pointed his wand at the Cabinet, spoke the incantation “Harmonia Nectere Passus”, and not a second later—The door of the Cabinet burst open with a bang, and into the roomstrode a heavy-set, square-jawed witch with greyed hair cropped closearound her head. She wore no rank signs as she wore no jewelry or otherornamentation, it was only an ordinary Auror’s robes that she deemed fitto grace herself: Director Amelia Bones, head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and said to be the only witch in the DMLE whocould take Mad-Eye Moody in a fair fight (not that either of those twowere the sort to fight fairly). Li had heard rumors that Amelia could Apparate within the bounds of the DMLE, and this was the sort of thing thatgave rise to rumors like that, he’d called in the alarm not fifty seconds ago.“Get into the air, now!” Amelia barked over her shoulder at the femaleAuror trio following behind her with police broomsticks, they must haveall been crushed in there, waiting for Li to activate the Cabinet. “I wantmore aerial coverage on this place! And make sure you keep up your antiDisillusionment Charms!” Then her head turned toward him. “Report,Auror Li! Do we know how they got in yet?”
852 *




Another Auror trio holding broomsticks materialized in the Vanishing Cabinet and strode out after them even as Li began talking.They were followed by a trio of Hit Wizards in full battle gear.Then another trio of Hit Wizards.Then another broomstick team.
The emaciated form that was Bellatrix Black was resting motionless onthe stairs when Harry got there, eyes closed, and when Harry asked in acold, high whisper whether she was awake, he got no response.A brief twitch of panic was countered by the thought that ProfessorQuirrell had knocked her out to prevent her from hearing the Dark Lord’scringing servant suddenly turn into a hardened criminal and then anexpert battlemage. Which was good, because she wouldn’t have heardHarry’s voice saying ‘Expecto Patronum’.Harry drew back the hood of the Cloak, pointed his wand at Bellatrix,and whispered as gently as he could, “Innervate.”From the way Bellatrix’s body jerked a little, Harry didn’t think he’dmanaged to get it quite gentle enough.The sunken dark eyes opened.“Bella dear,” Harry said in his cold, high voice, “I am afraid we’ve runinto a bit of a problem. Have you recovered enough to do small magics?”There was a pause, and then Bellatrix’s pale head nodded.“Very good,” Harry said dryly. “I won’t ask you to walk unaided,Bella dear, but I am afraid you must walk.” He pointed his wand at her.“Wingardium Leviosa.”Harry kept the flow of force down to something he could sustain fora while, and it was still probably lifting two-thirds of her current bodyweight. She was… thin.Slowly, as though for the first time in years, Bellatrix Black pushedherself to her feet.

853 *




Amelia strode into the duty room, Auror Li and his silver badger following behind her. She’d spun her Time-Turner the moment she’d heard thealarm, and then spent a tense hour preparing her forces for entry. Youcouldn’t loop time within Azkaban itself, Azkaban’s future couldn’t interact with its past, so she hadn’t been able to arrive before the DMLE hadgotten the message, but she should have arrived in time…Her eyes went straight to the corpse, uncloaked and looking very dead,floating beyond the viewing window.“Where is Bellatrix Black?” Amelia demanded, showing no fear beforethe creature of fear.Even her own blood froze for an instant, as the corpse parted its lips,and gurgled, “Do not know.”
Harry watched, now fully invisible once more, as Bellatrix slowly leaneddown, took Professor Quirrell’s wand (which Harry dared not touch), andslowly straightened again.Then Bellatrix pointed the wand at the snake, and said, her voice precise though it was still a whisper, “Innervate.”The snake did not stir.“Shall I try again, my Lord?” she whispered.“No,” Harry said. He swallowed the sick feeling. Harry had decided tosay the hell with it and try to revive Professor Quirrell after he’d realizedthat the Dementors had probably alerted the Aurors by now. His high,cold voice went on, unperturbed, “Do you think you are able to perform aMemory Charm, dear Bella?”Bellatrix paused, and then said, hesitantly, “I think so, my Lord.”“Eliminate that Auror’s last half-hour of memory,” Harry commanded.He’d thought a bit about whether he wanted to provide any justificationfor that, what he would say if Bellatrix asked why they weren’t just killinghim, in which case Harry would explain that they were pretending to bea different power group and then tell her to shut up—But Bellatrix simply pointed her wand at the Auror, stood silently fora time, and finally whispered, “Obliviate.”
854 *




She swayed, then, but did not fall.“Very good, my dear Bella,” Harry said, and chuckled thinly. “And Iwill ask you to carry that snake.”Again, the woman said nothing, demanded no explanations, didn’task why Harry or the apparently-invisible Patronus caster couldn’t do it.She only staggered to where the long snake lay, slowly bent over, pickedit up, draped it over her shoulder.(A tiny little part of Harry observed that it was very relaxing to have aminion that would just follow orders so unquestioningly, and even got asfar as thinking that he could totally get used to having a minion like Bellatrix, before that mind-fraction was screamed into silence by his mortallyoffended remainder.)“Follow,” the boy commanded his minion, and began to walk.
It was starting to get crowded in the duty room, almost too crowded tobreathe, though there was still space around Amelia herself; if needing tobreathe meant that you had to crowd Director Bones, it was better not tobreathe.Amelia looked at where Ora was fiddling with Auror McCusker’s mirror. “Specialist Weinbach,” she barked, causing the young witch to start.“Any response from One-Hand’s mirror?”“None,” Ora said nervously, “it’s… I mean it has to be jammed, notdead, carefully jammed because it didn’t set off the alarms, but the line isso blank the mirror might as well be broken…”Amelia didn’t let her expression change, though the part of her thatwas already mourning One-Hand got a little sadder and a lot more angry.Seven months, he’d had seven months left until his retirement after a fullcentury of service. She remembered him as an eager young Auror, so verylong ago, and his whole career he’d served the DMLE with perfect loyalty,at least when it came to anything really important…Someone would burn for this.
855 *




The Dementor still hovered outside the window, casting its uselessshadow of dread over their operations; all the creature could do was gurgle its lack of knowledge or fail to reply at all, when asked questions like‘Did Bellatrix Black escape?’ and ‘Why can’t you find her?’ and ‘How isshe being hidden?’ Amelia was starting to worry that the criminals werealready gone, when—“We found a hole in the roof over C spiral!” someone shouted fromthe doorway. “Still open, ward circumventions still active!”Amelia’s lips peeled back in a smile like a wolf opening its jaws to eat.Bellatrix Black was still in Azkaban.And in Azkaban, Bellatrix Black would remain forever.She took a stride toward the window, ignoring the Dementor now,and looked up at the sky above, to check with her own eyes the patrollingbroomsticks. She couldn’t see the whole sky from here, but she saw tenbrooms go past on a patrol pattern and that already ought to be enough tocatch anyone, though she fully meant to put every broom she could in theair. Her Aurors were equipped with the fastest racing broom currentlyon the market, the Nimbus 2000; no unsuccessful chases for her people.Amelia turned back from the window, and frowned. The room wasgetting ridiculously crowded, and two thirds of these people didn’t needto be here, they just wanted to be close to the center of the action. If therewas one thing Amelia couldn’t tolerate, it was people who did what theywanted instead of what was needed.“All right, you lot!” Amelia bellowed at them. “Stop hanging aroundhere and start securing the top level of each spiral! That’s right,” she saidto the looks of surprise, “all three! They could tunnel through a floor ora ceiling to go between them, in case you hadn’t worked that out! We’regoing down level by level until we catch them! I’ll take C spiral, Scrimgeour, you’re on B…” She paused, then, remembering that Mad-Eye hadretired last year, who could she… “Shacklebolt, you’re on the A spiral, takewith the strongest other fighters! Check every set of cells you pass, lookunder blankets, do the full set of detection Charms in every corridor! Nobody leaves Azkaban until the criminals are caught, nobody! And…” People looked at Amelia in surprise as her voice trailed off.
856 *




The criminals had invented some way to prevent the Dementors from findingBellatrix Black.That ought to have been impossible.It chilled her blood, contemplating that. It was like…Amelia took a deep breath, and spoke once more, in a voice of steelcommand. “And when you catch them, make bloody sure they’re the realcriminals and not our own people forced to take Polyjuice. Anyone behaves oddly, check them for the Imperius Curse. Keep each other in sightat all times. Don’t assume an Auror uniform is friendly if you don’t recognize the face.” She turned to the communications specialist. “Tell thebroomsticks. If one of the brooms peels off for no reason, half of them areto hunt it down while the rest keep patrolling. And change the harmonicson everything changeable, they may have stolen our keys.” Then back tothe rest of the room. “No Auror is above suspicion unless they have nofamily left to threaten.”She saw it, the cold looks that came over the older faces, saw some ofthe younger Aurors flinch, and knew that they understood.But she said it out loud, just to be sure.“We’re fighting the old Wizarding War today, everyone. Just becauseYou-Know-Who is dead doesn’t mean the Death Eaters have forgotten histricks. Now go!”
Harry walked in silence through the gas-lit grey corridor, invisible besideBellatrix and the silver shape following them, trying to think of a betterplan.At first, when he’d realized that the Aurors probably knew already,and that moreover, Professor Quirrell wasn’t waking up…His thoughts had frozen up there, for a second.And then stayed frozen, even as he’d gotten himself and Bellatrixheading downward, to buy as much time as possible; the Aurors, Harryfigured, would start at the top and move down level by level. The Aurorscould afford to move slowly and securely; they knew their prey had noway out.
857 *




Harry hadn’t been able to think of any way out.Until Harry had said to himself, well, if it was just a war game, what wouldGeneral Chaos do?From which an answer had followed instantly.And then Harry had thought, but if it’s that easy, why hasn’t anyone broken out of Azkaban before?And after he’d realized the possible problem: Fine, what would GeneralChaos do about that?Whereupon General Chaos had come up with an amendment to hisfirst plan.It was…It was the most insanely Gryffindor thing Harry had ever…So now he was trying to think of a better plan, and not having muchluck.Picky picky picky, said Gryffindor. Who was complaining about not havingany plan one minute earlier? You should be glad we came up with anything at all,Mister Now-We’re-Doomed.“My Lord,” Bellatrix whispered haltingly, as she navigated the nextflight of stairs downward, “am I going back to my cell, my Lord?”Harry’s brain was distracted, so it took him that long to process thewords, and then another moment to process the horror, while Bellatrixcontinued speaking.“I would… please, my Lord, I would very much rather die,” her voicesaid. And then, in a smaller voice, a whisper that was barely there, “but Iwill go back if you ask it of me, my Lord…”“We are not going back to your cell,” hissed Harry’s voice, on automatic. Nothing of what he felt was allowed to reach his face.Um… said Hufflepuff. Did you seriously just think, ‘You ought to work forme, I would appreciate you?’A stone would respond to that kind of loyalty, Harry thought. Even if I’monly getting it by mistake, I can’t help but—She’s the Dark Lord’s loyal killer and torturer, and the supposed reason she’sloyal is because an innocent girl was broken into pieces and used as raw materialto make her, said Hufflepuff. Did you forget?
858 *




If someone shows me that much loyalty, even by mistake, there’s a part of methat can’t help but feel something. The Dark Lord must have been… evil doesn’tseem like a strong enough word, he must have been empty… to not appreciate herloyalty, artificial or not.The better parts of Harry didn’t have much to say to that.And that was when Harry heard it.It was faint, and it grew louder with every step they took forward.A woman’s voice, distant, indistinct.His ears, automatically, strained to make out the words.“…please don’t…”“…didn’t mean…”“…don’t die…”Then his brain knew who he was hearing, and in almost the same moment, figured out what he was hearing.Because Professor Quirrell wasn’t there to keep the silence any more,and Azkaban was not, in fact, silent.Faint the woman’s voice, repeating:“No, I didn’t mean it, please don’t die!”“No, I didn’t mean it, please don’t die!”It got louder with every step Harry took, he could hear the emotion inthe words now, the horror, the remorse, the desperation of…“No, I didn’t mean it, please don’t die!”…the woman’s worst memory, rehearsing over and over again…“No, I didn’t mean it, please don’t die!”…the murder that had sent her to Azkaban…“No, I didn’t mean it, please don’t die!”…where she was sentenced by the Dementors to watch whoever she’dkilled, die and die and die in an infinite repeating loop. Though she musthave been put in Azkaban recently, from the amount of life left in hervoice.The thought came to Harry, then, that Professor Quirrell had passedthose doors, heard those sounds, and given not the slightest sign ofdisturbance; and Harry would have called it a positive proof of evil, ifHarry’s own lips hadn’t remained silent in the presence of Bellatrix, his
859 *




breathing regular, while something inside him screamed and screamedand screamed.The Patronus brightened, not out of control, but it brightened, withevery step Harry took forward.It brightened further as Harry and Bellatrix descended the stairs,she stumbled and Harry offered her his left arm thrust outside theCloak, braving the sense of doom from being that close to the snakedraped around her neck. There was a surprised look on her face, but sheaccepted it, and said nothing.It helped Harry, being able to help Bellatrix, but it wasn’t enough.Not when he saw the huge metal door in the center of that level’s corridor.Not when they came closer, and the woman’s voice fell silent, becausethere was a Patronus near her now, and she wasn’t reliving her worstmemory any more.Good, said a voice inside him. That was step one.Harry’s steps carried him inevitably forward toward the metal door.And…Now unlock the door—…Harry kept walking…What do you think you’re doing? Go back and get her out of there!…kept walking…Save her! What are you doing? She’s hurting YOU HAVE TO SAVE HER!The portkey Harry was carrying could transport two humans, onlytwo, plus or minus a snake. If they’d had Professor Quirrell’s portkey too…but they didn’t, Professor Quirrell’s human form was carrying that, therewas no way to get it… Harry could only save one person today, and therewas only one person on the lowest level of Azkaban, in the most desperateneed…“DON’T GO!” The voice came in a scream from behind the metal door.“No, no, no, don’t go, don’t take it away, don’t don’t don’t—”There was a light in the corridor and it grew brighter.“Please,” sobbed the woman’s voice, “please, I can’t remember my children’s names any more—”




“Sit down, Bella,” Harry’s voice said, somehow he kept his voice in acold whisper, “I must deal with this,” the Hover Charm diminishing andswitching off even as Bella obediently sat down, her skeletal form darkagainst the brightening air.I’ll die, thought Harry.The air went on brightening.After all, it wasn’t a certainty that Harry would die.It was just a probability of death, and weren’t some things worth aprobability of dying?The air went on brightening, the greater Patronus was beginning toform around him, the brilliant human shape was becoming indistinctwithin the burning air, as Harry’s life went to feed the fire.If I wipe out the Dementors, then even if I live, they’ll know it was me, that Iwas the one who did this… I’ll lose my support, lose the war…Yeah? said the inner voice that was urging him on. After you destroy allthe Dementors in Azkaban? I’d think that’d tend to prove your credentials as aLight Lord, actually, so SAVE HER SAVE HER YOU HAVE TO SAVE HER—The humanoid shape could no longer be seen as a separate entity.The corridor couldn’t be seen.Harry’s own body was invisible within the Cloak.There was only a bodiless viewpoint within an infinite expanse of silver light.Harry could feel the life leaving him, fueling the spell; far away, hecould feel the shadows of Death begin to fray.I meant to accomplish more with my life than this… I was going to fight theDark Lord, I was going to merge the wizarding and Muggle worlds…Lofty goals seemed very distant, very abstract, compared to onewoman begging him for help, it wasn’t certain that Harry would ever doanything more important than this one thing, this one thing that hecould do now and here.And with what might have been his last breath, Harry thought:There are other Dementors, probably other Azkabans… if I’m going to do this,I should do it when I’m closer to the central pit, it will take less of my life that way,which increases the probability that I’ll survive to destroy other Dementors… even






assuming this is the optimal thing to do, if there’s a right time and place to do this,it isn’t now and here, IT ISN’T NOW AND HERE!What? said the other part of him indignantly, as it searched for a counterargument that didn’t exist—Slowly the light died back down, as Harry concentrated on that oneindisputable fact, the one obvious truth that they weren’t in the optimalplace, the time couldn’t be now…Slowly the light died back down.Part of Harry’s life flowed back into him.Part had been lost as radiation.But Harry had enough left to stay on his feet, and keep the silver human shape bright; and when his wand arm raised and his voice whispered “Wingardium Leviosa”, the magic flowed obediently out of him andhelped Bellatrix to her feet. (For it wasn’t his magic he had expended, ithad never been his magic that fueled the Patronus Charm.)I swear, Harry thought, breathing as regularly as he could in Bellatrix’spresence, while tears streamed down his invisible cheeks, I swear upon mylife and my magic and my art as a rationalist, I swear by everything I hold sacredand all my happy memories, I give my oath that someday I will end this place,please, please may I be forgiven…And the two of them walked on, as a murderess’s voice screamed andbegged someone to come back and save her.There should have been more time, there should have been a ceremony, for Harry’s sacrifice of that piece of himself, but Bellatrix was beside him and so Harry just had to keep on walking without a pause, sayingnothing, breathing evenly.So Harry walked on, leaving a piece of himself behind. It would dwellin this place and time forever, he knew. Even after Harry came back someday with a company of other True Patronus casters and they destroyedall the Dementors here. Even if he melted the triangular building andburned the island low enough that the sea would wash over it, leavingno trace that such a place as this had ever once existed. Even then hewouldn’t get it back.


862 *




The flock of luminous creatures stopped staring downward, and beganpatrolling the metal corridor as if nothing had happened.“Just like last time?” Director Bones snapped in the direction of AurorLi, and the young Auror replied, “Yes, ma’am.”The Director fired off another query to see if the Dementors couldnow find their target, and looked unsurprised to hear a negative reply afew seconds later.Emmeline Vance was feeling torn between her loyalties.Emmeline wasn’t a member of the Order of the Phoenix any more,they had disbanded after the end of the last war. And during the war,she’d known, they’d all known, that Director Crouch had quietly approvedof their off-the-books battle.Director Bones wasn’t Crouch.But they were hunting Bellatrix Black now, who had been a DeathEater, and who was certainly being rescued by Death Eaters. Their Patronuses were behaving oddly—all the bright creatures stopping and staring off downward, before they’d gone back to following their masters.And the Dementors couldn’t find their target.It seemed to her that this would be an extremely good time to consultAlbus Dumbledore.Should she just suggest to Director Bones that they contact Dumbledore? But if Director Bones hadn’t contacted him already…Emmeline wavered for a while, probably too long, and then finally decided. The hell with it, she thought. We’re all on the same side, we need to sticktogether whether Director Bones likes it or not.At a thought, her silver sparrow fluttered onto her shoulder.“Drop behind us to guard our rear,” Emmeline murmured softly, almost without moving her lips, “wait until no one is looking directly atyou, then go to Albus Dumbledore. If he is not already by himself, waituntil he is. And tell him this: Bellatrix Black is breaking out of Azkaban,and the Dementors cannot find her.”

863 *


it was thankfully silent, the metal door on the next level down.Silent,Either there wasn’t someone behind there, or they were hurting qui-
etly, maybe they were screaming but their voice had given out already, orthey were just muttering quietly to themselves in the dark…I’m not sure I can do this, Harry thought, and he couldn’t blame the despairing thought on the Dementors either. It would be better to be lower,safer to be lower, his plan would take time to implement and the Aurorswere probably already working their way down. But if Harry had to passany more of those metal doors while staying silent and keeping his breathing perfectly regular, he might go mad; if he had to leave a piece of himselfbehind at each one, soon there wouldn’t be anything left of him—A luminous moonlit cat leaped into existence and landed in front ofHarry’s Patronus. Harry almost screamed, which wouldn’t have helpedhis image with Bellatrix.“Harry!” said the voice of Professor McGonagall, sounding as alarmedas Harry had ever heard from her. “Where are you? Are you all right? Thisis my Patronus, answer me!”With a convulsive effort, Harry cleared his mind, repurposed histhroat, forced calm, swapped in a different personality like an Occlumency barrier. It took a few seconds and he hoped like hell that
865 *




Professor McGonagall didn’t notice a problem with that thanks to thecommunications delay, just as he hoped like hell that Patronuses didn’treport on their surroundings.A young boy’s innocent voice said, “I’m in Mary’s Place, Professor, inDiagon Alley. Going to the restroom actually. What’s wrong?”The cat leaped away, and Bellatrix began to chuckle softly, dusty appreciative laughter, but she cut herself off abruptly at a hiss from Harry.A moment later the cat returned, and said in Professor McGonagall’svoice, “I’m coming to pick you up right now. Don’t go anywhere, if you’renot around the Defense Professor don’t go back to him, don’t say anything to anyone, I’ll be there as quickly as I can!”And the bright cat blurred forward and vanished.Harry glanced down at his watch, noting down the time, so that afterhe got everyone out of here, and Professor Quirrell anchored the TimeTurner again, he could go back and be in the restroom of Mary’s Place atthe appropriate time…You know, said the problem-solving part of his brain, there’s a limit tohow many constraints you can add to a problem before it really is impossible, youknow that?It shouldn’t have mattered, and it didn’t really, it didn’t compare tothe suffering of a single prisoner in Azkaban, and yet Harry still foundhimself feeling very aware that if his plan didn’t end with him beingpicked up from Mary’s Place just like he’d never left, and the Defense Professor looking completely innocent of any and all wrongdoing, ProfessorMcGonagall was going to kill him.
As their team prepared to eat another bite of territory out of C spiral,shielding and scanning before dispelling the previous shield to their rear,Amelia was tapping her fingers on her hip and wondering if she ought toconsult the obvious expert. If only he wasn’t so—Amelia heard the familiar crack of fire and knew what she would seeas she turned.
866 *




A third of her Aurors were spinning around and leveling their wandson the old wizard in half-moon glasses and a long silver beard who hadappeared directly within their midst, a bright red-golden phoenix on hisshoulder.“Hold your fire!” Polyjuice made it easy to forge the face, but fakingthe phoenix travel would have been rather more difficult—the wards permitted it as one of the fast ways into Azkaban, though there were no fastways out.The old witch and the old wizard stared at each other for a long moment.(Amelia wondered, in the back of her mind, which of her Aurors hadsent the word, there were several former members of the Order of thePhoenix with her; she tried to remember, in the back of her mind, if she’dseen Emmeline’s sparrow or Andy’s cat missing from the flock of brightcreatures; but she knew that it was futile. It might not even be any ofher people, for the old meddler often knew things he had no way at all ofknowing.)Albus Dumbledore inclined his head to Amelia in a courteous gesture.“I hope I am not unwelcome here,” the wizard said calmly. “We are all onthe same side, are we not?”“That depends,” Amelia said in a hard voice. “Are you here to helpus catch criminals, or to protect them from the consequences of theiractions?” Are you going to try to stop the killer of my brother from getting herwell-deserved Kiss, old meddler? From what Amelia heard, Dumbledore hadgotten smarter toward the end of the war, mostly due to Mad-Eye’s nonstop nagging; but had relapsed into his foolish mercies the instant Voldemort’s body was found.A dozen small points of white and silver, reflections of the shining animals, gleamed off the old wizard’s half-moon glasses as he spoke. “Evenless than you would I see Bellatrix Black freed,” the old wizard said. “Shemust not leave this prison alive, Amelia.”Before Amelia could speak again, even to express her surprised gratification, the old wizard gestured with his long black wand and a blazingsilver phoenix sprang into existence, brighter perhaps than all their otherPatronuses put together. It was the first time she’d seen that spell cast
867 *




wordlessly. “Order all your Aurors to cancel their Patronus Charms forten seconds,” said the old wizard. “What darkness cannot find, the lightmay.”Amelia snapped off the order to the communications officer, whowould notify all Aurors through their mirrors, commanding Dumbledore’s will to be done.That took a few moments, and it became a period of awful silence,none of the Aurors daring to speak, while Amelia tried to weigh her ownthoughts. She must not leave this prison alive… Albus Dumbledore wouldn’tturn into Bartemius Crouch without a strong reason. If he’d meant to tellher why, he already would have; but it certainly wasn’t a positive sign.Still, it was good to know they’d be able to work together on this one.“Now,” said a chorus of mirrors, and all the Patronus Charms winkedout except that blazing silver phoenix.“Is there another Patronus still present?” the old wizard said clearlyto the bright creature.The bright creature dipped its head in a nod.“Can you find it?”The silver head nodded again.“Will you remember it, should it depart and come again?”A final nod from the blazing phoenix.“It is done,” Dumbledore said.“Over,” said all the mirrors a moment later, and Amelia raised herwand and began recasting her own Patronus. (Though it took some extra concentration, with that wolfish smile already on her face, to thinkof the first time Susan had kissed her cheek, instead of dwelling on thelooming fate of Bellatrix Black. That other Kiss was a happy thought indeed, but not quite the right kind for the Patronus Charm.)
They hadn’t even gotten to the end of that corridor before Harry’s Patronus raised its hand, politely, as though in a classroom.
868 *




Harry thought quickly. The question was how to—no, that was alsoobvious.“It seems,” Harry said in a coldly amused voice, “that someone hasinstructed this Patronus to speak its message only to me.” He chuckled.“Well then. Pardon me, dear Bella. Quietus.”At once the silver humanoid said in Harry’s own voice, “There is another Patronus which seeks this Patronus.”“What?” said Harry. And then, without pausing to think about whatwas happening, “Can you block it? Stop it from finding you?”The silver humanoid shook its head.
No sooner did Amelia and the other Aurors finish recasting their Patronus Charms, when—The blazing silver phoenix flew off, and the true red-golden phoenixfollowed it, and the old wizard calmly strode after both of them with hislong wand gripped low.The shields around their territory parted around the old wizard likewater, and closed behind him with hardly a ripple.“Albus!” shouted Amelia. “What do you think you’re doing?”But she already knew.“Do not follow me,” the old wizard’s voice said sternly. “I can protectmyself, I cannot protect others.”The curse Amelia shouted after him made even her own Aurors flinch.
This isn’t fair, isn’t fair, isn’t fair! There’s a limit to how many constraints you canadd to a problem before it really is impossible!Harry blocked off the useless thoughts, ignored the fatigue he wasfeeling, and forced his mind to confront the new requirements, he had tothink fast, use the adrenaline on following the chains of logic quickly andwithout hesitation, instead of wasting it on despair.

For the mission to succeed,(1) Harry would have to dispel his Patronus.(2) Bellatrix needed to be hidden from the Dementors after the Patronus was dispelled.(3) Harry needed to resist the Dementors’ drain after his Patronus wasdispelled.…If I solve this one, said Harry’s brain, I want a cookie afterward, and if youmake the problem any more difficult than this, I mean the slightest bit more difficult, I am climbing out of your skull and heading for Tahiti.Harry and his brain considered the problem.Azkaban had stood invincible for centuries, relying upon the impossibility of evading the Dementors’ gaze. So if Harry found another way tohide Bellatrix from the Dementors, it would rely on either his scientificknowledge or his realization that the Dementors were Death.Harry’s brain suggested that an obvious way to stop the Dementorsfrom seeing Bellatrix was to make her stop existing, i.e., kill her.Harry congratulated his brain on thinking outside the box and told itto continue searching.Kill her and then bring her back, came the next suggestion. Use Frigideiroto cool Bellatrix down to the point where her brain activity stops, then warm herup afterward using Thermos, just like people who fall into very cold water can besuccessfully revived half-an-hour later without noticeable brain damage.Harry considered this. Bellatrix might not survive in her debilitatedstate. And it might not stop Death from seeing her. And he’d have troublecarrying a cold unconscious Bellatrix very far. And Harry couldn’t remember the research on which exact body temperature was supposed to benonfatal but temporarily-brain-halting.It was another good outside-the-box idea, but Harry told his brain tokeep thinking of……ways to hide from Death…A frown moved over Harry’s face. He’d heard something about that,somewhere.One of the requisites for becoming a powerful wizard is an excellent memory,Professor Quirrell had said. The key to a puzzle is often something you read

twenty years ago in an old scroll, or a peculiar ring you saw on the finger of a manyou met only once…Harry focused as hard as he could, but he couldn’t remember, it wason the tip of his tongue but he couldn’t remember; so he told his subconscious to go on trying to recollect it, and refocused his attention on theother half of the problem.How can I protect myself from the Dementors without a Patronus Charm?The Headmaster had been repeatedly exposed to a Dementor from afew steps away, over and over throughout a whole day, and had come outof it looking merely tired. How had the Headmaster done that? CouldHarry do it too?It could just be some random genetic thing, in which case Harry wasscrewed. But assuming the problem was solvable…Then the obvious answer was that Dumbledore wasn’t afraid of death.Dumbledore really wasn’t afraid of death. Dumbledore honestly, trulybelieved that death was the next great adventure. Believed it in his core,not just as convenient words used to suppress cognitive dissonance, notjust pretending to be wise. Dumbledore had decided that death was thenatural and normative order, and whatever tiny lingering fear was still inhim, it had taken a long time and repeated exposures for the Dementorto drain him through that small flaw.That avenue was closed to Harry.And then Harry thought of the flip side, the obvious inverse question:Why am I so much more vulnerable than average? Other students didn’t fallover when they faced the Dementor.Harry meant to destroy Death, to end it if he could. He meant to liveforever, if he could; he had hope of it, the thought of Death brought himno sense of despair or inevitability. He was not blindly attached to hisown life; indeed it had taken an effort not to burn away all his life on theneed to protect others from Death. Why did the shadows of Death havesuch power over Harry? He would not have thought himself so afraid.Was it Harry, all along, who’d been rationalizing? Who was secretlyso afraid of death that it was twisting his own thoughts, as Harry hadaccused Dumbledore?






Harry considered this, preventing himself from flinching away. It feltuncomfortable, but…But…But uncomfortable thoughts weren’t always true, and this one didn’tsound exactly right. Like there was a grain of truth, but it wasn’t hidingwhere the hypothesis said it was—And that was when Harry realized.Oh.Oh, I understand now.The one who is afraid, is…Harry asked his dark side what it thought of death.And Harry’s Patronus wavered, dimmed, almost went out upon the instant, for that desperate, sobbing, screaming terror, an unutterable fearthat would do anything not to die, throw everything aside not to die, thatcouldn’t think straight or feel straight in the presence of that absolutehorror, that couldn’t look into the abyss of nonexistence any more thanit could have stared straight into the Sun, a blind terrified thing that onlywanted to find a dark corner and hide and not have to think about it anymore—The silver figure had darkened to moonlight, was flickering like a failing candle—It’s all right, thought Harry, it’s all right.Visualizing himself cradling his dark side like a frightened child inhis arms.It’s right and proper to be horrified, because death is horrible. You don’t haveto hide your horror, you don’t have to feel ashamed of it, you can wear it as a badgeof honor, openly in the Sun.It was strange, to feel himself split in two like this, the track of histhoughts that gave the comfort, the track of his thoughts that followedhis dark side’s incomprehension at the alienness of the ordinary Harry’sthoughts; of all the things that his dark side associated with its own fearof death, the one thing it had never expected or imagined that it mightfind, was acceptance and praise and help…You don’t have to fight alone, Harry said silently to his dark side. The restof me will back you up on this. I won’t let myself die, and I won’t let my friends die
872 *




either. Not you/I, not Hermione, not Mum or Dad, not Neville or Draco or anyone,this is the will to protect… Visualizing wings of sunlight, like the wings of thePatronus he had spread, to give shelter to that frightened child.The Patronus brightened again, the world spun around Harry or itwas his own mind that was spinning?Take my hand, Harry thought and visualized, come with me, and we willdo this thing together…There was a lurch in Harry’s mind, like his brain had taken one stepto the left, or the universe had taken one step to the right.And in a brightly lit corridor in Azkaban, the dim gas lights far outshone by the steady and unwavering light of a human-shaped Patronus,an invisible boy stood with a strange small smile on his face, shaking onlyslightly.Harry knew, somehow, that he’d just done something significant,something that went beyond just strengthening his resistance to Dementors.And more than that, he’d remembered. Thinking of Death as an anthropomorphic figure had done the trick, ironically enough. Now Harry couldremember it, what was reputed to hide someone from the gaze of Deathhimself…
In a corridor of Azkaban, a wizard’s striding legs came to an abrupt halt;for the bright silver thing that was his guide, had halted in midair, fluttering its wings in distress. The brilliant white phoenix craned its head,looking backward and forward as though confused; and then it turned toits master and shook its head in apology.Without another word, the old wizard turned and strode back the wayhe came.
Harry stood straight and upright, feeling the fear wash over him andaround him. Some tiny part of him might have been eroded a little by
873 *




the waves of emptiness that broke continually upon his unmoving stone,but his limbs were not cold, and his magic was with him. In time thosewaves might corrode him and consume him, sneaking through whatevertiny part of him still cowered before Death instead of using its fear to energize itself for battle. But that doom would take time, with the shadowsof Death far away and uncaring of him. The flaw, the crack, the fault-linethat was in him had been repaired, and the stars blazed brightly in hismind, vast and unafraid, and brilliant in the midst of cold and darkness.To anyone else’s eyes, it would have seemed that the boy stood alonein the dimly lit metal corridor, wearing that strange smile.For Bellatrix Black and the snake draped around her shoulders wereconcealed by the Cloak of Invisibility, one of the three Deathly Hallowsand reputed to hide its wearer from the gaze of Death himself. The riddlewhose answer had been lost, and which Harry had found anew.And Harry knew, now, that the concealment of the Cloak was morethan the mere transparency of Disillusionment, that the Cloak kept youhidden and not just invisible, as unseeable as were Thestrals to the unknowing. And Harry also knew that it was Thestral blood which paintedthe symbol of the Deathly Hallows on the inside of the Cloak, binding intothe Cloak that portion of Death’s power, enabling the Cloak to confrontthe Dementors on their own level and block them. It had felt like guessing, and yet a certain guess, the knowledge coming to him in the instantof solving the riddle.Bellatrix was still transparent within the Cloak, but to Harry she wasno longer hidden, he knew that she was there, as obvious to him as a Thestral. For Harry had only loaned his Cloak, not given it; and he had comprehended and mastered the Deathly Hallow that had been passed downthrough the Potter line.Harry gazed directly at the invisible woman, and said, “Can the Dementors reach you, Bella?”“No,” said the woman in a soft, wondering voice. Then, “But my Lord…you…”“If you say anything foolish, it will annoy me,” Harry said coldly. “Orare you under the impression that I would sacrifice myself for you?”
874 *




“No, my Lord,” the Dark Lord’s servant replied, sounding puzzled,and perhaps awed.“Follow,” spoke Harry’s cold whisper.And they continued their journey downward, as the Dark Lordreached into his pouch, and took a cookie, and ate it. If Bellatrix hadasked, Harry would have claimed it was for the chocolate, but she didn’task.
The old wizard strode back into the midst of the Aurors, the silver and thered-golden phoenixes now following behind.“You—” Amelia began to bellow.“They have dismissed their Patronus,” said Dumbledore. The old wizard didn’t seem to raise his voice but his calm words somehow overrodeher own. “I cannot find them now.”Amelia gritted her teeth, and put a number of scathing remarks onhold, and turned to the communications officer. “Tell the duty room toask the Dementors again if they can sense Bellatrix Black.”The communications specialist spoke to her mirror for a moment,and a few seconds later, looked up, surprised. “No—”Amelia was already cursing violently in her mind.“—but they can see someone else on the lower levels who isn’t a prisoner.”“Fine!” snapped Amelia. “Tell the Dementor that a dozen of its kindare authorized to enter Azkaban and seize whoever that is and anyone intheir company! And if they see Bellatrix Black, they’re to Kiss her immediately!”Amelia turned and glared toward Dumbledore, then, daring him toargue; but the old wizard only looked at her a bit sadly, and held his peace.
Auror McCusker finished speaking to the corpse that drifted outside thewindow, conveying the Director’s orders.
875 *




The corpse gave him a deathly smile that almost unstrung his limbs,and then floated downward.Soon after, a dozen Dementors arose from where they had drifted inthe central pit of Azkaban, and headed outward, toward the walls of thevast metal structure that towered above them.Entering through holes set into the base of Azkaban, the darkest of allcreatures began their march of horror.

876 *


arry had hoped that he’d just achieved fusion with his mysteriousdark side and would be enabled to draw on all of its benefits withnone of its drawbacks, call up the crystal clarity and indomitable will ondemand, without needing to go cold or angry.Once again, he’d overestimated how much progress he’d made. Something had happened, but Harry still had a mysterious dark side, it was stillseparate from him, and his ordinary self was still domitable. And despitethe repair work he’d done on his dark side’s fear of death, he didn’t dare godark while unshielded in Azkaban, that was tempting fate way too much.Which was unfortunate, because a bit of nondomitability would havesure come in handy about now.What made it harder was that he couldn’t slump against a wall,couldn’t break into tears, couldn’t even heave a sigh. His dear Bella waswatching him and that wasn’t the sort of thing her Dark Lord would do.“My Lord—” Bellatrix said. Her low voice was strained. “TheDementors—they are coming—I can feel them, my Lord—”“Thank you, Bella,” said a dry voice, “I already know that.”Harry couldn’t sense the holes in the world the same way as whenhe’d been wearing the Deathly Hallow, but he could feel the empty pull


877 *




increasing in intensity. At first he’d mistaken it for the result of descending a stairwell, until he and Bellatrix had finished descending and the pullhad gone on increasing. Then decreased, as the Dementors moved awayalong the spiral, then increased as they went up another flight of stairs…There were Dementors within Azkaban itself now, and they were comingfor him. Of course they were. Harry might be resistant now, but he wasnot hidden.New requirement, Harry told his brain. Find a way of defeating Dementorsthat doesn’t invoke my Patronus Charm. Alternatively, find yet another way ofhiding someone from Dementors, besides the Cloak of Invisibility—I quit, said his brain. Find yourself another piece of computing substrate tosolve your ridiculously overconstrained problems.I mean it, thought Harry.So do I, said his brain. Put up your Patronus Charm and wait for the Aurorsto find you. Be sensible. It’s over.Give up…The sucking emptiness seemed to pull harder, as he thought it; andHarry realized what was happening, concentrated more intensely on thestars, turned his mind away from the despair—You know, observed the logical side of him, if you’re not allowed to thinkany negative thoughts because that will open your mind to the Dementors, that’sa cognitive bias too, how would you know if it actually was time to give up?A desperate sobbing scream rose up from below, words mixed in like“no” and “away”. The prisoners knew, the prisoners could feel it.The Dementors were coming.“My Lord, you—you should not risk yourself for me—take back yourCloak—”“Be silent, fool,” hissed an angry voice. “When I decide to sacrifice youI will tell you so.”She’s got a valid point, said Slytherin. You shouldn’t risk yourself for her,there’s no way her life is as valuable as yours.For an instant Harry considered sacrificing Bellatrix to save himself—And in that moment, some of the dim orange gas-light seemed to fleethe corridor, a touch of cold crept over Harry’s fingertips. And he knew,then, that to think of leaving Bellatrix to the shadows of Death, would
878 *




make him vulnerable once more. Even in the moment of making the decision, he might become unable to cast the Patronus Charm, for he wouldhave given up the thought that had saved him before.It occurred to Harry that he could still take the Cloak from Bellatrixafterward, even if he couldn’t cast the Patronus Charm; and then hehad to wrench his thoughts away from that option, focus firmly on hisdecision not to do it, or he might have just fallen over where he stood.For the whirlpool of emptiness swirling around him was now deadlystrong; there were screams coming from above, and the screams belowhad stopped.This is ridiculous, said his logical side. Rational agents shouldn’t haveto put up with this sort of censored reasoning process, all the theorems assumethat how you think doesn’t affect reality apart from your actual actions, which iswhy you’re free to choose an optimal algorithm without worrying about how yourthoughts interact with Dementors—…That is a really dumb idea, said Gryffindor. Even I think it’s a dumb ideaand I’m your Gryffindor side. You’re not seriously going to just stand there and—
“We have a fix!” shouted Ora, holding up her magic mirror as though intriumph. “The Dementor outside the inner wall pointed to level seven, Cspiral, that’s where they are!”Her Aurors were looking at her expectantly.“No,” Amelia said in a level voice. “That’s where one of them is. TheDementors still can’t find Bellatrix Black. We are not running down thereand letting her through in the confusion, and we are not dividing ourforces to be ambushed. So long as we move with caution, we can’t lose.Tell Scrimgeour and Shacklebolt to keep going down level by level, sameas before—”The old wizard was already striding forward. Amelia didn’t evenbother cursing him, this time, as once again their carefully constructed
879 *




shields parted like water and rippled gently in his wake.
Harry waited at the beginning of the corridor, just next to the stairs leading upward. Bellatrix and the snake were behind him, concealed by theDeathly Hallow that Harry had mastered; he knew, though he could notsee, that the emaciated sorceress was sitting upon the stairs, slumpedback, since Harry had withdrawn his Hover Charm to free up his mindand magic.Harry’s eyes were fixed on the far end of the corridor, next to the stairsthat led downward. Not in his mind now, but in true reality, the lightin the corridor had dimmed, the temperature had fallen. The fear thundered over him and around him like a sea whipped by hurricane winds,and the sucking emptiness had become a howling draw toward some approaching black hole.Up the stairs at the far end, floating smoothly through the dying air,came the voids, the absences, the wounds in the world.And Harry expected them to stop.With all the will and focus he could muster, Harry expected them to stop.Anticipated their stopping.Believed they would stop.…that was the idea, anyway…Harry shut down the dangerous stray thought, and expected the Dementors to halt. They had no intelligence of their own, they were just woundsin the world, their form and structure was borrowed from others’ expectations. People had been able to negotiate with them, offer them victimsin exchange for cooperation, only because they believed Dementors wouldbargain. So if Harry believed hard enough that the voids would turn andgo, they would turn and go.But the wounds in the world kept coming, the swirling fear seemedlike a solid thing now, the emptiness tearing at matter as well as mind,substance as well as spirit, you could see the metal beginning to tarnishas the holes in the world passed.




A small sound came from behind him, from Bellatrix, but she said noword, for she had been instructed to remain silent.Don’t think of them as creatures, think of them as psychosensitive objects, theycan be controlled if I can control myself—The problem was that he couldn’t control himself so easily, couldn’tmake himself believe blue was green by an act of will. Couldn’t suppressall those thoughts about how irrational it was to make yourself believesomething. How impossible it was to trick yourself into believing something if you knew that was what you were doing. All the training Harryhad given himself against self-deception was refusing to switch off nomatter how harmful it was in this unique special case—The shadows of Death crossed the halfway point of the corridor, andHarry held up his hand, fingers spread, and said in a voice of firm andconfident command, “Stop.”The shadows of Death stopped.Behind Harry, Bellatrix gave a strangled gasp, like it was being tornout of her.Harry gestured to her, the signal he had set up in advance whichmeant, repeat what you heard the Dementors say.“They say,” Bellatrix said, her voice was shaking, “they said, ‘BellatrixBlack was promised us. Tell us where she hides, and you will be spared.’”“Bellatrix?” Harry said, making his voice sound amused. “She escapeda while ago.”A moment later, Harry realized that he should have said that Bellatrix was among the Aurors in the top level, that would have caused moreconfusion—No, it was wrong to think of the Dementors as trickable, they weremerely things, they were controlled only by expectations—“They say,” Bellatrix said in a cracked voice, “they say they know you’relying.”The voids began to move forward again.Her anticipations are more solidly believed than mine; she is controlling them,unwittingly—“Don’t resist,” Harry said, pointing his wand behind him.“I, I love you, farewell, my Lord—”
881 *




“Somnium.”It had helped, strangely enough, hearing those particular awfulwords, understanding Bellatrix’s mistake; it reminded Harry why he wasfighting.“Stop,” Harry said again. Bellatrix was asleep; now only his ownwill, his own expectations rather, should control those spheres ofannihilation—But they kept on gliding forward, and Harry couldn’t stop himselffrom worrying that the previous experience had damaged his confidence,which meant that he wouldn’t be able to stop them, and as he noticedhimself thinking that, he doubted even more—he needed more time toprepare, really ought to practice controlling just one Dementor in a cagefirst—There was only a quarter of corridor now between Harry and the shadows of death, the empty winds were so strong that Harry could feel theerosion beginning in the cracks of himself.And the thought came to Harry that maybe he was wrong, maybe Dementors did have their own desires and planning capability. Or maybethey were controlled by how everyone thought they worked, not just whoever was closest to them. And in either case—Harry drew up his wand into the starting position for the PatronusCharm, and spoke.“One of your number went to Hogwarts and did not return. It nolonger exists; that Death is dead.”The Dementors halted, a dozen wounds in the world stood motionless, while the emptiness screamed around them like a deadly wind tonowhere.“Turn and go and do not speak of this to anyone, little shadows, or Iwill destroy you as well.”Harry’s fingers slid into the starting position for the Patronus Charm,and readied himself to cast it; in his mind, the Earth shone among thestars, the day side bright and blue with reflected sunlight, the night sideglimmering with the light of human cities. Harry wasn’t bluffing, wasn’ttrying to do anything tricky with his thoughts. The shadows of Death
882 *




would move forward and be annihilated, or they would depart, he wasequally ready for either…And the voids retreated back as smoothly as they came, the winds ofnothingness lessening with each meter they traversed, as they slid backdown the stairs, and departed.Whether they truly had their own pseudo-intelligence, or whetherHarry had finally succeeded in expecting them to go… that, Harry didn’tknow.But they were gone.Harry took a moment to sit down beside the unconscious Bellatrix onthe stairs, and slumped down as she was slumped, closing his eyes for amoment, only a moment, he sure as hell wasn’t planning to sleep in Azkaban, but he needed to take that moment. The Aurors would still be goingdown the stairs slowly, Harry hoped, so it wouldn’t hurt to take just fiveminutes to rest. Harry was careful to keep his thoughts positive, cheerful,my, I’ll just have some nice regenerative rest here, and then I’ll feel better, ratherthan, say, my, I’ll just collapse in emotional and physical exhaustion, becausethe Dementors hadn’t yet retreated very far.And by the way, Harry said to his brain, you’re fired.
“I found him!” cried the old wizard’s voice.Who? thought Amelia, as she turned to see Dumbledore’s return, carrying in his arms——the one sight, the one person, she would never have expected tobehold——a man in torn red robes, looking scorched like he’d fought a smallwar, blood dried on many cuts. His eyes were open, and he was chewingon a bar of chocolate, held in his one living hand.Bahry One-Hand was alive.A glad cry went up, her Aurors lowering their wands, some of themalready starting to rush forward.
883 *




“Stay on guard!” bellowed Amelia. “Check them both for Polyjuice—scan Bahry for small Animagi or traps—”
“Innervate. Wingardium Leviosa.”There was a pause. Harry sensed, though he could not quite see, thatthe invisible woman was pushing herself to her feet, and turning her headto look around. “I’m… alive…?”Harry was sorely tempted to say no, just to see what she made of that.Instead he hissed, “Don’t ask stupid questions.”“What happened?” whispered Bellatrix.And the Dark Lord gave a wild, high-pitched laugh, and said, “I scaredthe Dementors away, my dear Bella.”There was a pause. Harry wished he could see Bellatrix’s face; had hesaid the wrong thing?After a time, in a quavering voice, “Could it be, my Lord, that in yournew form, you have begun to care for me—”“No,” Harry said coldly, and turned from her (though he kept his wandon her), and began walking. “And take care that you do not offend meagain, or I will abandon you here, use or no use. Now follow, or be leftbehind; I have work to do.”Harry strode forward, not listening to the gasping sounds that camefrom behind him; he knew Bellatrix was following.…because the last thing that woman needed, the very last thing sheneeded to start thinking before the psychiatric healer began trying to deprogram her, was to believe that her Dark Lord could ever love her back.
The old wizard smoothed his silver beard contemplatively, looking atwhere Auror Bahry was being carried out of the room by two strongAurors.“Do you understand this, Amelia?”
884 *




“No,” she said simply. She suspected some trap they hadn’t yet beenable to fathom, which was why Auror Bahry was going to be kept outsidethe main party and guarded.“Perhaps,” the old wizard said at length, “whichever of their numbercan cast the Patronus Charm, is more than a simple hostage. Someonewho was tricked into this, mayhap? For whatever reason, they left yourAuror alive; let us not be the first to wield deadly curses, when we findthem—”“I see,” said the old witch in sudden realization, “that was their plan.It costs them nothing to Oblivate him and leave him alive, and makes ushesitate—” Amelia nodded decisively, and said to her people, “We carryon as before.”The old wizard sighed. “Any news from the Dementors?”“If I tell you,” Amelia snapped, “will you run off again?”“It costs you nothing, Amelia,” the old wizard said quietly, “and maysave one of your own people the fight.”Costs me nothing except my chance at vengeance—But that was nothing compared to the other, the annoying old wizardwas often right in the end, it was part of what made him so annoying.“The Dementors have ceased to answer questions about the other person they said they saw,” Amelia told him, “and they will not say why, norwhere.”Dumbledore turned to the blazing silver phoenix on his shoulder,whose light illuminated the whole corridor, and received a silent headshake in reply. “I cannot detect them either,” said Dumbledore. Then heshrugged. “I suppose I shall just walk the whole spiral from top to bottomand see if anything turns up, shall I?”Amelia would have ordered him not to do it, if she thought that wouldhave made the tiniest difference.“Albus,” said Amelia as the old wizard turned to depart, “even you canbe ambushed.”“Nonsense, my dear,” the old wizard said cheerfully as he strodeoff yet again, waving as though in admonition his fifteen-inch wand ofunidentifiable dark-grey wood, “I’m invincible.”There was a pause.
885 *




(“He didn’t just really say that—” whispered the newest Auror present,a still-prim young lady by the name of Noelle Curry, to the senior memberof her trio, Auror Brooks. “Did he?”)(“He can get away with it,” Isabel whispered back to her, “he’s Dumbledore, not even Fate takes him seriously anymore.”)“And that,” Amelia said heavily, for the benefit of the younger Aurors,“is why we never call him in on anything unless we absolutely must.”
Harry lay very still on the hard bench that served as the bed of this cell,a blanket pulled over him, staying as absolutely motionless as he couldwhile he waited for the fear to return. There was a Patronus approaching,and a powerful one. Bellatrix was hidden by a Deathly Hallow, no easyCharm would penetrate that; but Harry did not know what other arts theAurors might employ to detect his own self, and dared not reveal his ignorance by asking her. So Harry lay on a hard bed, in a cell with a lockeddoor, and the mighty metal door locked behind him, in absolute darkness,with a thin blanket pulled over him, hoping that whoever it was wouldn’tlook in, or wouldn’t look too closely if they did—That wasn’t a point Harry could affect, really, that part of his fate layentirely in the hands of the Hidden Variables. Most of his mind was concentrating on the ongoing Transfiguration he was performing.Listening in the silence, Harry heard the quick footsteps approach;they paused outside his door, and then——continued onward.Soon the fear returned.Harry didn’t allow himself to notice his own relief, any more than heallowed himself to notice the fear. He was holding in his mind the formof a Muggle device rather larger than a car battery, and slowly applyingthat Form to the substance of an ice cube (which Harry had frozen usingFrigideiro on water from a bottle in his pouch). You weren’t supposed to
886 *




Transfigure things to be burned, but between the original substance being water, and the Bubble-Head Charm to protect their air supply, Harryhoped that this wouldn’t make him or anyone else sick.Now it was just a question of whether there would be enough timebefore the Aurors did a detailed check on this cell block, for Harry to finishthis Transfiguration, and the partial Transfiguration he would do afterthat—
When the old wizard strode back empty-handed, even Amelia began tofeel a twinge of worry. She and the other two Auror teams had worked athird of the way down the three spirals, in synchrony so as not to allow anygap in their coverage that could be jumped by cutting through a ceiling,and they’d yet to find any sign.“Might I ask you to report?” Amelia said, keeping the edge out of hervoice.“First a simple walk from top to bottom,” said the old wizard. He wasfrowning, wrinkling his face even more than usual. “I examined Bellatrix’s cell, and found a death doll left in her place. This escape was meantto go unremarked, I think. There is something hidden in the corner beneath a scrap of cloth; I left that undisturbed for your Aurors to examine.On the return trip, I opened each door and looked within the cells. I sawnothing Disillusioned, only the prisoners—”They were interrupted by a scream from the red-golden phoenix, andall her Aurors flinched from it. Condemnation was in it, and an urgent demand that almost started Amelia running from the corridor on the spot.“—in rather distressing condition,” Dumbledore said quietly. Fora moment the blue eyes were very cold beneath the half-moon glasses.“Will any of you speak to me of the consequences of their actions?”“I did not—” Amelia began.“I know,” said the old wizard. “My apologies, Amelia.” He sighed.“Some of the more recent prisoners had scraps of their magic left, whenI looked upon them, but I sensed no uneaten power; the strongest hadonly as much magic left as a first-year child. I heard Fawkes scream in
887 *




distress many times, but never challenge. It seems you shall have to continue your search; they can hide well enough to escape my mere glance.”
When Harry finished his first Transfiguration, he sat up, pulled back theblanket that had covered him, cast a quick Lumos, glanced at his watch,and was shocked to see that nearly an hour and thirty minutes had passed.How much of that time had gone by since someone had opened the doorand then closed it again—Harry hadn’t been looking in that direction, ofcourse—that, Harry couldn’t guess.“My Lord…?” whispered Bellatrix’s voice, soft and very tentative.“You may speak now,” Harry said. He’d told her to remain silent whilehe worked.“That was Dumbledore who looked upon us.”Pause.“Interesting,” Harry said neutrally. He was glad he had not noticedthis at the time. That sounded like a rather close shave.Harry said a word to his pouch, and began drawing forth the magicaldevice that he would mate to the product of his hour’s labor. Then, whenthat was drawn forth, another word brought forth a tube of industrialstrength glue; before using it, Harry cast the Bubble-Head Charm on himself and Bellatrix, and had Bellatrix cast the same Charm on the snake, sothat the glue fumes in the enclosed cell would not harm them.When the glue had begun to set, binding technology to magic, Harrylaid it down upon the bed, and sat down on the floor, resting his magicand will for a moment before essaying the next Transfiguration.“My Lord…” Bellatrix said hesitantly.“Yes?” said the dry voice.“What is that device you made?”Harry thought rapidly. It seemed like a good chance to check his planswith her, under the guise of leading questions.“Consider, my dear Bella,” said Harry smoothly. “How difficult is itfor a powerful wizard to cut the walls of Azkaban?”




There was a pause, and then Bellatrix’s voice came, slow and puzzled,“Not difficult at all, my Lord…?”“Indeed,” said the dry, high voice of Bella’s master. “Suppose one wereto do this, and fly through the hole on a broomstick, and soar up and away.Rescuing a prisoner from Azkaban would seem easy then, would it not?”“But my Lord…” said Bella. “The Aurors would—they have their ownbroomsticks, my Lord, fast ones—”Harry listened, it was as he had thought. The Dark Lord replied, againin tones of smoothly Socratic inquiry, and Bellatrix asked a further question, which Harry had not expected, but Harry’s own counterquestionshowed that it should not matter in the end. And in response to Bellatrix’s last question, the Dark Lord only smiled, and said that it was timefor him to resume his work.And then Harry got up from the floor of the cell, went to the far end ofthe cells, and touched his wand to the hard surface of the wall—the wallof Azkaban, the solid metal that separated them from direct exposure tothe Dementors’ pit.And Harry began a partial Transfiguration.This spell would go faster, Harry hoped. He’d spent hours and hourspracticing the unique magic, which had made it routine, not much moredifficult for him than ordinary Transfiguration. The shape he was changing had not all that much total volume, the Transfigured shape might betall and wide and long, but it was very thin. Half a millimeter, Harry hadthought, would be enough, considering the perfect smoothness…On the long bench that served as a prison bed, where Harry had setdown the Transfigured technological device and the mated magic itemfor the glue to dry, tiny letters in golden script gleamed on the Muggleartifact. Harry hadn’t really planned for them to be there, but they’d keptrunning through the back of his mind, and so seemed to have becomepart of the Transfigured form.There were many different things Harry could have said before usingthis particular triumph of technological ingenuity. Any number of thingsthat would be, in one sense or another, appropriate. Or at least thingsthat Harry could have said, would have said, if Bellatrix had not been there.




But there was only one thing to say, that Harry would only get thechance to say just this once, and probably never get a better chance to sayever again. (Or think, anyway, if he couldn’t say it.) He hadn’t seen theactual movie, but he’d seen a preview, and for some reason the phrasehad stuck in his mind.The tiny golden letters upon the Muggle device said,All right, you primitive screwheads! Listen up!



n darkness absolute, a boy stood holding his wand to the solid metalwall of Azkaban, essaying a magic that only three other people in theworld would have believed possible, and that none save he alone couldwield.Of course a powerful wizard could’ve cut through the wall in seconds,with a gesture and a word.For an average adult it might have been a matter of a few minutes’work, and afterward they would have been winded.But to accomplish the same end as a first-year Hogwarts student, youhad to be efficient.Luckily—well, not luckily, luck had nothing to do with it—conscientiously,Harry had practiced Transfiguration for an extra hour every day, to thepoint where he was ahead of even Hermione in that one class; he’d practiced partial Transfiguration to the point where his thoughts had beguntaking the true universe for granted, so that it required only slightlymore effort to keep its timeless quantum nature in mind, even as he kepta firm mental separation between the concept of Form and the conceptof substance.And the problem with that art having become so routine…

it.



…was that Harry could think about other things while he was doing
Somehow his thoughts had managed to not go there, to not confrontthe obvious, until he was faced with the prospect of really actually doing itin just a few minutes.What Harry was about to do……was dangerous.Really dangerous.Someone-might-actually-genuinely-get-killed dangerous.Facing down twelve Dementors without a Patronus Charm had beenscary, but merely scary. Harry could have cast the Patronus Charm, wouldhave cast it as soon as he thought he was in danger of not being able todo so, as soon as he felt his resistance beginning to fail. And even if thathadn’t worked… even so, unless the Dementors had been instructed toKiss anyone they found, failure shouldn’t have been fatal.This was different.The Transfigured Muggle device could explode and kill them.The interface between the technology and the magic could fail in anynumber of ways and kill them.The Aurors could get in a lucky shot.It was just, well…Seriously dangerous.Harry had caught his mind trying to argue itself into believing that itwas safe.And sure, the whole thing could work, but…But even leaving out that rationalists weren’t ever allowed to arguethemselves into things, Harry knew he couldn’t possibly have argued himself into estimating less than a 20% probability of dying.Lose, said Hufflepuff.Lose, said the voice of Professor Quirrell in his mind.Lose, said his mental model of Hermione and Professor McGonagalland Professor Flitwick and Neville Longbottom and, well, basically everyone Harry knew except for Fred and George, who would have gone for itin a hot second.

He should just go find Dumbledore and turn himself in. He should,he really really should, it was the only sane thing to do at this point.And if it’d been only Harry on the mission, only his own life that’dbeen at stake, he would have; he surely would have.The part that was almost causing him to lose his concentration on thepartial Transfiguration he was performing, the part that was threateningto open him to the Dementors……was Professor Quirrell, still unconscious, still a snake.If Professor Quirrell went to Azkaban for his part in the escape, hewould die. He probably wouldn’t last even a week. He was that sensitive.It was that simple.If Harry lost here…He lost Professor Quirrell.Even though he’s probably evil, said the Hufflepuff part of him quietly.Even so?It wasn’t a decision that Harry had made in any conscious way. Hejust couldn’t do it. Losing was for House points, not people.If you think your own life is valuable enough that you’re not willing to takeon an eighty percent probability of dying in order to protect all the prisoners inAzkaban, his Slytherin side observed, there’s no way you can justify taking atwenty percent risk to your life to save Bellatrix and Professor Quirrell. The mathdoesn’t add up, you can’t be assigning consistent utilities over outcomes here.The logical side of him noted that Slytherin had just won the argument.Harry kept the Form in his mind, kept on casting the spell. He couldalways just abort the mission when he was done with the Transfiguration,he didn’t want to lose the effort he’d already invested.And then Harry thought of something else that suddenly made it veryhard to keep the magic going, very hard to keep up his resistance to theDementors.What if the portkey doesn’t take us where Professor Quirrell said it did?It was obvious in retrospect the moment he thought about it.Even if the planned escape went completely right, even if the Muggledevice worked and didn’t explode and didn’t interact badly with the mated
893 *




magic item, even if the Aurors didn’t get in a lucky shot, even if Harrymade it far enough away from Azkaban to use the portkey……there might not be a psychiatric healer at the end of it.That was something Harry had believed when he’d trusted ProfessorQuirrell, and he’d forgotten to re-evaluate it after Professor Quirrell wasno longer to be trusted.You can’t do this, said Hufflepuff. At this point we’re talking mere stupidity.Cold seemed to spread through the room, but Harry kept the Transfiguration going, even as his resistance against the Dementors faltered.I can’t lose Professor Quirrell.He tried to kill a police officer, said Hufflepuff. You already lost him, in thatmoment. Bellatrix is probably just what everyone thinks she is. Just take yourCloak back, go find Dumbledore and tell him you were tricked.No, thought Harry desperately, not without talking to Professor Quirrell,there might be an explanation, I don’t know, maybe he was standing far enoughaway from my Patronus that the Dementors got to him… I don’t understand, itdoesn’t make sense on any hypothesis, why he would do that… I can’t just…Harry turned his mind away from that chain of thought before it completely broke his resistance to the fear, because he couldn’t think of feeding Professor Quirrell to Dementors while staying resolved against Death,it was a cognitive impossibility.Your reasoning is artificially impaired, observed the logical part of himcalmly, find a way to unimpair it.All right, let’s just generate alternatives, Harry thought. Not choose, notweigh, certainly not commit… just think about what else I might be able to dobesides the original plan.And Harry went on cutting the hole in the wall. He was using partialTransfiguration on a thin cylindrical shell of metal, two meters in diameter and half a millimeter thick, running all the way through the wall. Hewas Transfiguring that half-millimeter thickness of metal into motor oil.Motor oil was a liquid and you weren’t to Transfigure liquids because theymight evaporate, but he and Bellatrix and the snake all had Bubble-HeadCharms. And Harry would cast Finite on the oil immediately after, dispelling his own Transfiguration…
894 *




…as soon as the separated and lubricated hunk of metal slid out of thewall and onto the floor of their cell, he’d slanted it so gravity would pull itin, once the Transfiguration was done.If Harry and Bellatrix didn’t exit on his broomstick through the resulting hole in the wall…Harry’s brain suggested that he could try to Transfigure a surfacecover over the hole in the wall, leaving a space for Bellatrix and ProfessorQuirrell to hide in, wearing the Cloak, while Harry turned himself in.And Professor Quirrell would eventually wake up, and he and Bellatrixcould try to figure out how to exit Azkaban on their own.It was, first of all, a dumb idea, and second, there would still be a hugehunk of metal on the floor of the cell, which would give it away.And then Harry’s brain saw the obvious.Let Bellatrix and Professor Quirrell use the escape route you invented. Youstay behind, and turn yourself in.Bellatrix and Professor Quirrell were the ones whose lives were atstake.They were gaining, not losing, from taking the risk.And there was no reason, no sane reason at all, for Harry to go withthem.A calm came over Harry as he thought it, the cold and darkness thathad been wavering around the fringes of his mind retreated. Yes, thatwas it, that was the creative outside-the-box route, that was the hiddenthird alternative. The falseness of the dilemma was obvious in retrospect.If Harry turned himself in, he didn’t have to turn in Bellatrix and Professor Quirrell. If Bellatrix and Professor Quirrell took a dangerous escaperoute, Harry didn’t need to go with them.Harry didn’t even need to face the embarrassment of admitting he’dbeen tricked, if he ordered Bellatrix to remove the memory. Everyonewould just assume he’d been kidnapped, including Harry himself. Admittedly, there was no plausible reason why the Dark Lord would everask Bellatrix to do that; but Harry could simply smile and tell Bellatrixshe wasn’t allowed to know, and that would be that…

Her Auror team had gotten around three-quarters of the way down Azkaban, as had the other two teams on the other two spirals. Amelia was feeling tenser already, though she was betting on the criminals hiding on thesecond-to-lowest floor, part of her wished Dumbledore had thought tocheck that specific floor more carefully and part of her was glad he hadn’t.And then there was a distant sound, like a tiny ‘tink’ noise comingfrom far away. Like a very loud sound coming from the second-to-lowestfloor, say.Amelia looked at Dumbledore before she realized, before she managed to stop herself.The old wizard shrugged, gave her a small smile, said, “Since youasked it, Amelia,” and went off yet again.
“Finite Incantatem,” Harry said to the oil coating the giant chunk of metalon the floor. He hardly heard himself speak, his ears were still ringingfrom the gigantic thud of the solid metal sliding out of the wall and falling.(He should have put up a Quieting Charm, in retrospect, though thatwouldn’t have stopped the noise from spreading through the solid metalfloor.) And then Harry said it again, “Finite Incantatem” to the oil coating the two-meter hole in the wall, spreading the effect wide; it was hisown magic Harry was canceling, which made the spell almost effortless.Harry was feeling a bit tired now, but that was the last use of magic hewould need. He hadn’t even needed to do it, really, but Harry didn’t wantto leave Transfigured liquid lying around, and he didn’t want to betraythe secret of partial Transfiguration either.It seemed very… inviting, that two-meter hole leading to freedom.The light from outside coming in… wasn’t exactly the Sun shining onhis face, but it was brighter than anything of Azkaban’s interior.Harry was tempted to just go with, just hop on the broomstick withBellatrix and the snake. Chances were that they would get out safely. Andif they did get out safely, and Harry came with, then he and Professor

Quirrell could go back in time and look perfectly innocent, everythingcould go back to normal.If Harry stayed behind and turned himself in… then even if everyoneassumed Harry had been a hostage, assumed Harry had lied to Professor McGonagall’s Patronus at wandpoint… even if Harry himself got offlightly, well…It wasn’t likely that the Defense Professor would go on teaching atHogwarts.Professor Quirrell would have reached the predestined end of his career, in February of the school year.And yes, Professor McGonagall would kill Harry, and yes, it would beslow and painful.But staying behind was the sensible, safe, sane thing to do, and Harrywas feeling more relaxed than regretful.Harry turned to Bellatrix; he opened his mouth to instruct her a finaltime—And there was a hiss, a weak hiss, a hiss that sounded slow and confused, and the hiss said,“What wass… that noisse?”
Through the corridor the old wizard strode. He came to a metal doorand opened it, already knowing from memory that the cells within wereempty.Seven mighty and discerning incantations the wizard spoke then, before he moved on; it would be little enough exertion in total, with so fewcells left to check.
“Teacher,” Harry hissed. So many emotions bubbling up in him, all at once.He knew, though he could not see, that the green snake around Bellatrix’sshoulders, was slowly lifting its head to look around. “Are you… all right,teacher?”“Teacher?” came the weak, confused hiss. “Where iss thiss?”
897 *




“Prisson,” Harry hissed, “the prisson with life-eaterss, we were to resscue awoman, you and I. You tried to sslay the protector man, I blocked your killing cursse,there was a ressonance between uss… you fell unconssciouss, I had to defeat theprotector man mysself… my guardian Charm wass disspelled, the life-eaterss couldtell the protectorss that the woman had esscaped. There iss ssomeone here who canssensse my guardian Charm, probably the sschoolmasster… so had to disspell myguardian Charm, ﬁnd different way to hide you and the woman from life-eatersswithout guardian Charm, learn to protect mysself without guardian Charm, sscareoff life-eaterss without guardian Charm, then devisse new esscape plan for you andthe woman, and ﬁnally, cut hole in thick metal wall of prisson even though I am onlyﬁrsst-year sstudent. No time to explain, you musst go now. If we never meet again,teacher, then I was glad to know you for a time, even though you are probably evil. Itiss good to have the chance to ssay thiss much: Goodbye.”And Harry took the broomstick and presented it to Bellatrix, sayingsimply, “Get on.”He had decided to keep the memories. For one thing, they were important. For another, he and the Defense Professor had started planningthis a week ago, and Harry wasn’t about to obliterate the whole last week,or explain to Bellatrix exactly what needed to be Obliviated. Harry couldprobably fool Veritaserum, and if Dumbledore insisted that Harry drophis Occlumency shields for a deeper examination… well, Harry had actedheroically throughout.“Sstop!” said the snake. Its voice was stronger now. “Sstop, sstop, sstop!What do you mean, goodbye?”“Esscape plan iss rissky,” said Harry. “My life iss not at sstake, only yourss andherss. Sso I am sstaying, turning mysself in—”“No!” said the snake. The hiss was forceful. “Musst not! Not permitted!”Bellatrix mounted the broomstick; Harry could sense (but never see)her head turning to look at him, she said no word. Awaiting him, perhaps,or merely awaiting his orders.“No longer trusst you,” Harry said simply. “Not ssince you tried to sslay theprotector man.”And the snake hissed, “I did not sseek to sslay the protector man! Are you fool,boy? Sslaying him would not make ssensse, evil or no!”




The Earth ceased to turn on its axis, paused in its orbit around theSun.The snake’s hiss was now more furious than anything Harry had everheard from the human Professor Quirrell. “Sslay him? Had I ssought to sslayhim he would have been dead within ssecondss, fool boy, he wass no match for me! Issought to ssubdue, to dominate, force him to drop sshieldss upon hiss mind, needed toread him, to know who awaited hiss reply, learn detailss for memory sspell—”“You casst killing cursse!”“Knew he would dodge!”“Wass hiss life worth sso little? What if he did not dodge?”“Would have pusshed him out of the way with own magic, fool boy!”Again the pause in the planet’s spin. Harry hadn’t thought of that.“Witlesss dunce of a plotter,” hissed the snake, so angrily that the hissesseemed to overlap and slither over each other’s tails, “clever imbecile, cunningidiot, fool of an untrained Sslytherin, your missplaced misstrust hass ruined—”“Thiss iss not a fair time to argue,” Harry observed mildly. The surge of relief trying to flood through him was canceled by the increased tension.“Ssince I cannot get angry at you properly, without opening mysself to life-eaterss.Musst russh, ssomeone may have heard noisse—”“Explain esscape plan,” the snake said imperiously. “Sswiftly!”Harry explained. Parseltongue didn’t have words for the Muggle technology, but Harry described the function and Professor Quirrell seemedto understand.There were a few short hisses, the snakish equivalent of a bark of surprised laughter, and then, snapped commands. “Tell woman to look away,casst sspell of ssilence, sset guardian Charm outside door. Will transsform mysself,make few sswift improvementss to your invention, give woman emergency potion ssosshe can sshield uss, transsform back before you disspell Charm. Plan will be ssafer,then.”“And am I to believe,” Harry hissed, “that healer for woman truly awaitss uss?”“Usse ssensse, boy! Ssupposse I am evil. To end usse of you here iss obvioussly notwhat I planned. Misssion iss target of opportunity, invented after ssaw your guardianCharm, whole affair meant to be unnoticed, hid when left eating-place. Obviousslyyou will ssee persson pretending to be healer on arrival! Go back to eating-place afterward, original plan carriess on undissturbed!”




Harry stared at the invisible snake.On the one hand, saying it like that made Harry feel rather dumb.And on the other hand, it wasn’t exactly reassuring.“Sso,” Harry hissed, “what iss your plan for me, precissely?”“You ssaid no time,” came the snake’s hiss, “but plan iss for you to rule country,obvioussly, even your young noble friend hass undersstood that by now, assk him onreturn if you wissh. Will ssay no more now, iss time to fly, not sspeak.”
The old wizard reached out toward another metal door, from behindwhich came a endless dead mutter, “I’m not serious, I’m not serious,I’m not serious…” The red-golden phoenix on his shoulder was alreadyscreaming urgently, and the old wizard was already wincing, when—Another cry pierced the corridor, phoenix-like but not the truephoenix’s call.The wizard’s head turned, looked at the blazing silver creature on hisother shoulder, even as ephemeral and substanceless talons launched thespell-entity into the air.The false phoenix flew down the corridor.The old wizard raced off after, legs churning like a spry young man ofsixty.The true phoenix screamed once, twice, and a third time, hovering before the metal door; and then, when it became clear that its master wouldnot return for all its calling, flew reluctantly after.
Professor Quirrell had assumed his true form, this time—Polyjuice onlylasted for an hour without redosing—and though the Defense Professorwas pale, leaning against the metal bars of the nearest cell, his magicwas strong enough to seize his wand without a word, even as Bellatrixdoffed the Cloak and placed it obediently in Harry’s waiting hand. Thesense of doom was building once more, though not in full force, as the




Defense Professor’s power returned, the fringes of its vast force clashingwith Harry’s slight childish aura.Harry said aloud the description of his Muggle device, naming it tothe observing wizard, and then a Finite from Harry turned all his hardwork back into an ice cube. Professor Quirrell could not cast spells onsomething Harry had Transfigured, for that would be an interaction,however slight, between their magics, but—Three seconds after, Professor Quirrell was holding his own Transfigured version of the Muggle device. A single barked word and a sweepof his wand, and the residue of glue was gone from the magical item;three more incantations later, the magical and technological were fusedtogether as though into a single thing, and Charms of Unbreakability andflawless function had been cast upon the Muggle device.(Harry felt a lot better about doing this under adult supervision.)A potion was thrown to Bellatrix, and Professor Quirrell and Harryboth commanded, “Drink,” as though speaking in the same voice. Theemaciated woman had already been lifting it to her lips, without waiting;for it was evident to anyone that this snake Animagus was a servant ofthe Dark Lord, and a powerful and trusted one.Harry finished pulling the hood of the Cloak of Invisibility over hishead.A brief and terrible magic lashed out from the Defense Professor’swand, scouring the hole in the wall, scarring the huge chunk of metal thatlay in the room’s midst; as Harry had requested, saying that the methodhe’d used might identify him.“Left-hand glove,” Harry said to his pouch, and drew it forth, and putit on.A gesture from the Defense Professor made a harness appear uponBellatrix’s shoulders, and another, smaller cloth device upon her hand,and something like handcuffs on her wrists, even as the woman finisheddrinking the potion.A strange, unhealthy color seemed to come over Bellatrix’s pale face,she straightened, her sunken eyes seemed brighter and far more dangerous……small wisps of steam were coming out of her ears…
901 *




(Harry decided not to think about that part.)…and Bellatrix Black laughed, then, sudden mad laughter that rangmuch too loudly amid the small prison cells of Azkaban.(Very soon, the Defense Professor had said, Bellatrix would fall unconscious and stay that way for quite awhile, the price of the potion she hadtaken; but for just a few moments she would regain perhaps a twentiethpart of the power she had once wielded.)The Defense Professor threw his wand toward Bellatrix, and an instant later blurred into a green snake.An instant after that the Dementors’ fear returned to the room.Bellatrix flinched only slightly, caught the wand, and gestured without a word; the snake flew up and was inserted into the harness on herback.Harry said “Up!” to the broomstick.Bellatrix attached the wand to the holster on her hand.Harry leaped onto the two-person broomstick in the lead position.Bellatrix followed behind him, she took the cufflike devices on herwrists and chained her hands to the grips of the broomstick, even asHarry’s right hand shoved his wand into his pouch.And the three shot forward through the hole in the wall——emerging into the open air, directly above the Dementors’ pit, inthe interior of the vast triangular prism that was Azkaban, the blue skynow clearly visible above them, shining down its daylight.Harry angled the broomstick and began accelerating, upward and toward the center of the triangular space. His left hand, gloved to preventdirect contact between his skin and something which Professor Quirrellhad Transfigured, held the switch of the control on the Muggle device.Far above them, distant shouts rang out.All right, you primitive screwheads!Aurors on fast racing broomsticks angled out of the sky, divingstraight down toward them, faint sparks of light already blazing downward as the first shots were fired.Listen up!“Protego Maximus!” shouted Bellatrix in a mighty, cracked voice, followed by a cackling laugh as a shimmering blue field surrounded them.
902 *




You see this?From the decaying pit in the center of Azkaban, over a hundred Dementors rose into the air, appearing to some as a great mass of corpses,a flying graveyard; appearing to another as a conglomerate of absencesthat seemed to form one vast rip in the world as they slid upward.This…The voice of an ancient and powerful wizard bellowed a terrible incantation, and a great blast of white-golden fire shot out of the hole in Azkaban’s wall, shapeless for only a moment before it began to form wings.Is…And the Aurors activated the Anti-Anti-Gravity Jinx that had beenbuilt into the wards of Azkaban, disabling all flying spells whose enchantment had not been cast with the recently changed passphrase.The lift on Harry’s broom switched off.Gravity, on the other hand, stayed on.Their broom’s upward rise slowed, started to decelerate, began theprocess of turning into a fall.My…But the enchantments that kept the broom pointed in a direction andallowed steering, the enchantments that kept the riders attached andsomewhat protected them from acceleration, those enchantments werestill functioning.Harry hit the ignition switch on the General Technics made, modelBerserker PFRC, N-class, ammonium perchlorate composite propellant,solid-fuel rocket that had been mated to his Nimbus x200 two-personbroomstick.And there was noise.



had been invented during what a Muggle would haveBroomstickscalled the Dark Ages, supposedly by a legendary witch named Celes-
tria Relevo, allegedly the great-great-granddaughter of Merlin.Celestria Relevo, or whichever person or group had really inventedthose enchantments, hadn’t known a darned thing about Newtonian mechanics.Broomsticks, therefore, worked by Aristotelian physics.They went where you pointed them.If you wanted to move straight forward, you pointed them straightforward; you didn’t worry about keeping some of the thrust going downward to cancel out the effect of gravity.If you turned a broomstick, all of its new velocity was in the new direction of pointing, it didn’t go sideways based on its old momentum.Broomsticks had maximum speeds, not maximum accelerations. Notbecause of anything to do with air resistance, but because a broomstickhad some maximum Aristotelian impetus its enchantments could exert.Harry had never explicitly noticed that before, despite being dextrousenough to get the best grades in flying class. Broomsticks worked somuch like the human mind instinctively expected them to work that his brainhad managed to entirely overlook their physical absurdity. Harry, on his firstThursday of broomstick lessons, had been distracted by more interestingseeming phenomena, words written on paper and a glowing red ball. So
905 *




his brain had simply suspended its disbelief, marked the reality of broomsticks as accepted, and proceeded to have its fun, without ever once thinking of the question whose answer would have been obvious. For it is a sadfact that we only ever think about a tiny fraction of all the phenomena weencounter…That is the story of how Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres was almostkilled by his own lack of curiosity.Because rockets did not work by Aristotelian physics.Rockets did not work like a human mind instinctively thought a flyingthing should work.A rocket-assisted broomstick, therefore, did not move like the magicalbroomsticks upon which Harry was such a very good flyer.None of this actually went through Harry’s mind at the time.For one thing, the loudest noise he’d ever heard in his life was preventing him from hearing himself think.For another thing, accelerating upward at four gravities meant thathe had around two and a half seconds, total, to go from the bottom to thetop of Azkaban.And even if they were two and a half of the longest seconds in the history of Time, that wasn’t enough room to do much thinking.There was time only to see the lights of the Aurors’ curses arrowingdown at him, slightly angle the broomstick to avoid them, realize that thebroomstick was simply continuing on with mostly the same momentuminstead of going in the direction he pointed it, and activate the wordlessconceptsandwhereupon Harry angled the broomstick much harder and then theystarted to very quickly approach the wall so he angled it back the otherway and there were more lights coming down and the Dementors weresliding smoothly up toward them along with some kind of giant wingedcreature of white-golden flame so Harry wrenched the broomstick backtoward the sky but now he was still sliding toward another wall so he tiltedthe broom slightly and he stopped approaching but he was too close so he




tilted it again and then the distant Aurors on their broomsticks weren’tvery distant at all and he was going to crash into that woman so he spunhis broomstick straight away from her and then in another instant he realized his rocket was an extremely powerful flamethrower and in a fraction of a second it would be pointing directly at the Auror so he spun thebroomstick sideways as he kept going up and he couldn’t remember if itwas pointing at any Aurors now but at least it wasn’t pointing at herHarry missed another Auror by about a meter, zipping past him ona sideways-pointed flamethrower moving upward at, Harry would laterguess, around 300 kilometers per hour.If there were any screams of roasted Aurors he didn’t hear them, butthis was not evidence one way or another, because all that Harry was hearing at the moment was an extremely loud noise.A couple of calmer if not quieter seconds later, there didn’t seem to beany Aurors around, or any Dementors, or any giant winged flame creatures, and the vast and terrible edifice of Azkaban looked surprisinglytiny from this height.Harry got the broomstick pointed toward the Sun, faintly visiblethrough the clouds, it wasn’t high in the sky at this time of day andmonth of winter, and the broomstick accelerated for another two seconds in that direction and picked up an amazing amount of speed veryquickly before the solid-fuel rocket burned itself out.After that, once Harry could hear himself think again, when therewas only the howling wind from their ridiculous speed, and Harry’senchantment-assisted fingers gripping the broomstick were merely resisting the decelerating drag of moving way faster than terminal velocity,that was when Harry actually thought all that stuff about Newtonianmechanics and Aristotelian physics and broomsticks and rocketry andthe importance of curiosity and how he was never going to do anythingthis Gryffindor ever again or at least not until after he learned the DarkLord’s secret of immortality and why had he listened to Professor Quirinus “I asssure you, boy, I would not attempt thisss if I did not anticipate my ownssurvival” Quirrell instead of Professor Michael “Son, if you try anythingto do with rockets on your own, I mean anything whatsoever without atrained professonal watching, you will die and that will make Mum sad”

Verres-Evans.
“WHAT?” shrieked Amelia at the mirror.
The wind had died down to a bearable level as the air resistance slowedthem, giving Harry plenty of opportunity to listen to the buzzing, ringingsound that seemed to fill his whole brain.Professor Quirrell had been supposed to cast a Quieting Charmon the rocket exhaust… apparently there were limits to what QuietingCharms could do… in retrospect, Harry should have Transfigured a pairof earplugs, not just trusted to the Quieting Charm, though that probablywouldn’t have been enough either…Well, magical healing probably had something to treat permanenthearing damage.No, really, magical healing probably had something to treat that.He’d seen students go to Madam Pomfrey with injuries that sounded alot worse…Is there some way of transplanting an imaginary personality to someone else’shead? asked Hufflepuff. I don’t want to live in yours anymore.Harry shoved it all into the back of his mind, there really wasn’t anything he could do about it right now. Was there anything he should beworrying about—Then Harry glanced behind him, remembering for the first time tocheck whether Bellatrix or Professor Quirrell had been blown off thebroomstick.But the green snake was still in its harness, and the emaciated womanwas still clinging to the broomstick, her face still charged with unhealthycolor and her eyes still bright and dangerous. Her shoulders were shakinglike she was laughing hysterically, and her lips were moving as though toshout, but no sound was coming out—Oh, right.




Harry took off the hood of his cloak, tapped his ears to let her knowhe couldn’t hear.Whereupon Bellatrix grasped her wand, pointed it at Harry, and suddenly the ringing in his ears diminished, he could hear her.A moment later he regretted it; the imprecations she was screamingat Azkaban, Dementors, Aurors, Dumbledore, Lucius, Bartemy Couch,something called the Order of the Phoenix, and all who stood in the wayof her Dark Lord, et cetera, were not suitable for younger and more sensitive listeners; and her laughter was hurting his newly healed ears.“Enough, Bella,” Harry finally said, and her voice stopped on the instant.There was a pause. Harry pulled the Cloak back over his head, juston general principles; and realized in the same instant that they mighthave telescopes down there or something, in retrospect pulling down hishood for even a moment had been an incredibly dumb move, he hopedthe whole mission didn’t end up failing because of that one error…We’re not really cut out for this, are we? observed Slytherin.Hey, Hufflepuff objected in sheer reflex, we can’t expect to do anythingperfectly the first time, we probably just need more practice FORGET I SAIDHarry looked back again, saw Bellatrix looking around with a puzzled,wondering look on her face. Her head kept turning, turning.And finally Bellatrix said, her voice now lower, “My Lord, where arewe?”What do you mean? was what Harry wanted to say, but the Dark Lordwould never admit to not understanding anything, so Harry replied,dryly, “We are on a broomstick.”Does she think she’s dead, that this is Heaven?Bellatrix’s hands were still chained to the broomstick, so it was only afinger that came up and pointed when she said, “What is that?”parts inside them somewhere……well, that was a nice thought but it wasn’t strictly true, there wassuch a thing as literal brain damage, people could lose genes and thecomplex machine could stop working, there were sociopaths and psychopaths, people who lacked the gear to care. Maybe Lord Voldemorthad been born like that, or maybe he had known good and yet still chosenevil; at this point it didn’t matter in the slightest. But a supermajority ofthe population ought to be capable of learning to do what Hermione andHolocaust resisters did.The people who had been run through the Milgram experiment, whohad trembled and sweated and nervously laughed as they went all theway to pressing the switches marked ‘XXX’, many of them had written tothank Milgram, afterward, for what they had learned about themselves.That, too, was part of the story, the legend of that legendary experiment.The Sun had almost sunk below the horizon now, a last golden tippeeking above the faraway tops of trees.Harry looked at it, that tip of Sun, his glasses were supposed to beproof against UV so he ought to be able to look directly at it without damaging his eyes.Harry stared directly at it, that tiny fraction of the Light that was notobscured and blocked and hidden, even if it was only 3 parts out of 40, theother 37 parts were there somewhere. The 7.5% of the glass that was full,which proved that people really did care about water, even if that forceof caring within themselves was too often defeated. If people truly didn’tcare, the glass would have been truly empty. If everyone had been likeYou-Know-Who inside, secretly cleverly selfish, there would have beenno resisters to the Holocaust at all.Harry looked at the sunset, on the second day of the rest of his life,and knew that he had switched sides.Because he couldn’t believe in it any more, he couldn’t really, not after going to Azkaban. He couldn’t do what 37 out of 40 people would votefor him to do. Everyone might have inside them what it took to be Her*

mione, and someday they might learn; but someday wasn’t now, not here,not today, not in the real world. If you were on the side of 3 out of 40 people then you weren’t a political majority, and Professor Quirrell had beenright, Harry would not bow his head in submission when that happened.There was a sort of awful appropriateness to it. You shouldn’t go toAzkaban and come back having not changed your mind about anythingimportant.So is Professor Quirrell right, then? asked Slytherin. Leaving out whetherhe’s good or evil, is he right? Are you, to them, whether they know it or not, theirnext Lord? We’ll just leave out the Dark part, that’s him being cynical again. Butis it your intention now to rule? I’ve got to say, that makes even me nervous.Do you think you can be trusted with power? said Gryffindor. Isn’t theresome sort of rule that people who want power shouldn’t have it? Maybe we shouldmake Hermione the ruler instead.Do you think you’re fit to run a society and not have it collapse into total chaosinside of three weeks flat? said Hufflepuff. Imagine how loudly Mum wouldscream if she’d heard you’d been elected Prime Minister, now ask yourself, are yousure she’s wrong about that?Actually, said Ravenclaw, I have to point out that all this political stuffsounds overwhelmingly boring. How about if we leave all the electioneering toDraco and stick to science? It’s what we’re actually good at, and that’s been knownto improve the human condition too, y’know.Slow down, thought Harry at his components, we don’t have to decideeverything right now. We’re allowed to ponder the problem as fully as possiblebefore coming to a solution.The last part of the Sun sank below the horizon.It was strange, this feeling of not quite knowing who you were, whichside you were on, of having not already made up your mind about somethingas major as that, there was an unfamiliar sensation of freedom in it…And that reminded him of what Professor Quirrell had said to his lastquestion, which reminded him of Professor Quirrell, which made it hardonce more to breathe, started that burning sensation in Harry’s throat,sent his thoughts around that loop of the climbing spiral once again.Why was he so sad, now, whenever he thought of Professor Quirrell?Harry was used to knowing himself, and he didn’t know why he felt so




sad…It felt like he’d lost Professor Quirrell forever, lost him in Azkaban,that was how it felt. As surely as if the Defense Professor had been eatenby Dementors, consumed in the empty voids.Lost him! Why did I lose him? Because he said Avada Kedavra and there wasin fact a perfectly good reason even though I didn’t see it for a couple of hours? Whycan’t things go back to the way they were?But then it hadn’t been the Avada Kedavra. That might have played apart in irreversibly collapsing a structure of rationalizations and flinchesand carefully not thinking about certain things. But it hadn’t been theAvada Kedavra, that hadn’t been the disturbing thing that Harry hadseen.What did I see…?Harry looked at the fading sky.He’d seen Professor Quirrell turn into a hardened criminal while facing the Auror, and the apparent change of personalities had been effortless, and complete.Another woman had known the Defense Professor as ‘Jeremy Jaffe’.How many different people are you, anyway?I cannot say that I bothered keeping count.You couldn’t help but wonder……whether ‘Professor Quirrell’ was just one more name on the list, justone more person that had been turned into, made up in the service of someunguessable goal.Harry would always be wondering now, every time he talked to Professor Quirrell, if it was a mask, and what motive was behind that mask.With every dry smile, Harry would be trying to see what was pulling thelevers on the lips.Is that how other people will start thinking of me, if I get too Slytherin? If Ipull off too many plots, will I never be able to smile at anyone again, without themwondering what I really mean by it?Maybe there was some way to restore a trust in surface appearances and make a normal human relationship possible again, but Harrycouldn’t think of what it might be.




That was how Harry had lost Professor Quirrell, not the person, butthe… connection…Why did that hurt so much?Why did it feel so lonely, now?Surely there were other people, maybe better people, to trust and befriend? Professor McGonagall, Professor Flitwick, Hermione, Draco, notto mention Mum and Dad, it wasn’t like Harry was alone…Only…A choking sensation grew in Harry’s throat as he understood.Only Professor McGonagall, Professor Flitwick, Hermione, Draco,they all of them sometimes knew things that Harry didn’t, but…They did not excel above Harry within his own sphere of power; suchgenius as they possessed was not like his genius, and his genius was notlike theirs; he might look upon them as peers, but not look up to them ashis superiors.None of them had been, none of them could ever be…Harry’s mentor…That was who Professor Quirrell had been.That was who Harry had lost.And the manner in which he had lost his first mentor might or mightnot allow Harry to ever get him back. Maybe someday he would knowall Professor Quirrell’s hidden purposes and the doubts between themwould go away; but even if that seemed possible, it didn’t seem very probable.There was a gust of wind, outside Hogwarts, it bent the empty trees,rippled the lake whose heart was still unfrozen, made a whisperingsound as it slid past the window that looked upon the half-twilit world,and Harry’s thoughts wandered outward for a time.Then returned inward again, to the next step of the spiral.Why am I different from the other children my age?If Professor Quirrell’s answer to that had been an evasion, then itwas a very well-calculated one. Deep enough and complex enough, sufficiently full of suggestions of hidden meaning, to serve as a trap for aRavenclaw who couldn’t be diverted by less. Or maybe Professor Quirrell




had meant his answer honestly. Who knew what motive might havepulled that lever on those lips?I will say this much, Mr. Potter: You are already an Occlumens, and I thinkyou will become a perfect Occlumens before long. Identity does not mean, to suchas us, what it means to other people. Anyone we can imagine, we can be; and thetrue difference about you, Mr. Potter, is that you have an unusually good imagination. A playwright must contain his characters, he must be larger than them inorder to enact them within his mind. To an actor or spy or politician, the limit ofhis own diameter is the limit of who he can pretend to be, the limit of which face hemay wear as a mask. But for such as you and I, anyone we can imagine, we canbe, in reality and not pretense. While you imagined yourself a child, Mr. Potter,you were a child. Yet there are other existences you could support, larger existences, if you wished. Why are you so free, and so great in your circumference,when other children your age are small and constrained? Why can you imagineand become selves more adult than a mere child of a playwright should be ableto compose? That I do not know, and I must not say what I guess. But what youhave, Mr. Potter, is freedom.If that was a snow job it was one heck of a distracting one.And the still more worrisome thought was that Professor Quirrellhadn’t realized how disturbed Harry would be, how wrong that speechwould sound to him, how much damage it would do to his trust inProfessor Quirrell.There ought to always be one real person who you truly were, at thecenter of everything…Harry stared out at the falling night, the gathering darkness.…right?
It was almost bedtime when Hermione heard the scattered intakes ofbreath and looked up from her copy of Beauxbatons: A History to seethe missing boy, the boy who had been misplaced at lunch that Sunday,whose dinner nonappearance had been accompanied by rumors—andshe hadn’t believed them because they were completely ridiculous, but she’d




felt a little queasiness inside—that he’d withdrawn from Hogwarts inorder to hunt down Bellatrix Black.“Harry!” she shrieked, she didn’t even realize that she was talking directly to him for the first time in a week, or notice how some other students started at the sound of her yelling all the way across the Ravenclawcommon room.Harry’s eyes had already lifted to her, he was already walking towardher, so she stopped halfway out of her chair—A few moments later, Harry was seated across from her, and he wasputting away his wand after casting a Quieting barrier around them.(And an awful lot of Ravenclaws were trying not to look like they werewatching.)“Hey,” Harry said. His voice wavered. “I missed you. You’re… goingto talk to me again, now?”Hermione nodded, she just nodded, she couldn’t think of what to say.She’d missed Harry too, but she was realizing, with a guilty sort of feeling,that it might’ve been a lot worse for him. She had other friends, Harry… itdidn’t feel fair, sometimes, that Harry talked to only her like that, so thatshe had to talk to him; but Harry had a look about him like unfair thingshad been happening to him, too.“What’s been going on?” she said. “There’s all sorts of rumors. Therewere people saying you’d run off to fight Bellatrix Black, there were people saying you’d run off to join Bellatrix Black—” and those rumors hadsaid that Hermione had just made up the thing about the phoenix, andshe’d yelled that the whole Ravenclaw common room had seen it, so thenthe next rumor had claimed she’d made up that part too, which was stupidity of such an inconceivable level that it left her completely flabbergasted.“I can’t talk about it,” Harry said in a bare whisper. “Can’t talk abouta lot of it. I wish I could tell you everything,” his voice wavered, “but Ican’t… I guess, if it helps or anything, I’m not going to lunch with Professor Quirrell any more…”Harry put his hands over his face, then, covering his eyes.Hermione felt the queasy feeling all through her stomach.“Are you crying?” said Hermione.




“Yeah,” said Harry, his voice sounding a little breathy. “I don’t wantanyone else to see.”There was a little silence. Hermione wanted to help but she didn’tknow what to do about a boy crying, and she didn’t know what was happening; she felt like huge things were happening around her—no, aroundHarry—and if she knew what they were she would probably be scared, oralarmed, or something, but she didn’t know anything.“Did Professor Quirrell do something wrong?” she said at last.“That’s not why I can’t go to lunch with him any more,” Harry said,still in that bare whisper with his hands pressed over his eyes. “That wasthe Headmaster’s decision. But yeah, Professor Quirrell said some thingsto me that made me trust him less, I guess…” Harry’s voice sounded veryshaky. “I’m feeling kind of alone right now.”Hermione put her hand on her cheek where Fawkes had touched heryesterday. She’d kept thinking about that touch, over and over, maybebecause she wanted it to be important, to mean something to her…“Is there any way I can help?” she said.“I want to do something normal,” Harry said from behind his hands.“Something very normal for first-year Hogwarts students. Somethingeleven-year-olds and twelve-year-olds like us are supposed to do. Like playa game of Exploding Snap or something… I don’t suppose you have thecards or know the rules or anything like that?”“Um… I don’t know the rules, actually…” said Hermione. “I know theyexplode.”“I don’t suppose Gobstones?” said Harry.“Don’t know the rules and they spit at you. Those are boy games,Harry!”There was a pause. Harry ground his hands against his face to wipeit, and then took his hands away; and then he was looking at her, looking a little helpless. “Well,” Harry said, “what do wizards and witches ourage do, when they play, you know, the kind of pointless silly games we’resupposed to play at this age?”“Hopscotch?” said Hermione. “Jump-rope? Unicorn attack? I don’tknow, I read books!”




Harry started laughing, and Hermione started giggling along withhim even though she didn’t know quite why, but it was funny.“I guess that helped a little,” said Harry. “Actually I think it helpedmore than playing Gobstones for an hour could’ve possibly helped, sothanks for being you. And no matter what, I’m not having anyone Obliviate everything I know about calculus. I’d sooner die.”“What?” said Hermione. “Why—why would you ever want to do that?”Harry stood up from the table, and there was a rush of restored background noise as his rise broke the Quieting Charm. “I’m a tad sleepy soI’m going off to bed,” Harry said, now his voice was ordinary and wry,“I’ve got some lost time to make up for, but I’ll see you at breakfast, andthen at Herbology, if that’s all right. Not to mention it wouldn’t be fair todump all my depression on you. G’night, Hermione.”“Good night, Harry,” she said, feeling very confused and alarmed.“Pleasant dreams.”Harry stumbled a little as she said that, and then he continued on toward the stairs that led to the first-year-boys’ dorms.
Harry turned the Quieting Charm all the way up, on the head of his bedboard, so that he wouldn’t wake anyone else up if he screamed.Set his alarm to wake him up for breakfast (if he wasn’t up already bythat hour, if indeed he slept at all).Got into bed, laid down——felt the lump beneath his pillow.Harry stared up at the canopy above his bed.Hissed under his breath, “Oh, you’ve got to be kidding me…”It took a few seconds before Harry could muster the heart to sit upin bed, pull the blanket over himself and his pillow to obscure the deedfrom the other boys, cast a low-intensity Lumos and see what was underhis pillow.There was a parchment, and a deck of playing cards.The parchment read,




A little bird told me that Dumbledore has shut the door of your cage.I must admit, on this occasion, that Dumbledore may have a point.Bellatrix Black is loosed upon the world once more, and that is not goodnews for any good person. If I stood in Dumbledore’s place, I might welldo the same.But just in case… The Salem Witches’ Institute in America acceptsboys as well, despite the name. They are good people and would protectyou even from Dumbledore, if you needed it. Britain holds that you needDumbledore’s permission to emigrate to magical America, but magicalAmerica disagrees. So in the final extremity, get outside the wards of Hogwarts and tear in half the King of Hearts from this deck of cards.That you should resort to it only in the final extremity goes withoutsaying.Be well, Harry Potter.—Santa ClausHarry stared down at the pack of cards.It couldn’t take him anywhere else, not right now, portkeys didn’t workhere.But he still felt unnerved about the prospect of picking it up, even tohide it inside his trunk…Well, he’d already picked up the parchment, which could just as easilyhave been enchanted with a trap, if a trap was involved.But still.“Wingardium Leviosa,” Harry whispered, and Hovered the packet ofcards to lie next to where his alarm clock rested in a pocket of the headboard. He’d deal with it tomorrow.And then Harry lay back in bed, and closed his eyes, to dream withoutany phoenix to protect him, and pay his reckoning.
He came awake with a gasp of horror, not a scream, he’d yet to scream thisnight, but his blanket was all tangled around him from where his sleeping




form had jerked as he dreamed of running, trying to get away from thegaps in space that were pursuing him through a corridor of metal lit bydim gaslight, an endlessly long corridor of metal lit by dim gaslight, andhe hadn’t known, in the dream, that touching those voids meant he woulddie horribly and leave his still-breathing body empty behind him, all he’dknown was that he had to run and run and run from the wounds in theworld sliding after him—Harry started to cry again, it wasn’t for the horror of the chase, it wasthat he’d run away while someone behind him was screaming for help,screaming for him to come back and save her, help her, she was beingeaten, she was going to die, and in the dream Harry had run away insteadof helping her.“DON’T GO!” The voice came in a scream from behind the metal door.“No, no, no, don’t go, don’t take it away, don’t don’t don’t—”Why had Fawkes ever rested on his shoulder? He’d walked away.Fawkes should hate him.Fawkes should hate Dumbledore. He’d walked away.Fawkes should hate everyone—The boy wasn’t awake, wasn’t dreaming, his thoughts were jumbledand confused in the shadowlands that bordered sleep and waking, unprotected by the safety rails that his aware mind imposed on itself, the careful rules and censors. In that shadowland his brain had woken up enoughto think, but something else was too sleepy to act; his thoughts ran freeand wild, unconstrained by his self-concept, his waking self’s ideals ofwhat he shouldn’t think. That was the freedom of his brain’s dreams, ashis self-concept slept. Free to repeat, over and over, Harry’s new worstnightmare:“No, I didn’t mean it, please don’t die!”“No, I didn’t mean it, please don’t die!”“No, I didn’t mean it, please don’t die!”A rage grew in him alongside the self-loathing, a terrible hot wrath /icy cold hatred, for the world which had done that to her / for himself, andin his half-awake state Harry fantasized escapes, fantasized ways out ofthe moral dilemma, he imagined himself hovering above the vast triangular horror of Azkaban, and whispering an incantation unlike any syllables




that had ever been heard before on Earth, whispers that echoed all the wayacross the sky and were heard on the other side of the world, and therewas a blast of silver Patronus fire like a nuclear explosion that tore apartall the Dementors in an instant and ripped apart the metal walls of Azkaban, shattered the long corridors and all the dim orange lights, and then amoment later his brain remembered that there were people in there, andrewrote the half-dream fantasy to show all the prisoners laughing as theyflew away in flocks from the burning wreck of Azkaban, the silver lightrestoring the flesh to their limbs as they flew, and Harry started cryingharder into his pillow, because he couldn’t do it, because he wasn’t God—He’d sworn upon his life and magic and his art as a rationalist, he’dsworn by all he held sacred and all his happy memories, he’d given hisoath so now he had to do something, had to do something, had to DOMaybe it was pointless.Maybe trying to follow rules was pointless.Maybe you just burned down Azkaban however.And in fact he’d sworn he’d do it, so now that was what he had to do.He’d just do whatever it took to get rid of Azkaban, that was all. Ifthat meant ruling Britain, fine, if that meant finding a spell to whisperthat would echo all across the sky, whatever, the important thing was todestroy Azkaban.That was the side he was on, that was who he was, so there, it wasdone.His waking mind would have demanded a lot more details beforeaccepting that as an answer, but in his half-dreaming state it felt likeenough of a resolution to let his tired mind fall truly asleep again, anddream the next nightmare.






Final Aftermath:She came awake with a gasp of horror, a disruption of her breathingthat left her feeling deprived of air and yet her lungs didn’t move, shewoke up with an unvoiced scream on her lips and no words, no wordscame forth, for she could not understand what she had seen, she could notunderstand what she had seen, it was too large for her to encompass and stilltaking shape, she could not put words to that formless shape and so shecould not discharge it, could not discharge it and become innocent andunknowing once more.“What time is it?” she whispered.Her golden jeweled alarm clock, the beautiful and magical and expensive alarm clock that the Headmaster had given her as a gift upon heremployment at Hogwarts, whispered back, “Around two in the morning.Go back to sleep.”Her sheets were soaked in sweat, her nightclothes soaked in sweat,she took her wand from beside the pillow and cleaned herself up beforeshe tried to go back to sleep, she tried to go back to sleep and eventuallysucceeded.Sybill Trelawney went back to sleep.



ermione Granger had read somewhere once, that one of the keys tostaying thin was to pay attention to the food you ate, to notice yourself eating it, so that you were satisfied with the meal. This morning she’dmade herself toast, and put butter on the toast, and cinnamon on the butter, and it really should’ve been enough to get her to notice, this time, thegoodness that was in front of her…Without noticing the cinnamon or the butter, without noticing thefood or that she was eating, Hermione swallowed another bite of toast,and said, “Can you try explaining that again? I’m still completely flabbergasted.”“It’s pretty straightforward, if you think like a Light-Side Slytherin,”said the boy that everyone else in school, excepting only the two of them,now believed to be her true love. Harry Potter’s spoon absentmindedlystirred his breakfast cereal; he hadn’t taken many bites of it this morning,not that Hermione had seen. “Every good thing in the world brings itsown opposition into existence. Phoenixes are no exception.”Hermione took another unnoticed bite out of her buttered and cinnamoned toast, and said, “How can anyone not understand that Fawkesthinks you’re a good enough person to ride around on your shoulder? Hewouldn’t do that with a Dark Wizard! He just wouldn’t!”And she hadn’t yelled at anyone about Fawkes’s touch on her owncheek, because she knew it wouldn’t be right—that if a phoenix touchedyou, you weren’t supposed to brag about it, that wasn’t what a phoenixwas for.But she’d really hoped that it would squash the rumors about HarryPotter going evil and Hermione Granger following him down.






And it hadn’t.And she truly couldn’t understand why not.Harry ate another bite of his cereal, his eyes going distant now, nolonger meeting her own. “Think of it this way: You skip school one day,and you lie and tell your teacher you were sick. The teacher tells you tobring a doctor’s note, so you forge one. The teacher says she’s going tocall the doctor to check, so you have to give her a fake number for thedoctor, and get a friend to pretend to be the doctor when she calls—”“You did what?”Harry looked up from his cereal then, and now he was smiling. “I’mnot saying I really did that, Hermione…” Then his eyes abruptly droppedback down to his cereal. “No. Just an example. Lies propagate, that’s whatI’m saying. You’ve got to tell more lies to cover them up, lie about everyfact that’s connected to the first lie. And if you kept on lying, and you kepton trying to cover it up, sooner or later you’d even have to start lying aboutthe general laws of thought. Like, someone is selling you some kind of alternative medicine that doesn’t work, and any double-blind experimentalstudy will confirm that it doesn’t work. So if someone wants to go on defending the lie, they’ve got to get you to disbelieve in the experimentalmethod. Like, the experimental method is just for merely scientific kindsof medicine, not amazing alternative medicine like theirs. Or a good andvirtuous person should believe as strongly as they can, no matter whatthe evidence says. Or truth doesn’t exist and there’s no such thing as objective reality. A lot of common wisdom like that isn’t just mistaken, it’santi-epistemology, it’s systematically wrong. Every rule of rationality thattells you how to find the truth, there’s someone out there who needs youto believe the opposite. If you once tell a lie, the truth is ever after yourenemy; and there’s a lot of people out there telling lies—” Harry’s voicestopped.“What does that have to do with Fawkes?” she said.Harry withdrew his spoon from his cereal, and pointed in the direction of the Head Table. “The Headmaster has a phoenix, right? And he’sChief Warlock of the Wizengamot? So he’s got political opponents, likeLucius. Now, d’you think that opposition is going to just roll over andsurrender, because Dumbledore has a phoenix and they don’t? Do you




think they’ll admit that Fawkes is even evidence that Dumbledore’s a goodperson? Of course not. They’ve got to invent something to say that makesFawkes… not important. Like, phoenixes only follow people who chargestraight at anyone they think is evil, so having a phoenix just means you’rean idiot or a dangerous fanatic. Or, phoenixes just follow people whoare pure Gryffindor, so Gryffindor they don’t have the virtues of otherHouses. Or it just shows how much courage a magical animal thinks youhave, nothing else, and it wouldn’t be fair to judge politicians based onthat. They have to say something to deny the phoenix. I bet Lucius didn’teven have to make up anything new. I bet it had all been said before, centuries ago, since the first time someone had a phoenix riding on his shoulder, and someone else wanted people not to take that into account as evidence. I bet by the time Fawkes came along it was already common wisdom, it would have just seemed strange to take into account who a phoenixliked or disliked. It would be like a Muggle newspaper testing politicalcandidates to rate their level of scientific literacy. Every force for Goodthat exists in this universe, there’s someone else who benefits from people discounting it, or fencing it into a narrow box where it can’t get tothem.”“But—” Hermione said. “Okay, I see why Lucius Malfoy doesn’t wantanyone to think that Fawkes matters, but why does anyone who isn’t a badguy believe it?”Harry Potter gave a little shrug. His spoon dropped back into his cereal, and went on stirring without a pause. “Why does any kind of cynicism appeal to people? Because it seems like a mark of maturity, of sophistication, like you’ve seen everything and know better. Or becauseputting something down feels like pushing yourself up. Or they don’thave a phoenix themselves, so their political instinct tells them there’sno advantage to be gained from saying nice things about phoenixes. Orbecause being cynical feels like knowing a secret truth that common people don’t know…” Harry Potter looked in the direction of the Head Table,and his voice dropped until it was almost a whisper. “I think maybe that’swhat he’s getting wrong—that he’s cynical about everything else, but notabout cynicism itself.”Without thinking, Hermione looked in the direction of the Head Ta*

ble herself, but the Defense Professor’s seat was still empty, as it had beenon Monday and Tuesday; the Deputy Headmistress had pronounced, earlier, that Professor Quirrell’s classes for today would be canceled.Afterward, when Harry had eaten a few bites of treacle tart and thenleft the table, Hermione looked at Anthony and Padma, who had been coincidentally eating nearby but certainly not eavesdropping or anything.Anthony and Padma looked back at her.Padma said hesitantly, “Is it just me, or has Harry Potter started talking like a more complicated sort of book in the last few days? I mean, Ihaven’t been listening to him very long—”“It’s not just you,” said Anthony.Hermione didn’t say anything, but she was becoming increasinglyworried. Whatever had happened to Harry Potter on the day of thephoenix, it had changed him; there was something new in him now.Not cold, but hard. Sometimes she caught him staring out a window atnothing visible, a look of grim determination on his face. In Herbologyclass on Monday, a Venus Fire Trap had gone out of control; and Harryhad tackled Terry out of the way of a fireball even as Professor Sprouthad shouted a Flame-Freezing Charm; and when Harry had risen fromthe floor he’d just gone back to his place like nothing interesting had happened. And when for once she’d gotten a better test score than Harry intheir Transfiguration exam, later that same Monday, Harry had smiledat her as though to congratulate her, instead of gritting his teeth; and…that had bothered her a lot.She was getting the sense that Harry……was pulling away from her…“He seems a lot older all of a sudden,” said Anthony. “Not like a realgrownup, I can’t imagine Harry as a grownup, but it’s like he suddenlyturned into a fourth-year version of… of whatever he is.”“Well,” Padma said. She daintily dabbed a chocolate-flavored sconewith some scone-flavored frosting. “I think Dragon and Sunshine hadbetter ally during the next battle or Mr. Harry Potter is going to smash us.We were allied last time, and even then Chaos almost won—”“Yeah,” said Anthony. “You’re right, Miss Patil. Tell the Dragon General that we want to meet with you—”
1012 *




“No!” said Hermione. “We shouldn’t have to gang up on General Potter just to stand a chance. That doesn’t make sense, especially now thatnobody can use Muggle things anymore. It’s still twenty-four soldiers inevery army.”Neither Padma or Anthony said anything to that.
Knock-knock, knock-knock.“Come in, Mr. Potter,” she said.The door creaked open, and Harry Potter slipped through the opening into her office; he pushed the door shut behind him with one hand,and wordlessly seated himself in the cushioned chair that now stood infront of her desk. She’d Transfigured that chair so often that it sometimes changed form to reflect her mood, without any wand movement orincantation or even conscious intent. Right now, that chair had becomedeeply cushioned, so that as Harry sat down he sank into it, as though thechair were hugging him.Harry didn’t seem to notice. There was an air of quiet determinationabout the boy; his eyes had locked steadily with hers, and not let up for amoment. “You called me?” said the boy.“I did,” said Professor McGonagall. “I have two pieces of good newsfor you, Mr. Potter. First—have you met Mr. Rubeus Hagrid, at all? Thegroundskeeper? He was an old friend of your parents.”Harry hesitated. Then, “Mr. Hagrid spoke to me a bit after I got here,”Harry said. “I think it was on Tuesday of my first week of school. Hedidn’t say he knew my parents, though. At the time I thought he justwanted to introduce himself to the Boy-Who-Lived… did he have somekind of hidden agenda? He didn’t seem like the type…”“Ah…” she said. It took her a moment to pull her thoughts together.“It’s a long story, Mr. Potter, but Mr. Hagrid was falsely accused of murdering a student, five decades ago. Mr. Hagrid’s wand was snapped, andhe was expelled. Later, when Professor Dumbledore became Headmaster, he gave Mr. Hagrid a place here as Keeper of Grounds and Keys.”




Harry’s eyes watched her intently. “You said that five decades ago wasthe last time a student died in Hogwarts, and you were certain that fivedecades ago was the last time someone heard the Sorting Hat’s secretmessage.”She felt a slight chill—even the Headmaster or Severus might nothave made that connection that quickly—and said, “Yes, Mr. Potter.Someone opened the Chamber of Secrets, but this was not believed, andMr. Hagrid was blamed for the resulting death. However, the Headmaster has located the additional enchantment on the Sorting Hat, and hehas shown it to a special panel of the Wizengamot. As a result, Mr. Hagrid’s sentence has been revoked—just this morning, in fact—and hewill be allowed to acquire a new wand.” She hesitated. “We… have not yettold Mr. Hagrid of this, Mr. Potter. We were waiting until the deed wasdone, so as not to give him false hope after so long. Mr. Potter… we werewondering if we could tell Mr. Hagrid that it was you who helped him…?”She saw the weighing look in his eyes—“I remember Mr. Hagrid holding you when you were a baby,” she said.“I think he would be very happy to know.”She could see it, though, on Harry’s face, the moment when he decided that Rubeus wouldn’t be any use to him.Harry shook his head. “Bad enough that someone might deduce therewas a Parselmouth in this year’s crop of students,” Harry said. “I think it’dbe more prudent to just keep it all as secret as possible.”She remembered James and Lily, who’d never hesitated to return thefriendship the huge, bluff man had offered them, for all that James wasthe scion of a wealthy House or Lily a budding Charms Mistress, andRubeus a mere half-giant whose wand had been snapped…“Because you don’t expect him to prove useful, Mr. Potter?”There was silence. She hadn’t intended to say that out loud.Sadness crossed Harry’s face. “Probably,” Harry said quietly. “But Idon’t think he and I would get along, do you?”Something seemed to be stuck in her throat.“Speaking of making use of people,” Harry said. “It seems I’m goingto be thrown into a war with a Dark Lord sometime soon. So while I’m inyour office, I’d like to ask that my sleep cycle be extended to thirty hours




per day. Neville Longbottom wants to start practicing dueling, there’s anolder Hufflepuff who offered to teach him, and they invited me to join.Plus there’s other things I want to learn too—and if you or the Headmaster think I should study anything in particular, in order to become a powerful wizard when I grow up, let me know. Please direct Madam Pomfreyto administer the appropriate potion, or whatever it is that she needs todo—”“Mr. Potter!”Harry’s eyes gazed directly into her own. “Yes, Minerva? I know itwasn’t your idea, but I’d like to survive the use the Headmaster’s makingof me. Please don’t be an obstacle to that.”It almost broke her. “Harry,” she whispered in a bare voice, “childrenshouldn’t have to think like that!”“You’re right, they shouldn’t,” Harry said. “A lot of children have togrow up too early, though, not just me; and most children like that wouldprobably trade places with me in five seconds. I’m not going to pity myself, Professor McGonagall, not when there are people out there in realtrouble and I’m not one of them.”She swallowed, hard, and said, “Mr. Potter, at thirty hours per day,you’ll—get older, you’ll age faster—” Like Albus.“And in my fifth year I’ll be around the same physiological age as Hermione,” said Harry. “Doesn’t seem that terrible.” There was a wry smilenow on Harry’s face. “Honestly, I’d probably want this even if there weren’ta Dark Lord. Wizards live for a while, and either wizards or Muggles willprobably push that out even further over the next century. There’s no reason not to pack as many hours into a day as I can. I’ve got things I plan todo, and ‘twere well they were done quickly.”There was a long pause.“All right,” Minerva said. It came out as almost a whisper. She raisedher voice. “All right, Mr. Potter, I shall ask the Headmaster, and if heagrees, it shall be done.”Harry’s eyes narrowed for a moment. “I see. Then please remind theHeadmaster that Godric Gryffindor, in his last words, said that if it hadbeen the right thing for him to do, then he wouldn’t tell anyone else tochoose wrongly, not even the youngest student in Hogwarts.”

And she knew with a hollow feeling that any chance of Albus stopping this, stopping any of this, had just Vanished into nothingness. Thatwas what Albus had told her when she’d objected that Cameron Edwardwas too young, and then when she’d objected that Peter Pevensie was tooyoung, and finally she’d given up objecting. “Who told you that, Mr. Potter?” Not Albus—surely Albus would never say that to any student—“I’ve been doing a lot of reading lately,” Harry said. His body started torise from the enveloping chair, then halted. “Dare I ask about the secondpiece of good news?”“Oh,” she said. “Ah—Professor Quirrell has woken up and says thatyou may—”
The Hogwarts infirmary was a brilliantly open space, skylit on all foursides despite seeming to be located squarely in the middle of the castle.White beds in long rows stretched out, only three of them occupied atthe moment. One older boy and one older girl on opposite sides, bothlying motionless with their eyes closed, probably unconscious and spellbound while some healing Charm or Potion reconfigured their bodiesin uncomfortable ways; and the third occupant had the curtain drawnaround their bed, which was presumably a good thing. Madam Pomfrey had pushed him along with a hard shove and told him not to gawk,and Harry had needed to remind himself sharply that some people stilldidn’t know who the Boy-Who-Lived was—either that, or Madam Pomfrey’s identity was bound up with her absolute dominance of her ownhospital, etcetera, whatever.Behind the rows of beds were five doors, leading into the privaterooms where they stored the patients who would be staying for daysinstead of hours, but whose condition didn’t warrant a transfer to St.Mungos.Windowless, skyless, unlit but for a single smokeless torch on one ofthe solid stone walls; that was the room behind the middle door. Harryhad wondered whether professors could ask Hogwarts to change itself;
1016 *




or if the infirmary always had a room like that available, for people whodidn’t enjoy the light.In the center of the room, between two equal bedstands that looked tohave been carved from the same grey marble as the walls, rested a whitehospital bed, looking vaguely orangish in the unsmoking torchlight; andwithin that bed, a white sheet pulled up about his thighs and wearing ahospital gown, sat Professor Quirrell with his back slightly propped upagainst the headboard of the bed.There was something frightening about seeing Professor Quirrell inone of Madam Pomfrey’s beds, even if the Defense Professor appeared uninjured. Even knowing that Professor Quirrell had deliberately arrangedhis own apparent defeat at Severus’s hands, to give himself an excuse torecover his strength from Azkaban. Harry had never actually watched anyone dying in a hospital bed, but he’d seen too many movies. It was an intimation of mortality, and the Defense Professor was not supposed to bemortal.Madam Pomfrey had told Harry that he was absolutely forbidden topester her patient.Harry had said, “I understand,” which technically did not say anything about obedience.The stern old healer had then turned, and started to say to ProfessorQuirrell that he was absolutely not to overexert himself or… upset himself…Madam Pomfrey had trailed off, hurriedly turned around, and fledthe room.“Not bad,” Harry observed, after the door had shut behind the escaping medical matron. “I’ve got to learn how to do that, sometime.”Professor Quirrell smiled a smile with absolutely no humor content,and said, his voice sounding a good deal dryer than its usual dryness,“Thank you for your artistic critique, Mr. Potter.”Harry stared into the pale blue eyes, and thought that Professor Quirrell looked……older.It was subtle, it might have just been Harry’s imagination, it mighthave been the poor lighting. But the hair above Quirinus Quirrell’s fore*

head might have receded a bit, what remained might have thinned andgreyed, an advancing of the baldness that had already been visible on theback of his head. The face might have grown a little sunken.The pale blue eyes had stayed sharp and intense.“I am glad,” Harry said quietly, “to see you in what appears to be goodhealth.”“Appearances can be deceiving, of course,” said Professor Quirrell. Hegave a flick of his fingers, and when his hand finished the gesture he washolding his wand. “Would you believe that woman thinks she has confiscated this from me?”Six incantations the Defense Professor spoke then; six of the thirtythat he had used to safeguard their important conversations in Mary’sRoom.Harry raised his eyebrows, silently quizzical.“That is all I can manage for now,” said the Defense Professor. “I expect it shall prove sufficient. Still, there is a proverb: If you do not wish athing heard, do not say it. Consider it to apply in full measure. I am toldthat you were trying to see me?”“Yes,” Harry said. He paused, gathered his thoughts. “Did the Headmaster, or anyone, tell you that we can’t go to lunch any more?”“Something along those lines,” said the Defense Professor. And without changing expression, “Of course I was terribly sorry to hear it.”“It’s more extreme than that, actually,” said Harry. “I’m confined toHogwarts and its grounds indefinitely. I can’t leave without a guard and agood reason. I’m not going home for summer, and maybe not ever again.I was hoping… to speak with you, about that.”There was a pause.The Defense Professor exhaled a breath like a brief sigh, and said, “Weshall just have to rely on the known fact that the Deputy Headmistress willpersonally murder anyone who tries to report me. Mr. Potter, I intend tokeep this conversation on track so that we may conclude it quickly, is thatunderstood?”Harry nodded, and—In the light of the single torch, shaded toward the reddish end of theoptical spectrum, the snake’s green scales were not very reflective, and




the blue-and-white banding hardly more so. Dark seemed the snake, inthat light. The eyes, which had seemed like gray pits before, now reflectedthe torchlight, and seemed brighter than the rest of the snake.“Sso,” hissed the venomous creature. “What did you wissh to ssay?”And Harry hissed, “Sschoolmasster thinkss that woman'ss former Lord iss theone who sstole her from prisson.”Harry had thought about it this time, and carefully, before he had decided that he would reveal to Professor Quirrell only that the Headmaster believed that; and not say anything about the prophecy which had setVoldemort on Harry’s parents, nor that the Headmaster was reconstituting the Order of the Phoenix… it was a risk, a significant risk, but Harryneeded an ally in this.“He believess that one iss alive?” the snake finally said. The divided, twopronged tongue flickered rapidly from side to side, sardonic snakishlaughter. “Ssomehow I am not ssurprissed.”“Yess,” Harry hissed dryly, “very amussing, I am ssure. Except now am sstuckin Hogwartss for next ssix years, for ssafety! I have decided that I will, indeed, sseekpower; and conﬁnement iss not helpful for that. Musst convince sschoolmasster thatDark Lord iss not yet awakened, that esscape was work of ssome other power—”Again the rapid flickering of the snake’s tongue; the snakish laughterwas stronger, dryer, this time. “Amateur foolisshnesss.”“Pardon?” hissed Harry.“You ssee misstake, think of undoing, ssetting time back to sstart. Yet not evenwith hourglasss can time be undone. Musst move forward insstead. You think of convincing otherss they are misstaken. Far eassier to convince them they are right. Ssoconssider, boy: what new happensstance would make schoolmasster decide you weressafe once more, ssimultaneoussly advance your other agendass?”Harry stared at the snake, puzzled. His mind tried to comprehendand unravel the riddle—“Iss it not obviouss?” hissed the snake. Again the tongue flickered sardonic laughter. “To free yoursself, to gain power in Britain, you musst again besseen to defeat the Dark Lord.”





In reddish-orange flickering torchlight, a green snake swayed above awhite hospital bed, as the boy stared into the embers of its eyes.“Sso,” Harry said finally. “Let uss be clear on what iss propossed. You ssuggesstthat we sset up imposstor to imperssonate Dark Lord.”“Ssomething like that. Woman we resscued will cooperate, sshould be mosst convincing when sshe iss sseen at hiss sside.” More sardonic tongue-flickering. “Youare kidnapped from Hogwartss to public location, many witnesssess, wardss keep outprotectorss. Dark Lord announcess that he hass at long lasst regained physical form,after wandering as sspirit for yearss; ssayss that he hass gained sstill greater power,not even you can sstop him now. Offerss to let you duel. You casst guardian Charm,Dark Lord laughss at you, ssayss he iss not life-eater. Casstss Killing Cursse at you, youblock, watcherss ssee Dark Lord explode—”“Casst Killing Cursse?” Harry hissed in incredulity. “At me? Again? Ssecondtime? Nobody will believe Dark Lord could posssibly be that sstupid—”“You and I are only two people in country who would notice that,” hissed thesnake. “Trusst me on thiss, boy.”“What if there iss third, ssomeday?”The snake swayed thoughtfully. “Could write different sscript for play, if youwissh. Whatever sscenario, sshould leave open posssibility Dark Lord might return yetagain—nation musst think they are sstill dependent on you to protect them.”Harry stared into the red-flickering pits of the snake’s eyes.“Well?” hissed the swaying form.The obvious thought was that going along with the Defense Professor’s plots and deceptions a second time, spinning an even more complicated lie to cover up the first mistake, and creating another fatal vulnerability if anyone ever discovered the truth, would be exactly the same sortof stupidity as the putative Dark Lord using the Killing Curse again. Itdidn’t even take his Hufflepuff side to point that out, Harry thought it inhis very own mental voice.But there was also a certain question as to whether the appropriatemoral to learn from the last experience was to always say no immediatelyto the Defense Professor, or…“Will think about it,” hissed Harry. “Will not ansswer right away, thiss time,will enumerate risskss and beneﬁtss ﬁrsst—”




“Undersstood,” hissed the snake. “But remember thiss, boy, other eventss proceed without you. Hessitation iss alwayss eassy, rarely usseful.”
The boy emerged from the private room into the main infirmary, runningnervous fingers through his messy black hair as he walked past the whitebeds, occupied and unoccupied.Shortly afterward, the boy emerged from the Hogwarts infirmary entirely, passing Madam Pomfrey on the way out with a distracted nod.The boy walked out into a hallway, then into a larger corridor, andthen stopped and leaned against the wall.The thing was……he really didn’t want to be stuck in Hogwarts for the next six years;and when you thought about it…… the Incident with Rescuing Bellatrix From Azkaban wasn’t just imposing costs on Harry. Other people would be worrying, living in fear ofthe Dark Lord’s return, expending unknown resources to take unknownprecautions. Harry could demand that they write the script in such fashion as to make it seem not plausible that the Dark Lord would return athird time. And then people would relax, it would all be over.Unless of course there actually was a Dark Lord out there to be feared.There had been a prophecy.The boy leaning against the wall vented a soft sigh, and started walking again.Harry had almost forgotten, but he had gotten around to showingProfessor Quirrell the deck of cards he’d been given on Sunday night by‘Santa Claus’, within which the King of Hearts was allegedly a portkey thatwould take him to the Salem Witches’ Institute in America. Although ofcourse Harry hadn’t told Professor Quirrell who’d sent him the card, norwhat it was supposed to do, before he’d asked Professor Quirrell if it waspossible to tell where the portkey would send him.The Defense Professor had transformed back to human form, and examined the King of Hearts, tapping it a few times with his wand.
1021 *




And according to Professor Quirrell……the portkey would send the user somewhere in London, but hecouldn’t pinpoint it any nearer than that.Harry had shown Professor Quirrell the note that had accompaniedthe deck of cards, saying nothing of the earlier notes.Professor Quirrell had taken it in at a glance, given a dry chuckle, andobserved that if you read the note carefully, it did not explicitly say that theportkey would take him to the Salem Witches’ Institute.You needed to learn to pay attention to that kind of subtlety, ProfessorQuirrell said, if you wanted to be a powerful wizard when you grew up;or, indeed, if you wanted to grow up at all.The boy sighed again as he trudged off to class.He was starting to wonder if all the other wizarding schools were alsolike this, or if it was only Hogwarts that had a problem.



essitation iss alwayss eassy, rarely usseful.So the Defense Professor had told him; and while you could quibble about the details of the proverb, Harry understood the weaknesses ofRavenclaws well enough to know that you had to try answering your ownquibbles. Did some plans call for waiting? Yes, many plans called for delayed action; but that was not the same as hesitating to choose. Not delayingbecause you knew the right moment to do what was necessary, but delaying because you couldn’t make up your mind—there was no cunningplan which called for that.Did you sometimes need more information to choose? Yes, but thatcould also turn into an excuse for delaying; and it would be tempting to delay, when you were faced with a choice between two painful alternatives,and not choosing would avoid the mental pain for a time. So you wouldpick a piece of information you couldn’t easily obtain, and claim that youcouldn’t possibly decide without it; that would be your excuse. Althoughif you knew what information you needed, knew when and how you wouldobtain that information, and knew what you would do depending on eachpossible observation, then that was less suspicious as an excuse for hesitating.If you weren’t just hesitating, you ought to be able to choose in advancewhat you would do, once you had the extra information you claimed youneeded.






If the Dark Lord were really out there, would it be smart to go alongwith Professor Quirrell’s plan to have someone impersonate the DarkLord?No. Definitely no. Absolutely not.And if Harry knew for a fact that the Dark Lord wasn’t really out there…in that case…The Defense Professor’s office was a small room, at least today; ithad changed since the last time Harry had seen it, the stone of the roombecoming darker, more polished. Behind the Defense Professor’s deskstood the single empty bookcase that always decorated the room, a tallbookcase stretching almost from the floor to the ceiling, with sevenempty wooden shelves. Harry had only once seen Professor Quirrell takea book from those empty shelves, and never seen him put a book back.The green snake swayed above the seat of the chair behind the Defense Professor’s desk, the lidless eyes staring unblinking at Harry fromclose to his own eye level.They were warded now by twenty-two spells, all that could be castwithin Hogwarts without attracting the Headmaster’s attention.“No,” hissed Harry.The green snake cocked its head, tilting it slightly; no emotion wasconveyed by the gesture, not that Harry’s Parselmouth talent conveyedto him. “Reasson not?” said the green snake.“Too rissky,” Harry said simply. That was true whether or not the DarkLord was out there. Forcing himself to decide in advance had made himrealize that he’d just been using the unanswered question as an excuse tohesitate; the sane decision was the same, either way.For a moment the dark pitted eyes seemed to gleam blackly, for a moment the scaled mouth gaped to expose the fangs. “Think you have learnedwrong lessson, boy, from previouss failure. My planss are not in habit of failing, andlasst one would have gone flawlesssly, but for your own foolisshnesss. Correct lesssoniss to follow ssteps laid down for you by older and wisser Sslytherin, tame your wildimpulssess.”“Lessson I learned is not to try plotss that would make girl-child friend think I amevil or boy-child friend think I am sstupid,” Harry snapped back. He’d been plan* 1024 *




ning a more temporizing response than that, but somehow the words hadjust slipped out.The sssss-ing sound that came from the snake was not heard by Harryas words, only as pure fury. A moment later, “You told them—”“Of coursse not! But know what they would ssay.”There was a long pause as the snake-head swayed, staring at Harry;again no detectable emotion came through, and Harry wondered whatProfessor Quirrell could be thinking that would take Professor Quirrellthat long to think.“You sserioussly care what thosse two think?” came the snake’s final hiss.“True younglingss thosse two are, not like you. Could not weigh adult matterss.”“Might have done better than me,” Harry hissed. “Boy-child friend would haveassked after ssecret motivess before asssenting to resscue woman—”“Glad you undersstand that now,” the snake hissed coldly. “Alwayss assk after other'ss advantage. Next learn to alwayss assk after your own. If my plan iss notto your tasste, what iss yours?”“If necesssary—sstay at sschool ssix yearss and sstudy. Hogwartss sseemss ﬁneplace to dwell. Bookss, friendss, sstrange but tassty food.” Harry wanted tochuckle, but there wasn’t any gesture in Parseltongue for the kind oflaughter he wanted to express.The pits of the snake’s eyes seemed almost black. “Eassy to ssay that now.Ssuch as you and I, we do not tolerate imprissonment. You will losse patience long before sseventh year, perhapss before end of thiss one. I sshall plan accordingly.”And before Harry could hiss another word of Parseltongue, thehuman-shape of Professor Quirrell was sitting in his chair once more.“So, Mr. Potter,” said the Defense Professor, his voice as calm as if theyhad been discussing nothing important, as if the whole conversation hadnot occurred at all, “I hear that you have begun to practice dueling. Notthe worthless sort with rules, I hope?”
Hannah Abbott looked as unnerved as Hermione had ever seen her (except on the day of the phoenix, the day Bellatrix Black had escaped, which




shouldn’t ought to count for anyone). The Hufflepuff girl had come overto the Ravenclaw table during dinner, and tapped Hermione on her shoulder, and very nearly dragged her away—“Neville and Harry Potter are learning dueling from Mr. Diggory!”Hannah blurted as soon as they were a few steps away from the table.“Who?” said Hermione.“Cedric Diggory!” said Hannah. “He’s the Captain of our QuidditchTeam, and general of an army, and he’s taking all the electives and getting better grades than anyone, and I hear he learns dueling from professional tutors during the summers, and he once beat two seventh-yearstudents, and even some teachers call him the Super Hufflepuff, and Professor Sprout says we should all emu, uh, emudate him or something likethat, and—”After Hannah finally stopped for air (the list had gone on for a while),Hermione managed to insert a word in edgewise.“Sunshine Soldier Abbott!” said Hermione. “Calm down. We’re notgoing to be fighting General Diggory, right? Sure, Neville’s studying tobeat us, but we can study too—”“Don’t you see?” Hannah shrieked, raising her voice a lot louder than itshould’ve been, if they were trying to keep the conversation private fromall the Ravenclaws looking at them. “Neville isn’t studying to beat us! He’spracticing so he can fight Bellatrix Black! They’re going to go through uslike a Bludger through a stack of pancakes!”The Sunshine General gave her soldier a look. “Listen,” said Hermione, “I don’t think a few weeks of practice is going to make anyone aninvincible fighter. Plus we already know how to handle invincible fighters. We’ll concentrate fire on them and they’ll go down just like Draco.”The Hufflepuff girl was looking at her with mixed admiration andskepticism. “Aren’t you even, you know, worried?”“Oh, honestly!” said Hermione. Sometimes it was hard being the onlysensible person in your whole school year. “Haven’t you ever heard thesaying, the only thing we have to fear is fear itself?”“What?” said Hannah. “That’s crazy, what about Lethifolds lurkingin the darkness, and being put under the Imperius Curse, and horribleTransfiguration accidents and—”




“I mean,” said Hermione, exasperation leaking out into her nowraised voice, she’d been hearing this sort of thing all week now, “howabout if we wait until after the Chaos Legion actually crushes us to get soscared of them and did you just mutter ‘Gryffindors’ under your voice?”A few moments later, Hermione was walking back to her place at thetable with a sweet smile plastered onto her young face, it wasn’t the terrible cold glare of Harry’s dark side but it was the scariest face she knewhow to make.Harry Potter was going down.
“This is loony,” gasped Neville, with what tiny amount of breath he couldspare from being completely out of breath.“This is brilliant!” said Cedric Diggory. The eyes of the Super Hufflepuff gleamed with manic enthusiasm, shining like the sweat on hisforehead as he stamped his feet through the dance of one of his duelingpostures. His usually-light steps had changed to heavier stomps, whichmight have had something to do with the Transfigured metal weightsthey’d all attached to their arms and legs and strapped over their chests.“Where do you get these ideas, Mr. Potter?”“A strange old shop… in Oxford… and I’m never… shopping there…again.” Thud.



n the high reaches of Hogwarts where rooms and corridors changed ona daily basis, where the territory itself was uncertain and not just themap, where the stability of the castle began to fray into dreams and chaoswithout changing its architectural style or apparent solidity—in the highreaches of Hogwarts, a battle would soon be fought.The presence of so many students would stabilize the corridors for atime, by dint of constant observation. The rooms and corridors of Hogwarts sometimes moved even while people looked directly at them, butthey wouldn’t change. Even after eight centuries, Hogwarts was still a little shy about changing in front of people.But despite that transient permanence (the Defense Professor hadsaid) the upper reaches of Hogwarts still had a military realism: you hadto learn the ground anew each time, and check every closet for secret corridors all over again.Sunday it was, Sunday the first of March. Professor Quirrell had recovered enough to supervise battles once more, and they were all catchingup on the backlog.The Dragon General, Draco Malfoy, watched two compasses he heldin either hand. One compass was the color of the Sun, the other had amulticolored, iridescent sheen to indicate Chaos. The other two generals, Draco knew, had been given their own compasses; only HermioneGranger’s hand, and Harry Potter’s hand, would hold a compass that wasorange-red and flickered in its reflections like fire, pointing always to thedirection of the largest active contingent of Dragon Army.






Without those compasses they might have searched for days andnever found each other, which was a territorial hazard of fighting in theupper levels of Hogwarts.Draco had a bad feeling about what would happen when DragonArmy found the Chaos Legion. Harry Potter had changed since BellatrixBlack had escaped; the Heir of Slytherin had begun to seem truly Lordlynow (and how had Professor Quirrell known that would happen?) Dracowould have felt a lot better with Hermione Granger standing alongside him with her twenty-three Sunshine Soldiers in tow, but no, theSunshine General was being stupidly proud and refusing to accept aidagainst General Potter. She wanted to take down Potter herself, she’dtold him.The Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy had maintained theirinfluence over Britain for centuries by understanding that you couldn’talways be the most powerful. Sometimes another Lord was just stronger,and you had to settle for merely being his foremost lieutenant. You couldbuild up quite a position of wealth and power over a dozen generations ofbeing second in command. You just had to be careful, each time, not tolet your House be dragged down with the fall of the Lord you served. Thatwas the Malfoy tradition which centuries of experience had honed…And so Father had thoroughly explained to Draco that if he ran intosomeone who was obviously stronger than him, Draco was not to resentthis and not to deny it and not to throw a tantrum that could sabotage hispotential position, but Draco was to make sure that his place in the nextgeneration’s power structure wasn’t any lower than second.Granger, apparently, had never gotten this lecture from her own parents, and was still in denial about the obvious fact that Harry Potter wasbecoming stronger than her.So Draco had secretly met with Captain Goldstein and Captain Bonesand Captain Macmillan and they’d agreed to all do their best to make surethat Dragon and Sunshine didn’t engage each other before they engagedthe larger threat of Chaos.It wasn’t really violating the agreement against traitors, you weren’tsoliciting traitors if you honestly meant to help the other army.A high ringing tone belled through the corridors to signal the start




of the battle, and a moment later Draco shouted “Go!” and the Dragonsstarted running. It would tire his soldiers, it would cost them somethingeven after they stopped and caught their breath, but they had to put Chaosdirectly between themselves and the Sunshine Regiment.
Harry and Neville walked at a leisurely pace through the corridors, Harrywatching the yellow-golden compass that pointed toward the location ofthe Sunshine Regiment, and Neville keeping a lookout just in case theyran into someone else.Their footsteps sounded a bit thumpy, if you listened closely.“So,” the Chaotic Lieutenant said after a while. “That’s why you hadus practice dueling with all that weight strapped on?”Harry nodded, keeping his eyes on the compass that led to Sunshine;if the apparent direction started to change quickly then they were gettingclose.“I didn’t want to say anything in front of the others, but a couple ofweeks isn’t a lot of time to put on extra muscle,” said Neville. “And thebalance is different, and I think this weighs more actually, and doesn’tthis count as Transfiguring a Muggle artifact?”“Nope,” Harry said. “I checked that in advance. You can see it in Hogwarts statues, so some wizards used to wear it, even if they were just beingfashionable for the Dark Ages.” And since nobody would ever try this ifthey weren’t fighting first-year students using weak spells like the SleepHex, it didn’t count as giving away good ideas, either.They came to a Y-intersection, an annoying one; neither corridor bentin quite the right way to take them on a direct intercept course towardwhere Sunshine would go as they followed the Chaos Legion followingDragon Army. So Harry chose what seemed like the better of the two options, and Neville followed.“We’d better try a quick Silencing Charm on this stuff when we getclose,” Neville said. “It’s kind of noisy, they might figure it out.”




Harry nodded, and then said “Good idea” in case Neville hadn’t beenlooking at him.They trudged on through the stone-floored corridor of the upperreach of Hogwarts, lit by windows of plain glass or stained glass, nowand then passing statues of witches and dragons and even the occasionalwizard-knight in plate armor or chainmail.
The Sunshine Soldiers were striding through a long, wide corridor withtheir wands out and pointed. They couldn’t use the Prismatic Shieldwhile they were maneuvering, but Parvati Patil and Jenny Rustad werecurrently maintaining Contegos around the officer group, who would bethe first targets of any ambush.Their tactic for the next battle, she and her officers had decided,would be to mix directly in with the enemy soldiers as fast as possible—after having practiced among themselves how to support one another,avoid hitting each other, and get into positions where enemy soldierswould hesitate to fire. They’d only gotten in four hours practice, butshe thought her troops would already be better at that kind of mixed-infighting than soldiers who hadn’t practiced at all. It seemed like the sortof tactic Chaos would use, but they hadn’t actually used it yet.It was a good strategy, she believed. And yet still, no matter how muchshe’d lectured her soldiers, they’d persisted in whispering fearful rumorsabout what Harry and Neville were learning to do. Finally she’d goneoff and talked with Captain Goldstein, who understood things like TroopMorale, and Anthony had suggested—“That’s weird,” Captain Macmillan spoke up suddenly, frowning atthe fiery and iridescent compasses he held in either hand. (Ernie was,as Harry would have termed it, “good at spatial visualization”, and so hadbeen designated to hold both compasses and try to figure out what theirenemies were doing.) “I think… Dragon’s not moving fast anymore… Ithink they got on the other side of Chaos from us first… and it looks like




Chaos is moving to attack them instead of trying to maneuver out fromin between?”Hermione frowned, trying to understand, and she saw similar frownson the faces of Anthony and Ron. If Chaos and Dragon attacked eachother straight out, and spent all their forces fighting each other, that waspractically conceding the battle to Sunshine…“Potter thinks we’re allied so he’s attacking Malfoy now, beforeDragon can link up with us,” said Blaise Zabini from the common ranksof soldiers. “Or Potter just thinks he can beat both armies in a row, if heattacks them separately.” The Slytherin boy gave a condescending sigh.“Are you going to promote me back to officer now? You lot are hopelesswithout me, you know.”They all ignored the talking noises coming from Zabini’s mouth.“We still moving in the right direction?” said Anthony.“Yeah,” said Ernie.“We getting close to them?” said Ron.“Not yet—”That was when the huge black-wooden doors at the end of the corridor flew open and crashed into the wall, revealing two figures almostcompletely enveloped in grey cloaks, grey cloth stretched over the facesbeneath the grey hoods, one of those figures already raising a wand andpointing it directly at her.And then the face of the game changed drastically, as Harry’s voice,high and strained with the effort, screamed the word:“Stupefy!”The dueling-grade stunner blasted toward her, she was so shockedthat she didn’t start to move until almost too late, as the red jet of lightsmashed right through the Contego shield to their front and she just barelydodged, there was a tingle on her arm as the red light went past her, andshe saw out of the corner of her eye Susan getting hit and blown off herfeet into Ron—“Somnium!” bellowed Anthony’s voice, followed a moment later by adozen voices crying “Somnium!”Hermione frantically pushed herself to her feet, and as she rose, shesaw the two figures in the grey cloaks just standing there.




You couldn’t see Sleep Hexes, the spell was too weak—But there was no way they all could’ve missed.“Stupefy!” shrieked the voice of Neville Longbottom, and another redjet shot at her, she fell in an undignified heap as she desperately twistedout of the way, and when she scrambled up, panting, she saw that thistime the stunbolt had gotten Ron where he’d been rising from the ground.“Hello there, Sunshine,” said Harry’s voice from beneath his hood.“We’re the Grey Knights of Chaos,” said Neville’s voice.“We’ll be your opponents for this battle,” said Harry’s voice, “whileChaos’s other army slaughters the Dragons.”“And by the way,” said Neville’s voice, “we’re invincible.”
The two boys in their grey cloaks and robes, grey cloth over their faces,stood facing Sunshine’s entire army, seemingly unfazed by a dozen SleepHexes.Daphne heard a soft sigh from beside her, and when her head turnedshe saw that Hannah’s lips were parted, and the Hufflepuff girl’s eyeswere huge, and she was staring at—It would have been hard to describe the jumble of thoughts thatflashed through Daphne’s mind as she realized that Hannah was staring at Neville rather than Harry, which in turn seemed to trigger somepart of her into noticing that in point of fact Neville had been gettingpretty interesting lately as boys went, in fact right now the Last Scion ofLongbottom was seeming downright cool, and something woke up insideher and her own lips parted and everything the Lady her Mother hadever instructed her about demure demeanors and flattery and scentedshampoo blew straight out of her mind so hard it should have fluffed herhair about her ears, because she’d watched Hermione and Harry and sheknew how she wanted her own courtship to go—Her Lady Mother had also recently instructed her on a few spells itmight be embarrassing not to know if you belonged to the Noble andMost Ancient House of Greengrass.




Daphne’s wand swung to point to her left, and she shouted “Tonare!”The wand went over her head, and she spoke the incantation “RavumCalvaria!”And finally she grasped her wand in both hands and shrieked, “LucisGladius!”The huge magical drain almost sent her to her knees, but she bore it,and when the blazing shape had fully formed and stabilized the drain wasa little less.Still, she had a feeling she’d better not try to fight with this for long.That everyone was staring at her went quite without saying, and sheshould have leaped forward to confront Neville with her hair billowingaround her, but it was all she could do to walk forward steadily to level herMost Ancient Blade at Neville Longbottom. That everyone moved asideand made way for her also went without saying.“I hight Daphne, of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Greengrass!” shecried. “Greengrass of Sunshine!” The dueling forms had gone completelyout of her mind, she’d seen enough plays to remember death challengesand blood challenges but she couldn’t remember at all what was appropriate for this, so she just pointed the incandescent sword toward the objectof her crush and yelled, “Let’s see what you got, Nevvy!”Once again Harry’s voice shrieked “Stupefy!”, and later on, when shewas remembering this, she could never quite believe she’d managed to doit, but she slashed out with her blade of light like it was a Beater’s bat, andhit the stunbolt back at Harry who just barely managed to twist out of theway.“Tonare!” shouted Neville, of the Noble and Most Ancient House ofLongbottom. “Ravum Calvaria, Lucis Gladius!”
For a few seconds, no one did anything but stare at Neville and Daphne asthey started whacking at each other. They were both moving slowly, andHermione guessed that the spell was taking a lot of strength out of them.




It wasn’t very impressive by comparison, if you were a Muggleborn andyou’d watched certain movies.But you still had to give them extra credit for using lightsabers at all.“Point of order,” said Harry’s voice. “I know the Defense Professor iswatching, but I still have to ask, does anyone know whether they’ll sliceeach other in half if they actually hit—”“No,” Hermione said absently. This had been in one of her historybooks, though she’d had no idea the magical dueling sword looked likethat. “They cast it so it’ll only stun if it touches.”“You know that spell?”“Oh, no, it’s the Charm of the Most Ancient Blade, it’s only legal forNoble and Most Ancient Houses to use—”Hermione stopped talking and looked at Harry, or Harry’s grey hoodrather.“Well,” said Harry’s voice, “I guess I could take down the rest of theSunshine Regiment by myself, then.” She couldn’t see his face, but hisvoice sounded like he was smiling.“You dodged when Daphne hit your own spell back at you,” Hermionesaid. “So whatever you did, you’re not invincible. A Stupefy can still getyou.”“Interesting theory,” said Harry’s voice from beneath the hood. “Gotanyone in your army who can test it?”“I read about the Stunning Hex once,” said Hermione. “A few monthsago. I wonder if I can remember the instructions right?” Her wand cameup to point at Harry.There was a slight pause, as nearby a boy and a girl breathing in audible gasps slowly whacked at each other with lightsabers.“Of course,” Harry said, leveling his own wand on her, “I can just useSomnium on you. That’ll take a lot less effort.”New Contego shields sprung into existence in front of her, cast byJenny and Parvati, even as Harry spoke.The tip of Hermione’s own wand began making small motions in theair, a diamond within a circle, a diamond within a circle, rehearsing thegesture to match exactly what she remembered seeing in the book. Itwould be a difficult feat even for her, but she had to cast the spell right




on the first try, she couldn’t afford any failed castings that would sap herenergy.“You know,” said Hermione Granger, “I understand that it’s not reallyyour fault, but I’m getting tired of hearing people talk about the Boy-WhoLived like you’re—like you’re some kind of god or something.”“Same here, I must say,” said Harry Potter. “It’s sad how people keepunderestimating me.”Her wand kept rehearsing the diamond within the circle, over andover. Harry would be recharging his own strength, she knew, even as shepracticed as much as she could before her attack. “I’m starting to thinkyou need taking down a peg, General Chaos.”“You could be right,” Harry said equably. His feet began to shufflethrough what she recognized as a duelist’s dance. “Unfortunately there’snothing left that can defeat me now except another Harry Potter.”“Let me be specific, Mr. Potter. I’m taking you down a peg.”“You and what other army?”“You think you’re pretty cool, don’t you,” said Hermione.“Why, yes,” said Harry. “Yes, I do. Some might call that arrogant, butam I supposed to be the last person in Hogwarts to notice how awesomeI am?”Hermione raised her left hand into the air, and made a fist.It was a signal. Eight designated soldiers in her army would be pointing their wands at her, and quietly casting Wingardium Leviosa.They’d practiced this, too, once Hermione had given up on lecturingher soldiers, and at Anthony’s suggestion, tried giving them a SunshineGeneral who looked like she could defeat invincible enemies.“You pretend you’re Superman,” said Hermione. She raised her leftfist higher in the air, and the eight soldiers supporting her Hovered heroff the ground. “Well here’s Super Hermione!” Her hand pushed forward,and as she shot rapidly through the air toward Harry, regretting only thatshe couldn’t see the look on his face, her wand made a diamond withina circle and she summoned up all the magic she could, it felt like sheimagined touching a live wire would feel as the too-powerful spell pouredthrough her when her voice screamed “Stupefy!”The red bolt burst from her wand, perfectly formed.




Harry dodged it.And then, because they hadn’t practiced doing this part inside of hallways, she crashed into a wall.
“Somnium!” shrieked Draco, and then after only a few seconds to recharge,He knew he was hitting Theodore, the other boy wasn’t even trying tododge, but the scion of Nott only grinned as evilly as his father and leveledhis wand—Draco managed to leap aside just as Theodore said “Somnium!” butDraco was getting winded, he couldn’t keep this up, Theodore wasn’tbothering to dodge at all while Draco had to keep moving, this was crazy.He had enough strength now to fire again, but—Stupidity is doing the same thing and expecting a different result, Harry hadsaid, this was Harry’s work somehow, it couldn’t be a Muggle artifact anymore but Draco couldn’t figure out what it could be, and he should bethinking of hypotheses and ways to test them but he was too busy frantically dodging as Theodore laughed and shot another Sleep Hex at him,Draco felt a little numbness in his side that time as he twisted, that hadbeen a very very near miss and finally Draco couldn’t take it anymore, hedidn’t bother working out what theory he was testing or why as he just—“Luminos!” shouted Draco, and Theodore was haloed in red light, “Dulak!” and it went out again (so Theodore was still being affected by magic),“Expelliarmus!” and Theodore’s wand went flying (that had been a goodspell to cast anyway now that Draco realized it) but Theodore was rushing toward Draco with his arms outstretched to grapple so Draco yelled“Flipendo!” and the other boy’s feet were abruptly yanked up——and Theodore’s back hit the ground with a surprisingly loud andmetallic-sounding crash.Draco’s vision was swimming now from casting four spells in suchfast succession, and Theodore was already scrambling to his feet, so there




wasn’t even time to think in words, but Draco still managed to say “Somnium!” and this time he aimed for Theodore’s face instead of the chest.Theodore dodged (he dodged!) and the boy shouted “Code seven on Malfoy!”“Prismatis!” cried Padma’s voice and there was suddenly a shimmering rainbow wall in front of Draco, just as four Chaotic voices cried “Somnium!”And there was a pause, as everyone looked at the huge PrismaticSphere protecting the remnants of Dragon Army.Casting that fifth spell had sent Draco to his hands and knees, buthe looked up and managed to say, as clearly as he could, “If the SleepHex—doesn’t work—aim for the face—I think the Lieutenants are wearing metal shirts.”“You’ve already lost too many soldiers,” Finnigan said loudly fromacross the barrier, “we’ll beat you anyway,” and then the Gryffindor boylaughed evilly. He did the evil laughter almost as well as Harry Potter bynow, and the other Chaotic Legionnaires started laughing with him soonafterward.Draco could see from the corner of his eye where Gregory and Vincentlay unconscious. Padma was still sustaining the Prismatic Sphere, thelargest one he’d ever seen her cast; but she was breathing hard, still visiblysweaty from when they’d all jogged to get into position, the Ravenclawgirl was a strong witch but not an athletic one.He really hoped General Granger got here soon and hit Chaos frombehind. General Potter and Neville of Chaos were missing, and Dracocould guess where they’d gone, but two soldiers couldn’t delay the wholeSunshine Regiment for too long all by themselves, could they?
She knew it wasn’t fair, that the other girl had given all she could, butHermione still wished that Daphne had lasted longer.“Lagann!” said Neville’s voice from behind her as she flew, and therewas the sound of a Prismatic Wall shattering, Hannah’s voice desperately




cried “Somnium!” and then a few moments later Neville’s voice calmly said“Somnium” and there was the thud of another of her soldiers falling over.And the force keeping her in the air diminished again, Hermionecould feel the grab of the Hover Charms straining at her, but now it justwasn’t enough.Her flight stopped and she began falling in slow motion toward theground, and she should’ve signaled her soldiers to just drop her, but shewas too angry and confused and not thinking fast enough and still trying to muster the strength for one last Stunning Hex, and so there wasnowhere to go when Harry pointed his wand at her and said “Somnium”and that was the last word that Hermione Granger heard of her battle.



ermione wasn’t feeling very nice right now, or Good either, there wasa hot ball of anger burning inside her and she wondered if this wassomething like Harry’s darkness (though it probably wasn’t even close)and she shouldn’t have felt that way over some silly little game but—Her whole army. Two soldiers had beaten her whole army. That waswhat she’d been told after she woke up.It was a little too much.“Well,” Professor Quirrell said. From up close the Defense Professordidn’t look quite as healthy as he had the last time she’d been in his office;his skin looked paler, and he moved a little slower. His expression was asstern as ever, and his gaze as penetrating; his fingers tapped sharply onhis desk, rap-rap. “I would guess that of the three of you, only Mr. Malfoyhas guessed why I’ve asked you here.”“Something to do with Noble and Most Ancient Houses?” said Harryfrom beside her, sounding puzzled. “I didn’t violate some kind of crazylaw by firing on Daphne, did I?”“Not quite,” the man said with heavy irony. “Since Miss Greengrassdid not invoke the correct dueling forms, she is not entitled to demandthat you be stripped of your House name. Although of course I wouldnot have permitted a formal duel. Wars do not respect such rules.” TheDefense Professor leaned forward and rested his chin on steepled hands,as though sitting upright had already tired him. His eyes gazed at them,sharp and dangerous. “General Malfoy. Why did I call you here?”






“General Potter against the two of us isn’t a fair fight anymore,” DracoMalfoy said in a quiet voice.“What?” blurted Hermione. “We almost had them, if Daphne hadn’tfainted—”“Miss Greengrass did not faint from magical exhaustion,” ProfessorQuirrell said dryly. “Mr. Potter shot her in the back with a Sleep Hex whileyour soldiers were distracted by the sight of their general flying into awall. But congratulations nonetheless, Miss Granger, on almost defeatingtwo Chaotic Legionnaires with a mere twenty-four Sunshine Soldiers.”The blood flaming in her cheeks grew a little hotter. “That—that wasjust—if I’d only figured out he was wearing armor—”Professor Quirrell gazed at her from over touched fingers. “Of coursethere are ways you could have won, Miss Granger. There always are, inevery lost battle. The world around us redunds with opportunities, explodes with opportunities, which nearly all folk ignore because it wouldrequire them to violate a habit of thought; in every battle a thousand Hufflepuff bones waiting to be sharpened into spears. If you had thought totry a massed Finite Incantatem on general principles, you would have dispelled Mr. Potter’s suit of chainmail and everything else he was wearingexcept his underwear, which leads me to suspect that Mr. Potter did notquite realize his own vulnerability. Or you could have had your soldiersswarm Mr. Potter and Mr. Longbottom and physically wrest the wandsfrom their hands. Mr. Malfoy’s own response was not what I would termwell-reasoned, but at least he did not wholly ignore his thousand alternatives.” A sardonic smile. “But you, Miss Granger, had the misfortune toremember how to cast the Stunning Hex, and so you did not search yourexcellent memory for a dozen easier spells that might have proved efficacious. And you pinned all your army’s hopes on your own person, sothey lost spirit when you fell. Afterward they continued to cast their futileSleep Hexes, governed by the habits of fighting that had been trained intothem, unable to break the pattern as Mr. Malfoy did. I cannot quite comprehend what goes through people’s minds when they repeat the samefailed strategy over and over, but apparently it is an astonishingly rare realization that you can try something else. And so the Sunshine Regimentwas wiped out by two soldiers.” The Defense Professor grinned mirth* 1042 *




lessly. “One perceives certain similarities to how fifty Death Eaters dominated all of magical Britain, and how our much-loved Ministry continuesin its rule.”The Defense Professor sighed. “Nonetheless, Miss Granger, the fact remains that this is not the first such defeat for you. In the previous battle,you and Mr. Malfoy united your forces, and yet you were fought to a standstill, so that you and Mr. Malfoy had to pursue Mr. Potter onto the roof.The Chaos Legion has now demonstrated, twice in succession, militarystrength equal to both other armies combined. This leaves me no choice.General Potter, you will select eight soldiers from your army, includingat least one Chaotic Lieutenant, to be divided among Dragon Army andthe Sunshine Regiment—”“What?” Hermione burst out again, she glanced over at the other generals and saw that Harry looked as shocked as her, while Draco Malfoyonly looked resigned.“General Potter is stronger than both of you together,” Professor Quirrell said with calm precision. “Your contest is over, he has won, and it istime to rebalance the three armies to present him with a renewed challenge.”“Professor Quirrell!” said Harry. “I didn’t—”“This is my decision as the Professor of Battle Magic at the HogwartsSchool of Witchcraft and Wizardry and it is not subject to negotiation.”The words were still precise, but the look in Professor Quirrell’s eyeschilled Hermione’s blood, even though he was glaring at Harry and notat her. “And I find it suspicious, Mr. Potter, that the moment you wishedto isolate Miss Granger and Mr. Malfoy and force them to chase youonto the roof, you were able to annihilate just exactly as much of theirunited force as you pleased. Indeed, that is the level of performance Iexpected of you since the start of this year, and I am annoyed to discoverthat you have been holding back in my classes this entire time! I haveseen what you can truly do, Mr. Potter. You are far beyond the pointwhere Mr. Malfoy or Miss Granger can fight you on an equal level, andyou will not be permitted to pretend otherwise. This, Mr. Potter, I tell youin my capacity as your professor: For you to learn to your full potential,you must exercise your full abilities and not hold back for any reason—




particularly not childish frets over what your friends might think!”
She left the Defense Professor’s office with a larger army, and less dignity, and feeling a lot like a sad little bug that had just been squished, andtrying very very hard not to cry.“I wasn’t holding back!” Harry said as soon as they turned the first corner away from Professor Quirrell’s office, the moment the wooden doorfaded out of sight behind the stone walls. “I wasn’t pretending, I never leteither of you win!”She didn’t answer, couldn’t answer, it would all break loose if she triedto say a word.“Really?” said Draco Malfoy. The Dragon General still had that air ofresignation. “Because Quirrell’s right, you know, it’s suspicious that youcould beat nearly everyone in both our armies as soon as you wanted tomake us chase you onto the roof. And didn’t you say something then, Potter, about us needing to beat you when you were fighting for real?”The burning sensation was creeping up her throat, and when itreached her eyes she would burst into tears, and from then on she wouldbe just a crying little girl to both of them.“That—” Harry’s voice said urgently, she wasn’t looking at him but hisvoice sounded like he had his head turned toward her. “That was—I trieda lot harder that time, there was an important reason, I had to, so I useda whole bunch of tricks I’d been saving up—and—”She’d always been trying her hardest, every time.“—and I, I let out a side of myself I wouldn’t usually use for somethinglike Defense class—”So if she ever got close to winning against Harry when it really mattered, he could just go into his dark side and crush her, was that it?…of course it was. She couldn’t even look Harry in the eyes when hewas being scary, how had she ever thought she could beat him for real?




The corridor forked, and Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy went left toward a staircase that climbed to the second floor, and she went right instead, she didn’t even know where that passage went but right now she’drather be lost in the castle.“Excuse me, Draco,” said Harry’s voice, and then there was a patteringof footsteps behind her.“Leave me alone,” she said, it came out sounding stern but then shehad to shut her mouth and press her lips together tightly and hold herbreath to stop it all from coming out.That boy just kept on coming, and ran around her and put himselfin front of her, because he was stupid that was why, and Harry said, hisvoice now a high and desperate whisper, “I didn’t run away when you werebeating me in all my classes except broomstick riding!”He didn’t understand, and he would never understand, Harry Potter would never understand, because no matter what contest he lost hewould still be the Boy-Who-Lived, if you were Harry Potter and Hermione Granger was beating you then it meant everyone was expecting youto rise to the challenge, if you were Hermione Granger and Harry Potterwas beating you that meant you were just no one.“It’s not fair,” she said, her voice was shaking but she wasn’t crying yet,not yet, “I shouldn’t have to fight your dark side, I’m just—I’m only—” I’monly twelve, that was what she thought then.“I only used my dark side once and that was—when I had to!”“So today you beat my whole army being just Harry?” She still wasn’tcrying yet, and she wondered what her face looked like right now, if shelooked like an angry Hermione or a sad one.“I—” Harry said. His voice got a little lower, “I wasn’t… really expectingto win, that time, I know I said I was invincible but that was just to try toscare you, I really just thought we’d slow you down for a bit—”She started walking again, walked right past him, and as she passedHarry’s face tightened up like he was going to cry.“Is Professor Quirrell right?” came a high desperate whisper from behind her. “If I have you for a friend, will I always be afraid to do betterbecause I know it will hurt your feelings? That’s not fair, Hermione!”




She took a breath and held it and ran, her feet pattering across thestone as fast as they could, running as fast as she dared with her visionall blurry, ran so that no one would hear her, and this time Harry didn’tfollow.
Minerva was going over the Transfiguration parchment due Monday,and had just marked down to negative two hundred points a fifth-yearparchment with an error that could have potentially killed someone. During her first year as a professor she’d been indignant at the folly of olderstudents, now she was just resigned. Some people not only never learned,they never noticed that they were hopeless, they stayed bright and eagerand kept on trying. Sometimes they believed you when you told them,before they left Hogwarts, that they must never try anything unusual,give up free Transfiguration and use the art only through establishedCharms; and sometimes… they didn’t.She was in the middle of trying to unravel a particularly convolutedanswer when a knock at the door disrupted her thoughts; and it wasn’ther office hours, but it had only taken a very short time as Head of Gryffindor House for her to learn to suspend judgment. You could alwaysdeduct House points afterward.“Come in,” she said in a crisp voice.The young girl who entered her office had clearly been crying, andthen afterward had washed her face in hopes it wouldn’t show—“Miss Granger!” said Professor McGonagall. It had taken her a moment to recognize that face with its eyes reddened and cheeks puffed.“What happened?”“Professor,” said the young girl in a wavering voice, “you said that if Iwas ever worried or uncomfortable about anything, I should come to youat once—”“Yes,” said Professor McGonagall, “now what happened?”The girl started to explain—





Hermione stood still and the stairs turned around her, a revolving helixthat shouldn’t have taken her anywhere at all, and instead bore her continuously upward. Hermione thought it seemed like the Enchantment ofthe Endless Stair, which had been invented in 1733 by the wizard ArramSabeti who’d lived on top of Mount Everest in the days when no Mugglescould climb it. Only that couldn’t be right because Hogwarts was mucholder—maybe the enchantment had been reinvented?She should’ve been frightened, should’ve been nervous about her second meeting with the Headmaster.She was, in fact, frightened and nervous about her second meetingwith the Headmaster.Only Hermione Granger had been thinking; she’d been thinking a lot,after she hadn’t been able to run any further and had slid down againstthe wall with her lungs on fire, thinking while she curled up in a ball withher back against the chilly stone wall and her legs drawn up and crying.Even if she lost to Harry Potter she was never, ever going to lose toDraco Malfoy, that was just totally absolutely unacceptable, and ProfessorQuirrell had praised General Malfoy for not ignoring his thousand alternatives; and so after Hermione had cried herself out she’d thought of fourteen other spells she should’ve tried against Harry and Neville, and thenshe’d started wondering if she might be making the same sort of mistakeabout other things; and that was how she’d ended up knocking on Professor McGonagall’s door. Not asking for help, right now Hermione didn’thave any plans she could ask for help with, just telling Professor McGonagall everything, because when she’d thought of it that had seemed likeone of the thousand alternatives that Professor Quirrell had been talkingabout.And she’d told Professor McGonagall about how Harry Potter hadchanged since the day the phoenix had been on his shoulder, and abouthow people more and more seemed to see her as just something ofHarry’s, and how it seemed like Harry was pulling farther and fartheraway from everyone else in their school year and went around with a sadair sometimes like he was losing something, and she didn’t know what to




do anymore.And Professor McGonagall had told her that they needed to talk to theHeadmaster.And Hermione had felt worried, but then the thought had come toher that Harry Potter wouldn’t have been scared of the Headmaster. HarryPotter would have just barged ahead doing whatever he was trying to do.Maybe (the thought had come to her) it was worth trying to be like that,not being scared, just doing whatever, and seeing what happened to her,it couldn’t really be worse.The Endless Stair stopped turning.The great oaken door in front of them with the brass griffin knockeropened without being touched.Behind a black oaken desk with dozens of drawers facing in everydirection, looking like it had drawers set inside other drawers, was thesilver-bearded Headmaster of Hogwarts upon his throne, Albus PercivalWulfric Brian Dumbledore, into whose gently twinkling eyes Hermionelooked for around three seconds before she was distracted by all the otherthings in the room.Some time later—she wasn’t sure how long but it was while she wastrying to count the number of things in the room for the third time andstill not getting the same answer, even though her memory insisted thatnothing had been added or removed—the Headmaster cleared his throatand said, “Miss Granger?”Hermione’s head snapped around, and she felt a little heat in hercheeks; but Dumbledore didn’t appear annoyed with her at all, onlyserene, and with an inquiring look in those mild, half-glassed eyes.“Hermione,” said Professor McGonagall, the older witch’s voice wasgentle and her hand rested reassuringly on Hermione’s shoulder, “pleasetell the Headmaster what you said to me about Harry.”Hermione began speaking, despite her newfound resolution hervoice still stumbled a little with nervousness, as she described how Harryhad changed in the last few weeks since Fawkes had been on his shoulder.When she was done there was a pause, and then the Headmastersighed. “I am sorry, Hermione Granger,” said Dumbledore. Those blue




eyes had grown sadder as she spoke. “That is… unfortunate, but I cannotsay it is unexpected. That is a hero’s burden, which you see.”“A hero?” said Hermione. She looked up nervously at Professor McGonagall and saw that the Transfiguration Professor’s face had grown tight,though her hand still squeezed Hermione’s shoulder reassuringly.“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “I was a hero myself once, before I was a mysterious old wizard, in the days when I opposed Grindelwald. You haveread history books, Miss Granger?”Hermione nodded.“Well,” said Dumbledore, “that is what heroes have to do, Miss Granger, they have their tasks and they must grow strong to accomplish them,and that is what you see happening to Harry. If there is anything that canbe done to gentle his pathway, then you will be the one to do it, and not I.For I am not Harry’s friend, alas, but only his mysterious old wizard.”“I—” said Hermione. “I’m not sure—I still want to be—” Her voicestopped, it seemed too awful to say aloud.Dumbledore closed his eyes, and when he opened them, he looked alittle older than before. “No one can stop you, Miss Granger, if you chooseto stop being Harry’s friend. As for what it would do to him, you mayknow that better than I.”“That—doesn’t seem fair,” Hermione said, her voice trembling. “ThatI’ve got to be Harry’s friend because he’s got no one else? That doesn’tseem fair.”“Being a friend is not something you can be forced to, Miss Granger.”The blue eyes seemed to look right through her. “The feelings are there,or they are not. If they are there, you can accept them or deny them. Youare Harry’s friend—and choosing to deny it would wound him terribly,perhaps beyond healing. But Miss Granger, what would drive you to suchextremes?”She couldn’t find words. She’d never been able to find words. “If youget too near Harry—you get swallowed up, and no one sees you any more,you’re just something of his, everyone thinks the whole world revolvesaround him and…” She didn’t have the words.The old wizard nodded slowly. “It is indeed an unjust world we live in,Miss Granger. All the world now knows that it is I who defeated Grindel* 1049 *




wald, and fewer remember Elizabeth Beckett who died opening the wayso I could pass through. And yet she is remembered. Harry Potter is thehero of this play, Miss Granger; the world does revolve around him. Heis destined for great things; and I ween that in time the name of AlbusDumbledore will be remembered as Harry Potter’s mysterious old wizard, more than for anything else I have done. And perhaps the name ofHermione Granger will be remembered as his companion, if you proveworthy of it in your day. For this I tell you true: never will you find moreglory on your own, than in Harry Potter’s company.”Hermione shook her head rapidly. “But that’s not—” She’d knownshe wouldn’t be able to explain. “It’s not about glory, it’s about being—something that belongs to someone else!”“So you think you would rather be the hero?” The old wizard sighed.“Miss Granger, I have been a hero, and a leader; and I would have been athousand times happier if I could have belonged to someone like HarryPotter. Someone made of sterner stuff than I, to make the hard decisions,and yet worthy to lead me. I thought, once, that I knew such a man, butI was mistaken… Miss Granger, you have no idea at all how fortunate arethose like you, compared to heroes.”The hot burning feeling was creeping up her throat again, alongwith helplessness, she didn’t understand why Professor McGonagall hadbrought her here if the Headmaster wasn’t going to help, and from aglance at Professor McGonagall’s face, it looked like Professor McGonagall also wasn’t sure now that it had been a good idea.“I don’t want to be a hero,” said Hermione Granger, “I don’t want tobe a hero’s companion, I just want to be me.”(The thought came to her a few seconds later that maybe she did infact want to be a hero, but she decided not to change what she’d said.)“Ah,” said the old wizard. “That is a tall order, Miss Granger.” Dumbledore rose from his throne, stepped out behind his desk, and pointedto a symbol on the wall, so ubiquitous that Hermione’s eyes had glossedright over it; a faded shield on which was inscribed the heraldry of Hogwarts, the lion and snake, and badger and raven, and in Latin engravedwords whose point she’d never understood. Then, as she realized wherethat shield was, and how old it looked, it suddenly occurred to Hermione




that this might be the original—“A Hufflepuff would say,” said Dumbledore, tapping his finger on thefaded badger and making Hermione wince for the sacrilege (if it was theoriginal), “that people fail to become who they are meant to be, becausethey are too lazy to put in all the work involved. A Ravenclaw,” tappingthe raven, “would repeat those words that the wise know to be far olderthan Socrates, know thyself, and say that people fail to become who theyare meant to be, through ignorance and lack of thought. And SalazarSlytherin,” Dumbledore frowned as his finger tapped the faded snake,“why, he said that we become who we are meant to be by following ourdesires wherever they lead. Perhaps he would say that people fail to become themselves because they refuse to do what is necessary to achievetheir ambitions. But then one notes that nearly all of the Dark Wizards tocome out of Hogwarts have been Slytherins. Did they become what theywere meant to be? I think not.” Dumbledore’s finger tapped the lion, andthen he turned toward her. “Tell me, Miss Granger, what would a Gryffindor say? I do not need to ask whether the Sorting Hat offered you thatHouse.”It didn’t seem like a hard question. “A Gryffindor would say that people don’t become who they should be, because they’re afraid.”“Most people are afraid, Miss Granger,” said the old wizard. “They livetheir whole lives circumscribed by crippling fear that cuts off everythingthey might accomplish, everything they might become. Fear of sayingor doing the wrong thing, fear of losing their mere possessions, fear ofdeath, and above all the fear of what other people will think of them. Suchfear is a most terrible thing, Miss Granger, and it is terribly important toknow that. But it is not what Godric Gryffindor would have said. Peoplebecome who they are meant to be, Miss Granger, by doing what is right.”The old wizard’s voice was gentle. “So tell me, Miss Granger, what seemsto you like the right choice? For that is who you truly are, and whereverthat path leads, that is who you are meant to become.”There was a long space filled with the sounds of things that could notbe counted.She thought about it, because she was a Ravenclaw.“I don’t think it’s right,” Hermione said slowly, “for someone to have

to live inside someone else’s shadow like that…”“Many things in the world are not right,” said the old wizard, “thequestion is what is right for you to do about them. Hermione Granger, Ishall be less subtle than is usual for a mysterious old wizard, and tell yououtright that you cannot imagine how badly things could go if the eventssurrounding Harry Potter turn to ill. His quest is a matter you would noteven dream of walking away from, if you knew.”“What quest?” said Hermione. Her voice was trembling, becauseit was very clear what answer the Headmaster was looking for and shedidn’t want to give it. “What happened to Harry back then, why wasFawkes on his shoulder?”“He grew up,” said the old wizard. His eyes blinked several times,beneath the half-moon glasses, and his face suddenly looked very lined.“You see, Miss Granger, people do not grow up because of time, peoplegrow up when they are placed in grownup situations. That is whathappened to Harry Potter that Saturday. He was told—you are not toshare this information with anyone, you understand—he was told thathe would have to fight someone. I cannot tell you who. I cannot tell youwhy. But that is what happened to him, and why he needs his friends.”There was a pause.“Bellatrix Black?” Hermione said. She couldn’t have been moreshocked if someone had plugged an electrical cord into her ear. “You’regoing to make Harry fight Bellatrix Black?”“No,” said the old wizard. “Not her. I cannot tell you who, or why.”She thought about it some more.“Is there any way I can keep up with Harry?” said Hermione. “I mean,I’m not saying it’s what I’ll do, but—if he needs friends then can we beequal friends? Can I be a hero too?”“Ah,” said the old wizard, and smiled. “Only you can decide that, MissGranger.”“But you’re not going to help me like you’re helping Harry.”The old wizard shook his head. “I have helped him little enough, MissGranger. And if you are asking me for a quest—” The old wizard smiledagain, rather wryly. “Miss Granger, you are in your first year of Hogwarts.Do not be too eager to grow up; there will be time enough for that later.”




“I’m twelve. Harry’s eleven.”“Harry Potter is special,” said the old wizard. “As you know, MissGranger.” The blue eyes were suddenly piercing beneath the half-moonglasses, and she was reminded of the day of the Dementor when Dumbledore’s voice had said, inside her mind, that he knew about Harry’s darkside.Hermione put up her hand and touched Professor McGonagall’s hand,which had stayed strong on her shoulder this whole time, and Hermionesaid, she was surprised that her voice didn’t break, “I’d like to go, now,please.”“Of course,” said Professor McGonagall, and Hermione felt the handon her shoulder gently turning her around to face the oaken door.“Have you chosen your path yet, Hermione Granger?” said AlbusDumbledore’s voice from behind her, even as the door slowly creakedopen to reveal the Enchantment of the Endless Stair.She nodded.“And?”“I’ll,” she said, her voice stuck, “I’ll, I’ll—”She swallowed.“I’ll do—what’s right—”She didn’t say anything else, she couldn’t, and then the Endless Stairbegan revolving around her once again.Neither she nor Professor McGonagall spoke on the way down.When the Flowing Stone gargoyles stepped out of their way, and thetwo of them stepped out into the corridors of Hogwarts, Professor McGonagall finally spoke, and she said in a whisper, “I’m so terribly sorry, MissGranger. I did not think the Headmaster would say such things to you. Ithink he truly has forgotten what it is like to be a child.”Hermione glanced back up to her and saw that Professor McGonagalllooked like she was about to burst into tears… only not really, but therewas a tightness in her face that was like that.“If I want to be a hero too,” said Hermione, “if I’ve decided to be a herotoo, is there anything you can do to help?”Professor McGonagall rapidly shook her head, and said, “Miss Granger, I’m not sure the Headmaster is wrong about that. You are twelve.”




“Okay,” said Hermione.They walked forward a bit.“Excuse me,” said Hermione, “is it okay if I walk back to the Ravenclawtower by myself? I’m sorry, it’s not your fault or anything, I just want tobe by myself right now.”“Of course, Miss Granger,” said Professor McGonagall, her voicesounding a little hoarse, and Hermione heard her footsteps stop, andthen turn around behind her.Hermione Granger walked away.She climbed a flight of stairs, and then another, wondering if therewas anyone else in Hogwarts who would give her a chance to be a hero.Professor Flitwick would say the same thing as Professor McGonagall,and even if he didn’t, he probably couldn’t help, Hermione didn’t knowwho could help. Well, Professor Quirrell would come up with somethingclever if she used up enough Quirrell points, but she had a feeling that asking him would be a bad idea—that the Defense Professor couldn’t helpanyone become the sort of hero that was worth becoming, and that hewouldn’t even understand the difference.She had almost gotten to the Ravenclaw tower when she saw the flashof gold.



t was out of the corner of her eye that Hermione Granger saw it, a reflection on the polished metal of a statue at the junction of two corridors, a flash of gold, a flash of red, something like an image of fire; justfor a moment she saw it, and then it was gone.She paused, puzzled, and she almost walked away, but there had beensomething familiar about that brief glow—Hermione walked forward to where the statue had stood, looked atthe corridor from which she thought the fiery reflection might have come.Faintly, as though from a faraway place, she heard the cry, the call.Hermione started to run.She ran for a while; whenever she got to a junction she would pause,catch as much breath as she could, and then she would see a flash of firereflected from one direction or another, or hear that distant call. If ithadn’t been for her army training she would’ve fallen over in exhaustion,running like that.She never saw the phoenix.And then she came to a four-way branch and there was nothing, nosign, she waited for long seconds and she heard no cry and saw no fire,and she was only just starting to wonder with a sick sad feeling if she’dimagined the whole thing, when she heard a person cry out.When her rapidly racing feet turned the corner her mind took in thewhole scene at a glance, three huge boys in green-trimmed robes alreadyturning to look at her, and one shorter and smaller boy in yellow, who wasdangling in the air from one foot held up high by an invisible hand.






The Sunshine General didn’t even think about it, people who stoppedto think didn’t spring very good ambushes.Her wand was in her hand, her fingers did the twist and her lips said“Somnium!” and the largest bully fell over, the Hufflepuff boy dropped outof the air with a thump and the other two bullies were trying to aim theirwands at her and she said “Somnium!” again and another huge boy keeledover—the one who’d been aiming his wand faster, that was who she’dfired at.Unfortunately casting two Sleep Hexes in a row like that was hardeven for her, and she couldn’t get off a third before—The last bully shouted “Protego!” and was surrounded by a shimmeringblue glow.Twenty-four hours ago, Hermione would have panicked at that, a realShielding Charm would let the bully-boy cast spells on her even while hewas protected.Now she—“Stupefy!” shouted the bully-boy.The crimson bolt blasted toward her with a terrible brilliance, blazingfar brighter than any hex that had sprung from Harry’s wand.Hermione swayed slightly to the left, and the bolt missed, because thebully’s aim hadn’t been nearly as good as Harry’s; and the thought cameto her that maybe bullies and Professor Quirrell’s armies didn’t mix.“Stupefy!” shouted the bully-boy again. “Expelliarmus! Stupefy!”Anyway, now she’d just spent a whole hour thinking of all the otherspells she could’ve cast on Harry and Neville—“Jellyfy!” yelled the bully-boy, a wide-beam jinx with no visible bolt tododge, and her knees suddenly felt almost too weak to support her. Andthen, with an angry roar producing an even brighter blaze of crimson,“Stupefy!”She dodged that one by deliberately falling, and by then she’d recovered enough for her next spell, which was—“Glisseo,” said Hermione, directing her remark to the floor.“Oof,” said the bully-boy as his feet went out from under him and heactually dropped his wand.The Protego winked out.




“Somnium,” said Hermione.She was still breathing in gasps as she crawled over to where the Hufflepuff boy was sitting up, and groaning and rubbing his skull where he’dbeen dropped head-first into the floor; it was a good thing he hadn’t beena Muggle, Hermione realized, or he might have snapped his neck. Shehadn’t actually thought of that.“Uh,” said the boy, his hair was of a color that would’ve been called‘brunette’ if he was a girl, his eyes an undistinguished brown that somehow seemed just right for Hufflepuff, there weren’t any tears on his facebut he looked sort of pale. She pegged him at about fourth year, or third.Then the brown eyes widened as he focused on her. “General Sunshine?”“Yeah,” she said. “That’s (gasp) me.” If the Hufflepuff boy said anything about her being Harry Potter’s love interest, she decided, he wasgoing to die.“Wow,” said the Hufflepuff boy. “That was—you just—I mean I sawyou on the screens before Christmas but—wow! I can’t believe you justdid that!”There was a pause.I can’t believe I just did that, thought Hermione Granger, who was feeling a little faint all of a sudden, it must have been all that running. “Excuse (gasp) me,” she said, “can you (gasp) Unjellyfy my legs?”The boy nodded, pushed himself to his feet, and reached inside hisrobes for his wand; but Hermione had to correct his gesture before thecounter-Jinx worked right.“I’m Michael Hopkins,” said the boy once Hermione had rolled backto her own feet. He stuck out his hand. “Or just Mike inside Hufflepuff,there aren’t any other Mikes in all of Hufflepuff this year, would you believe it?”They shook hands, and Mike said, “Anyway, thank you.”Hermione wasn’t prepared for the rush of euphoria that hit her then,saving someone like that literally felt better than anything she’d ever feltin her whole life.She turned to look at the bullies.
